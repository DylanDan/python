LLC", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation First Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Jeff Jacobson, Chief Executive Officer. He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements. Which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on our financial progress in the quarter as well as our expectations for 2017. Let me begin by saying that overall, I am pleased with our start to the year. Our operational performance delivered revenue, operating margin and cash flow that were all in line with our expectations for the quarter. Additionally, we made progress on our strategy to pursue the growing segments in the market. Recognizing that this is the first quarter out of four, and we still have a lot to do, our performance laid the foundation for us to deliver on our full year commitments.", "Let me walk you through an overview of our first quarter financial results. The first quarter was a good start to the year. We delivered GAAP EPS of $0.02 and adjusted EPS of $0.15. Our earnings were impacted by a charge related to our 25% equity ownership of Fuji Xerox resulting in the $0.03 reduction in our GAAP and adjusted EPS. If this charge was excluded, our first quarter EPS was in line with our expectations for the quarter. Revenue of $2.45 billion was down 6.2% year-over-year or 4.3% on a constant-currency basis consistent with 2016. We experienced softness in Europe which was offset by improvements in our developing markets.", "We saw a rebound in equipment sale revenue. While down 7.4% or 5.7% at constant currency it was better than the declines of 10.1% in the fourth quarter and 8.7% during the full year of 2016 in constant currency. High-end products recovered and we had better results in entry products driven by developing markets and early benefits from newly introduced color products. Post sale revenue was 80% of total revenue, and declined 5.8% or 3.9% at constant currency. Most post sale revenue stream trends were stable, but we did see a deceleration in Managed Document Services revenue. This was partially driven by lower signings in prior quarters.", "We have high expectations for this business and we are taking actions and making investments to drive improvement. Our newly launched products will allow us to be more competitive and our channel expansion initiatives will make our industry-leading Xerox Partner Print Services offering available to more partners. We expect to begin to see benefits in the second half of the year.", "Adjusted operating margin excluding the impact of the Fuji Xerox charge was 11.4%, an improvement of 90 basis points year-over-year despite a 110 basis point headwind from currency. We continue to realize productivity benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives, which are helping maintain our profitability and strong margins while offsetting our revenue decline.", "Operating cash flow was up $103 million year-over-year driven by working capital, a good start to the year, but I would also highlight that our cash flow does not yet reflect higher pension contributions which are expected during the balance of the year. We repaid $1.3 billion in debt during the quarter as part of our plan to optimize our capital structure and maintain investment-grade metrics. Our results are indicative of our ability to operate the business well and to continue to deliver on our productivity and cost savings initiatives as we work to change the trajectory of our revenue.", "In December, we shared with you our plan to drive long-term earnings expansion and reverse our revenue trajectory over time. It's a two-pronged approach. We are improving our efficiency and changing the way we work with our strategic transformation program, while aggressively pursuing strategic growth areas in our market. During the first quarter, we made progress on both initiatives. We are now in the second year of our three-year strategic transformation program and are on track to deliver $600 million in gross savings this year. We are driving increased productivity to expand margins while offsetting significant currency headwinds and enabling us to reinvest in the business.", "We remain relentless in our efforts to improve our internal processes and systems to capture productivity in our work. Initiatives range small to large, local to global, and here are two examples. We are rolling out a new deal scoring process that includes a dynamic pricing methodology in our proposal and pricing tool. This process provides business intelligence to our sales resources. The expected outcomes are improvements in the turnaround of customer pricing proposals, increases in our win rate and the capture of margin upside to our new signings.", "In our supply chain, we completed the transition of our major U.S. equipment warehouse to a third-party logistics provider as part of our optimization efforts. Our global supply chain and field teams work together to make ensure we continue to serve our customers during the transition and ensure all first quarter customer orders were delivered and installed.", "Turning to the strategic growth areas. In 2016, 62% of our revenue was in mature markets. So to ensure we can change the revenue trajectory, we are working to maintain our leadership positions in those mature markets, while shifting more of our business into the growth markets.", "We've targeted four strategic growth areas to pursue. First is Managed Document Services. We are the leader in this segment and we are building both new offerings, such as customized analytics and personalized workflows, as well as extending our reach to more customers including small and medium-sized businesses, or SMBs.", "Second is A4 Entry products. This area includes desktop and multifunction printers, where we are underpenetrated. Pages in this area are moving from single function A4 size printers to higher value A4 multifunction printers, where we are better positioned. New A4 products will strengthen our Managed Document Services solutions and offerings to all our channels.", "Third, we are going to leverage channel partners to reach the SMB. We are adding partners that understand this industry, are local experts, are close to the customers and are looking to grow their own businesses and provide great experiences for their customers.", "Finally, production color, including inkjet and packaging. We are extending our leadership position in cut-sheet color, building a footprint in the growing inkjet market and creating new solutions that both automate and customize packaging. In the first quarter, 39% of our revenue was in our targeted growth areas, representing a mix improvement of 2 points year-over-year. Additionally, we laid the foundation for continued progress with the launch of new products. The big news in the quarter was the announcement of the largest product launch in our company's history, 29 new entry and workgroup multifunction devices.", "The new portfolio is the next stage of the product strategy we started in 2013 when we launched ConnectKey, the first ecosystem-based platform for A3 workgroup devices. We followed that up in subsequent years with a broader range of specialized apps, customizable workflows, and solutions to deliver a better user experience. And now we are increasing the range of ConnectKey-enabled devices to include both A3 and Entry and workgroup A4 with fleet coherency between A3 and A4 devices.", "These new products extend the functionality of multifunction printers. They go beyond the base printing, copying, scanning and faxing functions and change the fundamental nature of the connected workplace, with features and the ability to use customized apps that enable a truly personalized experience. The portfolio directly supports three of our strategic growth areas. Each new device is ConnectKey-enabled, perfect for Managed Document Services where a common toolset will make it easier to monitor, manage and optimize a fleet of devices more effectively.", "Twelve of the new devices are A4-sized and will give us a significant presence in the A4 market where our participation has been limited. The new A4 products are cost-competitive, cloud-connected, app-enabled, and possess benchmark security, a perfect fit for SMBs that are looking for more than just print, copy, scan and faxing capabilities to help them grow.", "Finally, these new devices are ideal for our channel partners. By selling existing apps or creating custom apps, dealers can achieve real differentiation and stickiness with their customers. A number of new ConnectKey products are available now, others will roll out during the second and third quarters of 2017. We expect to see the impact on our results start to ramp during the second half of the year.", "The fourth strategic growth area is production color. As I mentioned, we saw a rebound in equipment sale revenue during the quarter, including high-end color, and we continue to take steps to drive additional activity. We were present in several important trade shows, demonstrating our inkjet technology among others, and during the first week of April we launched three new production color products: the Versant 180, Versant 180 performance package, and Versant 3100 presses with many new features that exceed what's currently available in the market and complement our growing line of production print engines. My thanks to the Xerox team for their efforts to improve our business, bring new products to market, and serve our customers well during the quarter.", "I'll now turn the call to our CFO, Bill Osbourn.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Before diving into quarter one results, I want to highlight a few changes we've made to our reporting beginning in 2017. As we previewed last quarter, post the spinoff of Conduent, we have streamlined the management of the business along geographic sales channels and, therefore, now have one reportable segment. We are at the same time enhancing our disclosures to provide additional insight on our results. Around revenue, we are providing additional details by geographic sales channel, by product grouping for equipment sales revenue, and will continue to provide line-of-sight to our document outsourcing, or what we now call Manage Document Services revenues, as well as progress on the shift over time of our revenues toward our strategic growth areas.", "On profitability, we'll be providing gross margins for both equipment and post sale revenues. On cash flow, we're providing some commentary around our expectations for normalized operating cash flow after we get past near-term higher restructuring payments and pension contributions. We believe these reporting changes will give greater context to our results and perspective of our business model. I'll talk more about them as we go through the presentation.", "With that, let's start with the review of the income statement, which I'm going to mainly talk to on an adjusted basis that excludes non-service retirement-related costs, restructuring and related costs, and amortization of intangible assets. In addition, this quarter, we had two other discrete items that we adjusted for, and that essentially offset, a $13 million charge related to the extinguishment of debt and a $16 million benefit from the remeasurement of a tax matter related to a previously-adjusted item. Revenue, which I will cover in more detail on the next slide, was down $161 million, or 6.2% in actual currency, or 4.3% at constant currency, which is consistent with full-year 2016.", "Looking at the cost ratios, savings from our strategic transformation program more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction-currency impact of 110 basis points, resulting in gross margin expansion of 20 basis points and an improvement in SAG as a percentage of revenue of 20 basis points. Within our definition of operating income is equity income, which was down year-over-year due to the Fuji Xerox receivable write-off that Jeff mentioned.", "As Fujifilm recently announced, they are reviewing the appropriateness of accounting practices related to certain sales of leasing transactions involving Fuji Xerox New Zealand. Our first quarter results included charge of approximately $30 million within equity income, representing our share of the current Fujifilm estimated adjustment for this review. Although the approximate $0.03 impact of the Fuji Xerox New Zealand receivable matter is included in our adjusted EPS, we are modifying our definition of adjusted operating margin to exclude this matter in order to present a more normalized view. On this basis, overall adjusted operating margin expanded 90 basis points and adjusted operating profit was up $6 million. So, from an operating perspective, overall good cost management offset revenue declines consistent with our expectations.", "Turning to the below-the-line items, other expenses net of $41 million was $4 million better year-over-year as lower interest expense roughly offset the gain on sales of assets in the prior year. The tax rate of 27.5% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28%, and was higher by 6.1 points year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.01 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS.", "Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.15 was down $0.03 from Q1 2016 driven by the higher tax rate and the Fuji Xerox matter. GAAP EPS was $0.02 in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets, as well as the two discrete items I described earlier.", "Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. Starting with total revenue, from a geographic perspective, North America was down 4.5%, or 4.8% in constant currency, and represented 60% of our revenues. International represented 35% of total revenue, and reflected higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we saw a turn there and overall improvement off a weak Q1 2016. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, which includes our OEM business, sales of Fuji Xerox and licensing.", "Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 7.4%, or 5.7% in constant currency. From a product-offering perspective, entry equipment sales was down 6.4%, or 5.5% in constant currency, an improvement in trend reflecting the rebound in developing markets, as well as early benefits from new products offset by continued higher OEM equipment declines.", "Mid-range was down 8.6%, or 7% in constant currency, so relatively weaker, but anticipated given that none of our recently-announced new mid-range workplace products were available in quarter one. Lastly, we saw better performance in high-end equipment sales, which were down 6.1%, or 3.7% in constant currency, an improvement from the fourth quarter.", "A couple of points to highlight in the high-end. First, color equipment grew 1% in constant currency; and, second, the growth was driven by the higher end of the portfolio, continuous feed and iGen products. Entry production color products were down year-over-year, as we have yet to benefit from the new Versant products we only just announced.", "Moving on. Post sale revenue was down 5.8% or 3.9% in constant currency. This compares to a decline of 2.9% in 2016. The higher Q1 post sale decline was driven by Managed Document Services, which essentially is our previously reported document outsourcing revenues now expanded to include Managed Print Services within Global Imaging. In Q1, Managed Document Services was 33% of our revenues. It was down 2% in actual currency and up 0.4% in constant currency. This compares to 2.6% constant currency growth in 2016.", "The slowdown can be attributed to lower signings in recent quarters within the enterprise space, as well as a challenging compare in Q1 as Q1 2016 Managed Document Services was up 4.9% in constant currency driven by strong equipment growth.", "I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a view which I have already touched on. Strategic growth areas in the first quarter grew 1% in constant currency and comprised 39% of our total revenues, a 2 point mix shift from the year ago period. The growth of 1% did not reflect benefits from our newly launched products and compares to growth of 2% in 2016 with the trend change coming from the Managed Document Services component I just discussed. Jeff highlighted earlier that we made progress in Q1 laying the foundation to drive improvement in strategic growth areas with a target to shift the mix by approximately 3 points this year.", "Turning to installs, as expected, color was stronger than black and white. We saw improved performance in entry, although a weaker mix given the better developing markets performance where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio. Mid-range installs likewise were dampened as expected by not benefiting yet from the newly launched products. And high-end installs were weaker than equipment revenue performance I described earlier as mix improved the stronger performance in the higher-end products like continuous feed and iGen, offsetting install declines in entry production products given product launch timing.", "Signings in the quarter of $532 million were down 6% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency. With that, we did see improvement in new business signings which were up 1% year-over-year at constant currency. Signings, as Jeff mentioned, is an area where we are making investments in sales coverage and taking action to drive better results. I should note that we only have a line of sight to signings in the lower growth large enterprise areas. So broadly speaking, total Managed Document Services revenue growth outperformed signings as the higher market growth is coming from the SMB area.", "The last key measurement I'd like to cover is strategic transformation. This is a critical program to drive both expanding margins and enabling investments to improve revenue trajectory. We have many projects underway spanning the company and we continue to target $600 million in gross savings for 2017. We took, as anticipated, a fairly large restructuring charge of $120 million in quarter one to position us to achieve our full year gross savings objectives. There are headwinds related to revenue declines as well as currency that partially offset these savings, but net-net we anticipate continued margin expansion for the full year.", "Before moving on to cash flow, I'd like to take some time to cover the trends we're sitting at a high level and how we expect them to play out as we progress through the year. The total revenue decline of 4.3% in constant currency was consistent with 2016 and an improvement over Q4. We continue to expect full year constant currency revenue declines in the mid-single digits with about 2 points of negative translation currency.", "From a calendarization perspective, Q2 will face the most challenging year-over-year compare and we won't see a full quarter's benefit from the new product launch. So net-net, we'd expect higher declines in Q2 with moderating declines in the second half driven by improving equipment revenue trends.", "Operating margin is seasonally weakest in Q1 so we expect improvement in absolute terms as we move through the year supported by our continued focus on our transformation and productivity initiatives. Transaction currency is dampening some of that improvement and was a negative 110-basis-point year-over-year impact to margin in Q1. At current rates, we expect a slightly higher negative impact in Q2 and more moderate impacts in the second half.", "Lastly, and looking at the trends for adjusted EPS, we are continuing to guide for full year adjusted EPS between $0.80 and $0.88, which compares to $0.88 in 2016. The drivers of full year 2017 adjusted EPS as we highlighted last quarter are currency and the higher tax rate partially offset by lower interest expense. These factors impacted our first quarter results and while we're not giving guidance for the second quarter, we expect EPS to decline year-over-year in Q2 before we get into the second half where compares should ease as currencies should moderate at current rates and benefits from our recent product launches should begin to flow through.", "I will now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow generation coming from continuing operations in the quarter was $190 million, up $103 million year-over-year and free cash flow was $164 million, up $109 million year-over-year. So a good result driven in part by working capital timing as inventories were a smaller use year-over-year given product launch timing and payables were also a source. As we indicated last quarter, our operating cash flow guidance of $700 million to $900 million will be about $200 million lower this year than normalized operating cash flow of about $1 billion driven by higher restructuring payments and pension contributions.", "Q1 operating cash flow reflected the higher restructuring payment expectations, $60 million versus $21 million in the prior year. The pension contributions of $23 million were only a small portion of our guidance of $350 million for the full year. Investing cash flows were a use of $35 million and included CapEx spend of $26 million and $11 million related to a small GIS acquisition. Cash used in financing was over $1 billion and reflected $1.3 billion in senior note repayments and $87 million in dividends, both common and preferred.", "Turning now to the capital structure slide I will spend a few minutes on debt before handing it back to Jeff. We ended Q1 with $5 billion of debt, which is lower than 2016 ending debt of $6.3 billion reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments I just highlighted. Two elements made up the repayments. The first was the repayment of $1 billion associated with two senior notes that matured.", "In addition, in the quarter we exchanged $600 million of certain senior notes due 2018 through 2020 for $300 million in cash and $300 million in new senior notes due 2022 with a fixed coupon rate of 4.07%. This transaction in essence allowed us to early retire $300 million in debt and extend out the term of an additional $300 million.", "Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.7 billion is allocated to financing debt calculated by a fine of 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $472 million of equipment on operating leases. This financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage.", "So, to summarize, overall a positive start to the year with most operational metrics in line with expectations, putting us on track to meet our full-year guidance.", "With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you, Bill. During the quarter, I made several international and domestic trips to meet with customers, partners and employees; it's one of the most important parts of my job. It enables me to have an unfiltered view of what is occurring in our operations, while having direct discussions with our stakeholders. Our customers are always candid in their assessments of how we are doing. They have told me they are pleased with our renewed focus on the document technology market and the new products we've introduced, and that we can never let up on our efforts to serve them better and bring innovations to market that make the way they work easier; they depend on Xerox to keep them at the forefront of technology.", "Our partners and potential partners provide a great perspective on their local markets. They continue to challenge us to be better and our team has stepped up with new products, tools and support to make us the partner of choice. And employees, the heart and soul of our company, are engaged and excited about the opportunities we have before us.", "We understand the realities of the market and the needs of our customers and partners, and we are laying the foundation to deliver what is needed to win. I feel good about the new products and offerings being launched, our strategic direction and our operating discipline. The strategic transformation program remains a critical focus to continue to drive strong margins and cash flow while we work on reversing the revenue trajectory.", "All in all, we made good progress in the first quarter. We have more work to do and the team is intensely focused on delivering on our full-year commitments.", "We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, let me point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much. I wanted to ask first about cash flow. It seems like you're a little bit more positive in terms of the normalized cash flow at $1 billion. So sort of what's getting you there? What are you seeing in terms of opportunity on the working capital side? Again, I understand this year you have puts and takes with more restructuring and that, but when you get into 2018, can you talk a little bit about how you are thinking about cash flow? And then if you can talk a bit about how you are thinking about cash usage, if anything has changed and where you plan on sort of targeting it? Especially given the stock at this point is down in \u2013 at $6.73 you could probably buy back a fair amount?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hi, Shannon. This is Bill Osbourn. I'll touch on that. So, cash flow, as we talked about at the year-end earnings call, it's really the same thoughts or similar thoughts that \u2013 both 2017 and 2018 would be below what we would think our normalized cash flow would be, about $1 billion. And the two primary items which you mentioned are the higher pension contributions over that period of time being approximately $100 million-plus higher each given year. And then also, we were going to have higher restructuring payments each of those two years as we were doing our strategic transformation. We would expect those to normalize and have a $200 million-plus benefit versus to get to a more normalized $1 billion cash flow in 2019 and beyond.", "So similar to what we said at year-end both 2017 and 2018 would be dampened by approximately $200 million. We are working continuously to improve our working capital both from an inventory management perspective, managing receivables, payables, timing, et cetera, and we have some specific projects in place to really focus on inventory management, but the primary things impacting the normalized cash flow are the higher restructuring payments this year and next year, and the higher pension contributions. As far as your second part of your question regarding the uses of cash, similar thoughts to year-end.", "Given the $700 million to $900 million of operating cash flow we're expecting this year, and our cash on hand on the balance sheet at the end of the year, we projected to have about $1 billion to $1.2 billion in cash available. We're going to pay down incremental $300 million of debt, which we did during the quarter; dividends around $280 million, CapEx we're guiding about $175 million and M&A in the $100 million range. That left, if you're doing the math, about $100 million to $300 million that we're evaluating the best uses of, whether that's paying down additional debt, whether M&A opportunities come along, et cetera.", "At this point, although we continually look at it regarding share repurchases, we're not planning on making any share repurchase at this time, but as you state, we'll look at the market and factors, share price, and we evaluate it, but at this point our goal is to invest in future growth opportunities and maintain the quality of our balance sheet.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Okay. Great.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you. And then just one quick follow-up.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Jeff, can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing environment and specifically as the yen has moved between JPY 100 and JPY 120 in the last few months, and now it's sort of in the middle, how are you sort of thinking about, and seeing, from the Japanese competitors, their reaction in terms of being able to use the yen for pricing or perhaps pulling back a little bit? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hi, Shannon. How are you? Yeah. We've seen pricing being very stable in our market. If we look at the last few quarters, extremely stable both certainly in equipment as you've seen from some of our Japanese competitors. They've actually made some public statements about trying to manage their businesses more for profitability. So, we've seen relatively stable market dynamic as we go through.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I'd like to dig deeper into the transformation savings program. You provided some examples of efficiencies you've achieved including better sales force, business intelligence, better supply chain management. As you look ahead, can you elaborate on what additional actions are required to unlock the remaining strategic transformation savings to get to your $600 million gross savings target this year?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. So, George, how are you? This is Jeff, and then I'll let Bill supplement. We have a really diligent process, where literally the team goes through this on a weekly basis. It's a cadence of literally hundreds of projects from the way we deliver products, the way we build into our technical services group, remote connectivity, remote call assist, what we do in manufacturing, as I talked about we outsourced our warehouses.", "So when you look at the supply chain procurement, what we're doing in delivery, what we're bringing down \u2013 or doing to bring down our unit manufacturing costs, and certainly the area that we will continue to hit hard will be G&A. So as we move forward and we delayer the organization and continue to reduce the number of layers and our spans of control \u2013 actually, increase our spans of control, I think, we'll be seeing G&A come out even more. We're looking at things in our IT of how we can become more efficient in IT. I think, G&A is certainly an area where we can do a lot more work.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Just to follow-on, I was going to say the same thing. G&A, clearly, we're looking for areas to cut costs, where we are not going to be impacting future revenue growth, and G&A is one of those areas. We've done benchmark analyses and have identified areas that we plan on reducing costs in certain G&A sectors, and that will be clearly an area of focus.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Got it, and as a follow-up, some of those strategic savings will be reinvested back into the business. Can you talk about which areas of the business are priorities for reinvestments? And how to think about the timing of reinvestments and the implications from the cadence of margin expansion as we move through the year?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. There are \u2013 the reinvestment, clearly is \u2013 part of it is offsetting various headwinds from currency transactions, et cetera, but we are also utilizing these savings to reinvest in the business. Couple examples would be in \u2013 people may not think about it this way, but we are planning on and have been selling more A4s as part of our new product launch, and those have lower margins upfront. It's really investing in the business, because you get higher margins over the life of the product due to the post sale revenues, but it is actually an investment getting those machines in field, or MIP, out there, and our goal is to \u2013 this year to increase our volume of A4s of our new product launch. That is one example in particular.", "We are investing in systems, as Jeff mentioned, the delivery area. There are costs there. Some of it is CapEx, some of it's OpEx, and in some of our back-office IT infrastructure, we're also doing investments to be able to do things more efficiently and cost effective.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. And, George, this is Jeff, as Bill hit on it, some of the investments is certainly going into the revenue generation to change the revenue trajectory. So Bill mentioned the product launch. If you look at channel expansion and just bringing on new partners, whether they're mono-branded, multi-branded, there's demand generation, there's training required, one of the areas that Bill talked about we did grow a little bit in signings on new business generation, but we have a concerted program to hire what we call new logo hunters, just going after non-Xerox accounts that we have today. That's an area of focus. So, in some cases, where we're making trade-offs on G&A, we're investing it back into the S part of SG&A, for the selling, because we want to change that revenue trajectory.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "And about the timing of reinvestments?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. I mean, they're ongoing as we go. So what we do is we try not to get out ahead of our headlights, but if you look at it and you say basically our margin expansion was up 90 basis points offsetting the 110 basis points of currency that Bill talked about, but we're still investing in the business in a judicious way and a prudent way to change revenue trajectory. So it's ongoing.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Paul J. Chung - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks. This is Paul Chung on for Paul Coster. Thanks for taking my question. Just on the new product launch, how is the firm dealing with older products, whether in existing inventory, or in the channel? Are there any promotions going on for existing inventory?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. So, Paul, good question. We try to balance that all the time. So what we try to do is manage the inventory, manage the obsolescence, so there's no question. We do try to give some incentives, so that we can clear out the existing product line, but not in an excessive rate by any means, well, I'd say a prudent rate to clear out the existing inventory as the new products are going \u2013 coming in.", "So, I mean, if you were to look, for example, at our high-end business that from an equipment standpoint was down 3.7% in constant currency, which was an improvement, you might misjudge things if you were to look at the installs being down. The reason was, as Bill mentioned, we had good performance at the high-end with our production inkjet, with our iGen, which is the higher production devices of the high-end. But if you look at Versant basically orders were down a little bit from that standpoint because we were just introducing the three new Versant lines. So we manage that pretty diligently and our supply chain team does a great job.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you very much. And I just got to say the additional details provided in the slide and stuff are greatly appreciated, so we sincerely appreciate that. On the reported earnings, I think, they were about $0.15 and if I do the math correctly it looks like that includes the cost of the Fujifilm of about $0.03, and you're keep \u2013 if you can confirm that, and you're keeping the full year EPS unchanged. So in essence when you include Fuji costs, are you raising your full year because now you have Fuji costs or the investigation that's going on, or is that something that you're kind of always anticipating and maybe just now it's more communicating to us? And then I have a follow-up.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hey, Jim. It's Bill. Hey, great question. As far as the Fuji Xerox, just to confirm it is a $0.03 impact in our adjusted EPS, so the $0.15 adjusted EPS does include that $0.03 or $30 million charge, or we would have been say it another way, $0.18 without it.", "Clearly, we did not know anything when we gave guidance back in January about this charge when we were setting guidance for the full year. With that said, when you go throughout the year, and we update and we do detailed analyses internally projecting for the rest of the year, there are puts and takes that occur and I'm not going to go through all the details of those but one example of that is we give guidance at the beginning of the year and factor in a certain amount of transaction currency headwinds for the year. Updated based upon current foreign currency rates, we see that being a couple of pennies less for the rest of the year and that would be something that we factor in to our updated overall guidance analysis.", "So the $0.03 clearly was not expected; however, it is factored into the full year updated guidance now and when we look at other puts and takes that come into play as we update each quarter end and we're reaffirming the $0.80 and $0.88 and knowing that that $0.03 charge is in the Q1.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Great. And then my follow-up is regarding this $0.03 charge, is that the full EPS impact of the estimated liability or is that like the cost quarter-to-date or expected investigation cost or how should we think about is there still more risk of additional write-down or a $0.03, $0.05, $0.10 in future quarters?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. We're not going to go into really details regarding the Fuji Xerox matter other than what they have disclosed. Fujifilm put out a press release last week that specifically cited a \u00a522 billion receivable adjustment. This is our calculated estimate of the impact of that adjustment on our earnings. Fujifilm has stated that they are in the process of an investigation. The \u00a522 billion is their current estimate that they put out there. With that said, as we made in our note in our disclosures that could change, but we are not aware of anything additional at this point other than the \u00a522 billion, which we've calculated to have a $30 million impact.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks. Thank you so much for the details. That's greatly appreciated. Thank you.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Jim.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Jim. Operator next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Hi. Thank you for the question. Just a couple really, on the strategic part of your business, I think the $0.01 growth rate at constant currency. Am I right in thinking that accelerates in the back half driven by the product announcements? And then the second clarification I had, you mentioned the difficulty (42:54) you have in Q2. What is specifically the (42:56).", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Kulbinder, how are you? This is Jeff. I was having a little difficulty hearing your question, but I think it had something to do with the strategic growth areas growing at 1% at this point. We were overall relatively pleased with where we were from a revenue standpoint.", "So, if you go back to our beginning of the year guidance of mid-single-digit decline, coming in at 4.3% down was what I would say good for the first quarter, especially if you consider that we had a 90-basis-point impact from our OEM business and our CMS, which was a higher deceleration rate than we had last year.", "So if you back that out, we would've been at about 3.4% where instead of the 90 basis points we declined about 40 basis points last year on that rate. So that was really without the benefit of any of the new products. We did get four of the A4 products in towards the end of the quarter, so we got a little bit of a boost there. But what we've been saying consistently all along, as we bring the vast majority of the products out in the second quarter, a little overhang of the remaining A4 products into the third quarter is that we'll start seeing this ramp much more in the second half of the year. We did get the 2 point year-over-year movement from the 37% to the 39% into the growth markets. So we're pretty much on track for where we thought we'd be.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "And, Kulbinder, I think there is a second part to your question that we may have missed, if you want to repeat it?", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Yes. Just in Q2, what is causing the difficult compares you mentioned?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Hey, Kulbinder. It's Bill. Yes. A couple of things really from a difficult compare perspective, we're expecting a little bit bigger headwind in Q2 from a transaction currency perspective. Also, if you're looking at Q1 last year, we had not fully ramped up our strategic transformation, our restructuring process. By Q2 that had ramped up; it was in full swing. So we now have full ramped-up strategic transformation this year in Q2 and in last year in Q2, so that creates a little bit tougher compare. And we won't fully benefit from all the products being out in Q2. Most of them will be out in Q2, but it won't fully be there yet.", "So, with that said, we don't give \u2013 we're not giving formal quarterly guidance on adjusted EPS, or anything. But I think, historically, if you do the math, Q2 has been around 25% of the full year, and it looks to be in that zone for this year. The headwinds are really that transaction currency in Q2 this year, which we do, by the way, expect to moderate in the second half of this year.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. And, Kulbinder, also just to supplement from a revenue standpoint, last year, if you remember, we had the iSeries launch in the second quarter, so our equipment revenue was down at 4.9%, overall revenue was down at 3.4%. So that was our best quarter from a revenue standpoint in terms of relative decline. So just a little tougher compare. As Bill said, tougher compare top-line and a little more transactional currency in the second quarter, which will become a better story in the second half.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks. Good morning. With new business TCV growing again in the first quarter, albeit slightly versus the declines last year, can you just talk about where you are in terms of putting in place the sales force to chase new logos, and then just general ballpark of where you would want the new business TCV to be growing say exiting this year?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. Hi, Katy. How are you? This is Jeff. So if we go back to last year, last year was not a great year for us on new business signings. We were down for the total year actually at 18%. And I think one of the things that's important, as we talk about signings, we're actually referring to them now as enterprise signings. So about 80% of our Managed Document Services business today is in the enterprise. We really don't track signings for Global Imaging and for our Xerox Partner Print Services, which are more in the SMB arena where we expect to see the growth.", "So, again, just to look at the marketplace, $13 billion is the Managed Print Services market. $6 billion of that market, which is growing at about 2% is in the enterprise, where we're really looking to capitalize on the growth of the $7 billion of the SMB Managed Print Services space, growing at 7%. We did grow at 1% on new business signings. We were down at about 12% on the renewals but, again, those were in the enterprise. The new logo hunters we're starting to bring on now, those two take time to ramp.", "So from the time they come, if you think about hiring somebody from the outside, calling on new accounts that would be a ramp. We expect to get better ramp from the expanded channels, getting new partners, and certainly when the new products come and then, obviously, increasing our renewal rate, which was at about 81%. So we think the biggest benefits will come in the second half of the year really with the new product launch.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then just as a follow-up, you saw recovery in high-end equipment sales still spotty in some of the other segments just given the product launches but most of that is now in the field. And so, do you have line of sight as to when you would expect equipment sales to stabilize and/or grow again?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. So we were not dissatisfied by any means with the 5.7% decline in equipment revenue. If you look at the second half of last year, we were a little over 10% in constant currency declines in the second half and 8.7% for the full year. So the 5.7% was an improvement and, again, that was up without really getting the benefits.", "With the Versant launch, which was three new products, if we go back to whenever we've launched Versant in past years, we did get a nice bump. It's just coming in in April. So we would think, believe and hope and certainly in May and June we should start seeing the benefits of that.", "If I look at entry from an ESR standpoint, down 5.5% and if I look at the install, color installs were up 15%. Part of that was the nice bump we got towards the end when we did bring in four of the A4 products. Midrange really didn't help us. We didn't bring out any new products but in Q2 we will be bringing out all 17 of the mid-range A3 products, and again, I think that will help us much more in the second half of the year.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Katy.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you, Katy.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. I kind of wanted to follow up to that last question. I guess, given that the product launch hit at the end of the quarter and it was pretty well telegraphed that you guys were going to do it. Can you just talk about either quantitatively or even just qualitatively about the amount of demand hesitation that you saw just ahead of these new products hitting the market?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Thanks, Matt. That's a good point. You always see some of that. I mean, so that's why if you were to look \u2013 that's why you really have the disconnect, I'll say, between our installs on high end and the negative 3.7% actual equipment revenue recognized at high end. We had very positive mix with our inkjet installations as well as our iGen installations. Those are higher volume, higher-priced product or higher-priced products where the Versant, which is more of a volume type of play, what I'll call more of the entry production color. In anticipation of that, those installs were down significantly year-over-year. So, to your point, we always see that in our business that until the new products actually hit the supply chain that's when you'll see the orders start coming.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And, maybe, Jeff, just on that same point thinking a little bit more about the mid range, given the A3 launch that you had, was there any demand hesitation there that you saw as well?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. I mean, I think we would attribute that to being down to negative 7%. Certainly, the black-and-white that was down 24%, color was flat. So I don't think there's any question about that.", "When you look at our order flow and backlog, I think there definitely was that hesitation and as it starts hitting our supply chain, the normal course it would be to see it starting to flow better. And again, I think we'll get those benefits in the second half.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Matt. And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for everyone's interest. Jeff, anything more to wrap up?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. Thanks, Jennifer. Just thank you all for your questions. The first quarter was a positive beginning for the new Xerox. We are keenly focused on the work ahead of us and we are confident in our ability to meet our commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress as we go along and I want to thank you all for joining our call.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. That concludes our call today.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to, Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported the second quarter results that are largely in line with our guidance. During the call, we will update you on our strategy, provide detail on the second quarter, and share the areas where we are intensifying our focus throughout the balance of the year. Let\u2019s start with our strategy.", "Our direction has been consistent. We are making progress in some areas, but we know we can and should do better in other areas. Our direction is unchanged. We are making several shifts in the way that we execute against it. ", "First, we have taken steps to create much greater focus in our Services business. We completed the divestiture of our ITO business enabling a clear focus on the BPO and document outsourcing businesses. Last Friday, we announced a major change in our government healthcare strategy. We are focused on ensuring the success of the existing health enterprise implementations by limiting new pursuits with this platform. ", "Second, we are modifying our acquisition expectations for the year setting an achievable spend level given our progress to date. Third, the Services leadership team is in place with our last industry leader appointed in April. Our capabilities are fully staffed and sales resources are in place to market our full portfolio of services. Collectively, these actions result in a sharpened focus on achieving organic improvements in our Services business. We have also announced changes to our 2015 capital allocation plan. For the full year, we will increase our share repurchase by $300 million to $1.3 billion and we will return $300 million to shareholders in dividends unchanged.", "In summary, we have the right business strategy, we are reprioritizing investments, and accelerating our restructuring actions and services to improve revenue and margin. While we have more work to do, we are making decisions and changes that will deliver attractive return to our investors.", "Now, let\u2019s look at quarter two. We delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.22, that\u2019s in line with our guidance, which excludes the previously announced healthcare software impairment charges of $0.08. Total revenue was $4.6 billion, which is down 3% in constant currency. We grew Services revenue modestly in constant currency. It was driven by strong performance in document outsourcing and we delivered on our Services margin guidance. There are a few highlights in Services that I\u2019d like to share.", "We are seeing indications that our new Services go-to-market model is taking root. Our opportunity pipeline is up sequentially, and we are seeing more cross selling and better customer engagement. We made some important strides in innovation, introducing new levels of robotic automation to support our BPO offerings. For example, we recently announced ClearSight Automated Intelligence and ClearSight Case Management. We also introduced Managed Print Services innovation with the next generation offerings and workflow automation solutions to reinforce our leadership in the industry. And for internal productivity, we are driving transformational change in our own capability operations with the call center of the future program.", "Now moving on to Document Technology, revenue was down 7% in constant currency which is modestly lower than what we had expected. Including DO though, total document related revenues were down 4% in constant currency. That\u2019s consistent with the trend that we\u2019ve seen over the last several quarters. Document Technology margins were in line with expectations.", "Here is some highlights on Doc Tech. We retained our number one position in the equipment sales revenue market share for the twenty second straight quarter. We were pleased with in store performance in the quarter as most product segments improved, especially in the high end of our business. The new product introductions during the quarter and the launch of the iGen 5 earlier this month will enable us to continue in our leader position.", "Finally, we used our strong free cash flow $349 million in the quarter to acquire Health Communities Institute and Conestoga Business Solutions, and we repurchased shares in support of our dividend program.", "Now, I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy to go over some details on the quarter. I\u2019ll be back later to wrap things up. Kathy?", "Kathy Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. Our bottom line results were within our guidance for the quarter with Services profit in line, Tech profits a little light on modestly softer revenue which was offset by a bit better non-operating expenses. I will cover the segments in more detail in a minute, but first I will run through total company results for the second quarter.", "Total revenue in the quarter was down 7% at actual currency and 3% at constant currency. Growth in services was more than offset by declines in Document Technology which accelerated modestly driven by continued weakness in developing market and higher declines in supply revenue. The negative currency impact of 4 points on our top line was consistent with our expectations and with first quarter results.", "Gross margin of 31.1% was down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by lower technology gross margin as well as a greater mix of services which carries a lower margin. RD&E was slightly lower year-over-year, and SAG in absolute dollar terms was down 6% helped by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 30 basis points year-over-year to 19.7% as productivity benefits were more than offset by investments and services. As a result, our second quarter operating margin decreased 160 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 22%. About a quarter of the operating profit decline was driven by currency and developing markets with the remainder of the decline coming from the cross sells that I just discussed.", "Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $26 million lower year-over-year driven by lower restructuring cost. Equity income was $29 million in the quarter, down $4 million year-over-year driven by the continued impact of negative translation currency. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.8% was in the middle of our guidance and about a point lower year-over-year. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share was in the middle of our guidance range at $0.22. GAAP EPS from continuing operations in the quarter was $0.09 and includes the $0.08 impact from the government healthcare software impairment we announced last week, which was driven by the strategy change that Ursula already discussed. As this was a very large non-cash charge, we excluded it from our adjusted results to better reflect underlying operating performance.", "I will now move on to discuss our operating performance and services. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% in constant currency, which was consistent with the first quarter and a bit better than our guidance of roughly flat, driven by 4% growth in document outsourcing. Growth in document outsourcing reflects continued strong Xerox Partner print services growth, as well as good equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts from recent strong signings.", "BPO revenue was down 1%, reflecting the continued headwind from last year's larger contract losses, more than offsetting lower new ramp from softer signings in previous quarters. We continue to expect EPO growth to improve in the second half as we lap the larger contract losses. We completed two small acquisitions in the first half, and M&A remains a variable factor. I\u2019ll talk about this more when I cover cash flow and capital allocation.", "Total signings in the quarter were up 20%, and new business signings were up 9%, driven by strong signings and document outsourcing, as well as the recently signed New York Medicaid processing contract in BPO. We expect our go to market investments and move to industry alignment will yield improved new business signings growth as we progress through the year.", "Our pipeline continues to build and is up sequentially. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was below our target range of 85% to 90% and reflected in part lower renewal opportunities in the quarter. Year-to-date renewal rate is 87%.", "Turning to margin, segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 100 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. As expected, margin was pressured by higher cost related to our health enterprise platform implementation. As we acknowledge last quarter, costs are continuing to run high and we have more work to do to turnaround financial performance in these accounts.", "Additionally, investments in our new services operating model are not yet being fully offset by enhanced productivity from our operational initiatives, which are still ramping up. Partially offsetting these impacts was continued good margin in document outsourcing albeit lower year-over-year as expected and a year-over-year compare benefit related to the charge last year from the lost Nevada HIX business.", "So in summary the quarter was in line for services. We have made significant changes over the past year to move our services business forward and will be taking additional restructuring actions to ensure our productivity ramps up faster throughout the second half. I\u2019ll discuss this more when we get to guidance.", "I\u2019ll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was 7% at constant currency. As expected currency had a five point negative in point impact with revenue at actual currency down 12%. As we highlighted last quarter, we don't include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, but if we had revenue would have been down 6% at constant currency. So overall, revenue trends remained fairly stable.", "Looking at the details, equipment revenue declines moderated, down 6% to constant currency in the second quarter versus down 8% in the first quarter and 10% in the fourth quarter. The improving trend reflects benefits for recent new product launches, especially within high-end where equipment revenue grew in the quarter.", "Offsetting the positive equipment trend, were higher declines in supplies revenues driven in part by developing market, which were pressured by softening economies and currency. From an activity perspective, we saw improvements in growth in mid-range high-end and higher volume entry products. So overall, positive growth in installs across our product segments.", "Document Technology margin of 12.1% was down year-over-year, but up sequentially and in the middle of our 11% to 13% range for 2015. Year-over-year drivers included the anticipated higher pension expense and negative mix associated with improved equipment sales at lower margin. These were partially offset by a retiree health curtailment gain.", "So in closing, revenues were a little lighter than expected, but overall a reasonable quarter for technology with equipment trends and high end performance being positive takeaways. ", "Turning to cash flow, cash flow from operations was $349 million in the quarter, above last year's cash flow of $325 million. This reflects good overall performance despite weaker process as working capital was a lower net use versus last year, driven by the following factors. Accounts receivable was a source of $56 million in the quarter versus the use last year, reflecting lower revenues and flat year-over-year DSO. Accounts payable on accrued compensation was $75 million lower yield this year, reflecting timing of supplier payments. This was partially offset by a little higher inventory due to timing of shipments. ", "Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were an $831 million source driven by proceeds of $930 million from the sale of ITO business. This was partially offset by $102 million spent on Capex and $20 million on acquisitions. Cash flow from financing was a $422 million yield, which included $395 million spent on share repurchases and $83 million used for preferred and common stock dividend. As well it reflects an increase in commercial paper, offset by payments of $250 million on senior notes.", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.6 billion, an increase of $769 million, since the end of first quarter, driven by the proceeds received on June 30 from the ITO divestiture. So, cash flow is strong and continues to attract our expectations.", "Now, I\u2019ll quickly go over capital structure. We ended the second quarter with $7.6 billion in debt, applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets. Our allocated financing debt at the end of the second quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We managed our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade rating.", "Our capital structure remained fairly stable, if we move to the next slide, I\u2019ll review where we are in terms of capital allocation. Through the first half, we have repurchased $611 million in shares, spent $147 million on common stock dividend and $48 million on acquisitions. Considering our first-half performance and the opportunities we see for the balance of the year, we\u2019re adjusting our capital allocation plan.", "On acquisitions, we have spent about $50 million year-to-date. We now expect to spend between $100 million and $400 million for the full year. The bar is higher as we focus on organic improvements and services for the next few quarters. We are working to enhance our proactive business development capabilities and recently hired a new leader for business development and M&A. On share repurchase, we are increasing our full-year plan by $300 million to $1.3 billion. This reflects our view that our shares are attractively priced and a good investment, as well as our reduced near-term plans for acquisition. This leaves approximately $200 million unallocated that we will deploy opportunistically.", "On debt, we retired our last tranche of debt coming due this year $250 million in June and we continue to expect to end the year at a debt balance of roughly $7.7 billion. And finally on dividends, we continue to expect to spend just over $300 million. I\u2019ll now turn to a discussion of guidance.", "First, starting with revenue, Document Technology trends are stable as expected improvements in high-end and financing have been offset by ongoing weakness in developing markets from softening economies as well as from currency. As a result, we are planning for Document Technology revenue to be down roughly 6% at constant currency in the second half and for the full year. Additionally, we are spending less on acquisitions than originally planned dampening back Services revenue acceleration. At the total company level, we now anticipate full year revenue at constant currency will be down approximately 2%, consistent with prior year and down 1 point from what we last communicated.", "Turning to margin, we expect services margin will be at the low end of 8.5% to 9% for the year. With our margin at 7.5% for the first half, we need to average about 9.5% in the second half of the year to hit that level. This requires a step function change given the continued higher health enterprise implementation cost and margins not yet improving in the business as a whole outside of health enterprise.", "While our productivity initiatives are beginning to ramp, we need to further accelerate that to drive the second half improvement. In addition to capturing attrition benefit, we are planning a restructuring initiative which combined will reduce headcount by approximately 3,000 people. We expect modest sequential Services margin improvement in the third quarter with the fourth quarter clearly showing greater benefit given the timing of additional workforce actions and accelerating yield from our operating model changes. Seasonality in document outsourcing also aid sequential improvement in the fourth quarter.", "For Document Technology, we continue to expect margins between 11% to 13% for the full year in part supported by pension expense coming in lower than originally anticipated. In the first half, restructuring actions were focused on technology. In contrast, our second-half actions will be focused on Services. As a result, we expect relatively low restructuring cost due to natural attrition and relatively low average severance cost in Services.", "So in summary, we now expect to be at the lower end of $0.95 to $1.01 adjusted earnings per share range. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.22 and $0.24 reflecting normal seasonality and approximately $0.01 of restructuring. As I indicated earlier, operating cash flow was strong in the first half and we still expect to be within $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion range despite the lower earnings, reflecting both good working capital performance and lower restructuring cost.", "We are committed to getting the needed actions to improve profitability and meet our 2015 earnings and cash flow guidance, and we are confident that we have the right plan in place to deliver that and create value for our shareholders.", "With that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Kathy. And for the second quarter, as Kathy said, we largely met expectations. We are committed to delivering our guidance and we are doing everything that we can to overachieve. In Services, we are accelerating cost reduction actions and re-prioritizing investments in the second half to position the business for stronger financial performance while investing in the parts of the business that are critical to drive productivity and future growth.", "In Document Technology, we are focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market and on delivering strong financial performance. So in short, it\u2019s all about focus at Xerox. In addition to leading in the attractive document market, we are focused on making portfolio moves that strengthen our business financially and strategically. We are focused on optimizing our new Services operating model [indiscernible] productivity improvements across the business, and we are focused on driving revenue and profit growth in every line of business. And most importantly, we are focused on our people and on our clients. We remain committed to our business strategy and we are bullish about the markets that we serve and opportunities that lie ahead.", "Thank you, and now let me turn it over to Leslie.", "Leslie Varon", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I\u2019ll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.", "Karen, you can please now open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George Tong", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. First question for Kathy, in your margin performance guidance for Services that\u2019s been updated, can you detail what you are assuming for margin performance outside of government healthcare and what investments into government healthcare you are assuming in the second half?", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. If you look at what I discussed in terms of the overall progression in Services margin in the second half, it\u2019s very clear that outside of the health enterprise accounts what we are expecting is ramping productivity between the third and the fourth quarter to basically accelerate our margin improvement over the second half. The other thing that\u2019s really important to recall is that document outsourcing is a meaningful part of our Services business and as a percent of our Services business got larger when we divested the ITO business, and that has a natural seasonal pattern in the second half of the year where margins decline in the third quarter and then accelerate sequentially in the fourth quarter. So those are some of the important puts and takes in terms of the acceleration in the back half of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross", "Thank you very much. I had a couple of Services questions as well. First, can you talk a bit more about details on the restructuring program, and specifically what I\u2019m wondering is, what has changed in how you\u2019re looking at the restructuring from last quarter to this quarter?", "Robert Zapfel", "Shannon, it\u2019s Bob, so a couple of things. First is, as it was mentioned, heavily focused on Services rather than Doc Tech where we get kind of visibly more yield for restructuring dollars spent. And then inside our Services restructuring, a combination of what I would call G&A part of \u2013 now that we\u2019ve got our arms around managing the set of people and our capabilities organization, but a combination of that and then not needing to backfill and being able to take out a higher proportion of our delivery resources as a result of automation investments that we\u2019ve been making during the year and as a result of really having improved the service level quality where we are confident. We were trying to be a little bit careful to not go too quickly relative to optimizing our cost base without being sure that we could maintain and continue to increase delivery quality. So those would be the main summary points.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question \u2013 I\u2019m sorry.", "Leslie Varon", "I was just asking Shannon if she had a follow-up because she mentioned she had a couple of questions.", "Operator", "Shannon, your line is open.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay. Thank you. My only follow-up is just, can you talk a little bit about \u2013 you started to retrain and realign the sales force on the Services side. So I\u2019m curious as to what you\u2019re seeing in terms of any benefit from that or how that\u2019s progressing?", "Robert Zapfel", "Yes. We\u2019ve largely completed the addition of resources in our sales teams and we\u2019ve got good sequential pipeline improvement. So besides the fact that as it was mentioned before our signings were strong in the quarter, we\u2019ve seen our pipeline build out and we are also seeing which was part of the design of the new model going to market by industry, we are seeing a visible increase in the number of opportunities where we\u2019re bringing more than one offering to the customer so that it is leveraging Xerox services broadly rather than an isolated offering by itself. So those would be the primary points.", "Shannon Cross", "Thank you.", "Leslie Varon", "Karen, I think we can move on to the next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith Bachman", "Hi. Thank you. I have two as well. On the M&A pipeline, I understand completely that you want to focus on righting the ship. But if I think about over the last year and the year and a half, it seems like Xerox hasn\u2019t been able to hit, identify targets associated with M&A in the services area, and in contrast it seems like I get an email a week from Accenture about adding deals or completing deals, I\u2019m wondering is this more Xerox threshold, is it the pipeline, is it supply demand and balance, what has been the challenge associated with adding services revenue through inorganic means and then I have a follow-up?", "Ursula Burns", "Okay, Keith. I\u2019m going to start with, the way we have historically talked about this, we tended to say in up to numbers. So as an example when we started the year we said M&A up to $900 million and in fact we knew that was kind of quite a big number for us, especially relative to what we had typically been doing in the past, and so we also said at the same time that we expect that we might role some that over until next year. You know I'd note in the recent guidance we just gave we are giving a range because it seems like when we said up to, if we didn't hit the top end of that number, you know people really deemed us for falling short, when M&A is a little difficult to call. If I go to what we need to do to actually get more done, I\u2019d say the core thing we need to do is improve our hit rate, and the changes that we\u2019re looking to make is to pivot more of our activity to a proactive approach rather than just looking at deals that are being brokered in the market. That isn't something that happens overnight; I mentioned that we hired a new leader recently in order to head up that business. And in the meantime, we\u2019re also clearly looking to hold the bar a little higher as we focus over the next couple of quarters on really getting our organic improvements in services accelerating.", "Robert Zapfel", "If I can just add something, we are clearly part of four models to sell-out capabilities and broaden our reach particularly internationally, we need M&A and so we're not pleased with the fact that we are at the low end of our performance ranges here, but I also think it\u2019s a kind of a fortuitous time in the back half of the year to be focused on organic growth we have all of the infrastructure in place, we\u2019ve hired the capability leaders, we have the sales force full, we have the line of business guys all in place, we have a good start to operating model and focus here is an important thing. I don't want anyone to believe that we're walking away from M&A that we're not going to do it, but based on the reality of where we are I think we're going to be in this $100 million to $400 million range, we're going to spend the last half of the year trying to get that done; and then making sure that we have a foundation, a strong foundation, a kind of unshakable foundation in organic side of the business. So, I know it is not what we want to end up, but it is where we are.", "Keith Bachman", "Well thank you. That\u2019s certainly the right thing to do, just try to focus on the execution. I think totally appropriate. And my follow-up question though is on the printing side of the business. It does seem like there are some challenges there and I was wondering if you could add color in particular the supply side seems a bit weaker than I would have anticipated and it seems to be a lingering problem and is that just demand or is there a share or is there, how is the technology business seem to be facing incremental challenges, particularly on supplies? Thank you.", "Kathy Mikells", "And so specifically on supplies, I\u2019m going to first kind of refer back to my commentary when I talked about developing markets and the fact that we don't adjust currency out, right, so when we look at these numbers and publish these numbers it has developing markets at actual currency. If you make that adjustment in tag for supply, it actually moves the number by about two points and that will be the case for the last couple of quarters that currencies in developing markets have really been under pressure. So, I think if you look at it that way, I would say overall supply ebb and flow a little bit, but we don't see any kind of monumental shifts going on, here we think the business is pretty stable.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay thank you.", "Robert Zapfel", "One other thing to add Keith if I can is that our supplies mix is a little different than what some of our peers or competitors are as well, so smaller portion of our business, most of our supplies have bundled in contracts and what we\u2019re talking about here is supplies outside of that and it\u2019s a lower portion by and large of our business that's one. And the other thing about supplies is that Kathy talked about the currency impact, but it is, is an extra outside of the currency. DMO is just a basket of uncertainty there, we managed very tightly, we try to get inventory levels lined, everything has to be managed pretty tightly by us there, so we don't get too far over skies. I think fundamentally, we don't see massive changes in the marketplace, particularly when you look at currency, but we do pay a lot of attention to it and also remember that's a small part of a business than some of our competitors.", "Keith Bachman", "Alright, fair enough. I will see the forum, many thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "Thanks Keith.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you very much. My question is regarding the turnaround of operating services, if I do the math correctly, unless I'm mistaking, it looks like calendar Q4 will have operating margins 10% or above, is my math right and if so can you help us with your confidence and conviction there because it was literally at your Investor Day where Bob literally, we asked you, does he bluff these numbers, he has been at the company now for nine months and looked at the contracts and kicked the tires and toured, and he said yes and then we had a takedown as this year has progressed in this area, so you help us understand and do you actually have the visibility to kind of put your name behind it all as it has been a challenging area? And then my follow-up question is more or probably for Kathy on the cash flow side, varying cash flow held up despite all the stumblings and challenges they actually had this year in the takedown of lots of different things from revenues to margins to M&A, now that not coming through. So, are there things that are helping out cash flow one time this year, whether it is pension or reversals or something that we should be aware that are not sustainable. And the reason why as you know, numbers have perpetually been coming down lower, but cash flow has held up, I just want to know if that cash flow is still protected as we look forward long term in the model? Thank you.", "Robert Zapfel", "So Jim it\u2019s about our start. So, first your math is accurate. So that for us to deliver the commitments we've made we would expect to drive a two-digit number in the fourth quarter and I guess what I would go back to is we\u2019ve got a broad set of actions that drive that, you know if you will, hockey stick of improvement they start with the productivity that we talked about earlier and restructuring and taking costs out of our delivery model in cost base, it also includes a lower level of losses at our, in our health enterprise for portfolio, we think we've got sufficient contingencies for the unpredictability that we would see their, but that is part of our design model. I talked about the restructuring beyond delivery. ", "We've got continued strong profitability in our document outsourcing business and it's got a seasonality that's heavier in the second half in terms of profit yield than the first half and then we are really committed to driving improved revenue dynamics. So we've been pretty visible all along that we thought that we would be at the lower end of the 2% to 4% revenue range, we've run at one for the first half of the year. So, mathematically we'd obviously have to get to 3% in the second half. We've got headwinds that dissipate relative to Texas and student loans. We've got New York ramping. On the other side of it, we will have less in the way of a inorganic revenue growth, but the combination of factors would get us to improve revenue dynamics in the second half and then that profit increase, it's part of for model. So, Kathy do you want to address cash flow or provide more color on.", "Kathy Mikells", "I\u2019ll go to cash flow. On cash flow, I\u2019d start with as you mentioned, our cash flow has really been strong for the first half of the year and we\u2019re very comfortable with where our guidance is. If you look at some of the charges that we've taken this year, especially in health enterprise, outside of the recent impairment charge which is obviously non-cash, some of those charges are just spread over the contract period where we are doing the health enterprise implementations and so while they have some case impact in the current year, the cash impact is really spread over a multiple year period. As we see declines in our technology business that actually throws off a reduction in working capital until we get a natural benefit there as well as actually just managing our working capital really well. And then finally the lower segment results are in part offset with a little lower restructuring. So as we look out to the back half based on where we\u2019ve been tracking year-to-date this year, we feel very comfortable about where we are at in meeting our guidance.", "Leslie Varon", "Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.", "Matt Cabral", "Yeah. Thank you. This is Matt Cabral in for Bill. So I wanted to better understand the thought process behind the announcement last week to limit health enterprise to the six states you currently have under contract. Was there anything that changed last quarter to necessitate this change? Are there any additional challenges that you see in ramping those four states that are up and running yet. There may be one is clear, three six once a ago and then related to that, just thinking to the longer term revenue target that you guys gave for the Services business, how much of that was predicated on extending health enterprise into additional states beyond the six that you currently have?", "Ursula Burns", "So, the decision to \u2013 I\u2019m going to have Bob follow-up from with the detail but I\u2019m going to start out with the top level decision. And the decision that we announced last Friday was one that was a fundamental strategic change and the change was not that we didn\u2019t want to be in health enterprise. We just want to get what we wanted \u2013 what we had underway kind of embedded down and tightly focused. We have big states, New York and California, New York just starting, California kind of in the middle of its journey and what I ask the Services team to do is to actually focus on those big implementations. The six states that we have, let\u2019s make sure we get those settle down and then we\u2019ll start to pursue to market again in the future if we think it\u2019s actually useful. So I\u2019m actually then have Bob get into the details of what we see in the states.", "Robert Zapfel", "Yes. I would just add that as Ursula shared, we are really trying to focus on success in those existing clients and we\u2019ve got the biggest states reference less to really deliver on long term to grow, the best way to grow is to have every customer completely satisfied. So we felt like our delivery capacity, you got to remember, New York really was just one at this point in the last conference call. And as we looked at how much capacity we had, the work to do in California, New York, Montana kind of across the remaining portfolio, we felt that we would be better served to center our resources there. There aren\u2019t that many new bids that come up. It\u2019s not something where all 50 states are rebidding every year. We have D.C. has a long shelf life, so we felt that we would be better both short term and long term to deliver world-class service and platforms with these accounts and then reassess after that\u2019s done whether we would pursue more opportunities in the marketplace.", "Ursula Burns", "In long term revenue dynamics, we do understand that we will have some backend pressure \u2013 backend meaning out year pressure. But as Bob said, the big thing here is that getting these six states done, we found historically that additional business comes if you operate really well. The quicker we can get them done and the quicker we can get them in line, I think that we can actually balance the revenue and the out years. That would be pressured if we didn\u2019t actually pursue. So I don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to have significant issues in the out years due to this decision.", "Robert Zapfel", "And we\u2019ll have \u2013 just to reinforce, we will have visible growth year next year as we ramp New York. So this portfolio of accounts is not going to be a low growth business for us in the short term, but it is a longer term question that we think we can manage.", "Matt Cabral", "Thank you.", "Leslie Varon", "Thanks, Matt. Karen, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Essex", "Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you could start off, first of all, just revisiting the New York contract and maybe Bob you just mentioned and you\u2019re ramping in the next year, obviously we\u2019ve known for quite some time that you had this contract and you\u2019ve been pre-spending so to speak. May be help me understand or help us understand how you expect the trajectory of ramp for the benefits of that contract to be realized by the company. And then with this kind of 18 month implementation timeline, when did that clock start ticking? Are you well ahead of that or how do we think about hitting those goalpost and leveraging. You are now I guess fundamentally complete software development program and how you can gain confidence so you can hit that timeframe.", "Robert Zapfel", "Okay. Let me start, if I can Brian with kind of the delivery plan with New York, so there are two major release milepost, one is that the first quarter of next year and the second is that the fourth quarter of 2016, those set of deliverables along the way and we are on track across those deliverables. And the reason or might not the only reason but a reason that will after a good start as you referenced is we invested ahead. So we took the financial hit little bit in the fourth quarter and the first quarter from investing ahead. And our initial concept sessions with the state where we confirm designs have been very collaborative all going well. So at this point we are tracking well and as you may remember, New York is basically leveraging the platform that we\u2019ve built for New Hampshire which was just certified by CMS back in June. So it\u2019s now federally certified as a good platform. Relative to ramp on the reverence, Kathy do you want to cover that?", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. We just started the contract in the second quarter and so it\u2019s going to be ramping through the rest of the year. We should exit the year with New York just under a point in terms of kind of revenue growth for overall services.", "Brian Essex", "Okay, great. And then maybe if I could follow-on the obligatory question on the Florida Toll road contract, any update there in terms of progression or what you might expect in terms of the timeline?", "Ursula Burns", "Yeah. I\u2019m going to take this one. We don\u2019t have an update is what we would expect and the one reason why is that we aren\u2019t predicting this. We have won the bid and we\u2019ve won the bid again. So we won the bid, it\u2019s not a question, but we now have an additional protest that\u2019s going to go through its cycle and when it\u2019s done, we\u2019ll get the business. We\u2019re not going to predict when that protest is going to be done because every time we seem to say something it delays. So it\u2019s going to impact.", "Robert Zapfel", "But we do think this is the last remaining potential protestee. So hopefully this is the last part of the cycle.", "Brian Essex", "Okay, very helpful.", "Leslie Varon", "Thanks, Brian. Karen, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hi. Thanks, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I have two if I could as well. I guess the first is there seem to be a revenue component to the second half guide down with BMO and there seems to be Services margin component as well, maybe they got down for the second half of the year was a couple of penny. So the question is, what kind of tail should we expect these to have, the two dynamics to have as we think about going into \u201916. And to the extent that they do extend into \u201916, could you make it up anywhere and if not should we feel when we start to think about \u201916. I realize you\u2019re not going to give guidance. But if there is sort of like a $0.02 tail, $0.02 impact of these things in the second half of the year, should we think about having some kind of impact as we move into next year, and then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "So the overall revenue dynamics that we are seeing really intact are stable and we have been expecting to see truck improve a little bit as a result of our execution in areas of growth. So while we are seeing good execution in a place like high end, it\u2019s being offset by developing market and not stabilizing but continuing to be a little bit soft both from soft economies in developing markets and from currency. I mentioned the fact that we don\u2019t adjust out developing markets for constant currency basis and so that kind of heightened the decline for us a little bit.", "On Services, really the only change there is the fact that we are a little light on M&A and so that will make us a tad bit lighter in terms of just trying to accelerate growth in the back half. But it\u2019s important to understand the same way that the Services segment margin kind of ramps over the course of the back half. We have a very similar dynamic going on in revenue in large part because we\u2019re going to start to lack some big contract boxes. So you recall the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract, if we look at first half over second half that\u2019s worse about 2 points to us. So between that and New York we have quite good I say organic revenue growth dynamics naturally from half to half and throughout the second half of the year.", "Robert Zapfel", "Ananda, I would just say I know that we are guiding to the lower end of the range but I want to make sure that we understand that we are still in the range and we\u2019re going to try to do everything we can to overachieve that. But it\u2019s important \u2013 we are trying to hold ourselves to the commitment in the range that we have in both Services margin and in total EPS.", "Ananda Baruah", "And then hopefully the new restructuring actions, as the new wins that you have in search is going to actually scale up into the cost structure and help the revenue and the margins there as well. So those are both good tick up. And I guess as my follow-up just touching based on M&A again, as it was touched on earlier in the Q&A spend, maybe the third year where you\u2019ve been a little bit on the softer side of the target. My question is, at what point you guys start get a little vary of what\u2019s the longer term top line impact of these to the model, and you guys thinking of it in that context yet.", "Kathy Mikells", "So I think the things that we are doing to I\u2019d say change our approach and execution in M&A or what we need to do that actually get this engine moving for us more consistently and that\u2019s really pivoting from being opportunistic largely a pipeline of brokers deals to M&A and business development activity. That\u2019s led by our strategic planning and that strategic planning really yielding a team focused on where we have gaps in our portfolio and a proactive M&A activity where we proactively build our pipeline. That shift in overall approach, not a shift in strategy for what we are trying to accomplish through M&A but shift in the execution approach should help us to improve our hit rate. And if I had to kind of point to one soft under valley in M&A, it\u2019s that with a large part of our pipeline coming through broker deals. Our hit rate is not as high as we would desire it to be. So we are taking actions in order to change our overall approach so that we can be both very focused, right, and improve our hit rate.", "Leslie Varon", "Okay. Thank you, Karen. Next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Great. Thanks. Good morning. I\u2019ll ask a derivate M&A question. I\u2019m curious as all these healthcare consolidation especially on the healthcare payers basis, does that have any impact to Xerox in your overall healthcare business.", "Robert Zapfel", "We are fortunate that we are providers to all of the players that are participating in the consolidation dynamics and my business experience is if you\u2019ve got the acquiree as a client, that\u2019s not a good place to be. When you have both the acquirer and the acquiree, you\u2019re better positioned. So I would expect and we don\u2019t do the exact same work with each side if you will and some of the big visibly announced planned mergers. So I think for us, there is always the chance that you\u2019re going to get \u2013 you\u2019re going to be part of the synergy savings play and help those lead customers achieve their synergy savings. We think we were well positioned to participate in that because we are on both sides of visible transactions. We have very strong client referenceability and we tend to see the clients wanting to consolidate and leverage providers where they would be more likely even use us more broadly.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Got it. Makes sense, Bob.", "Leslie Varon", "Thank you.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Can I ask?", "Leslie Varon", "Certainly, one more question.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "I\u2019m sorry, just a quick one. Just on the signings, thanks for letting me sneak one more in, just on the services signings front, I caught the Florida comment, obviously New York coming in, I\u2019m curious any other larger deals that could be building up in the pipeline because systematically it sounds like bigger deals are coming back for the sector including within BPO, I\u2019m curious if you are seeing that as well? Thank you, I\u2019ll drop off.", "Robert Zapfel", "We\u2019re not really seeing an increase in what I would call the big multi or a $100 million or $100 million plus deals, but what we are seeing is we are seeing visible improvement in our pipeline, including the progression, so not just the \u2013 you know how many deals do we have to pursue, but where are they in the sales stage that we need to then leverage to drive improved signings in the second half of the year. That\u2019s our plan. ", "Kathy Mikells", "Thank you. Next question Karen.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.", "Kulbinder Garcha", "Hi, both of my questions have been asked and maybe I missed...", "Kathy Mikells", "Can you speak up a little bit Kulbinder.", "Kulbinder Garcha", "Most of my questions have been asked, I just wanted to ask, have you given a number for the restructuring amount this year and what the normal level of restructuring going forward the company and then also what tax ratio you would be assuming? Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "So, I think, I am going to try and repeat the question just because I\u2019m not positive that I heard you, was your first question just asking about the level of restructuring generally?", "Kulbinder Garcha", "Correct.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yes. So, we have tended to do, I will call it about $0.02 a quarter or between $0.01 and $0.02 a quarter that ebbs and flows in different quarters as we look at and assess our business. We specifically guided to doing about $0.01 in the third quarter, you know and we will assess the fourth quarter as we get closer, but we do have an expectation that in the back half of the year generally our restructuring is going to be a little bit lighter. And I think your second question was overall kind of tax rate. We haven\u2019t changed our tax rate guidance. We expect to be between 25% and 27%.", "Leslie Varon", "Thank you. I think we have time just for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.", "Jamie Friedman", "Hi, thanks for sneaking me in lastly. There is a reference in the press release and sort of deep down there, but with regard to the new Hampshire contract and it states in there that Medicaid, I would just paraphrase them, Medicaid certified your retroactively to the April 2013 implementation date, I guess more generally, I was just \u2013 what the status of New Hampshire is, I understand it is launched and live, but what does that certification mean and is there any financial implication to the fact that it\u2019s retroactive?", "Robert Zapfel ", "Yes. There really aren\u2019t financial implications to the retro activity, but the certification really means for the other states that as they look at and work with us they [indiscernible] that platform not just that we are selling with its features, but that the feds and CMS agree that that\u2019s you know designed to meet the federal targets. Very good thing. A very good thing.", "Jamie Friedman", "That sounds like a positive. Thank you.", "Leslie Varon", "Great. Thanks, Jamie. So that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. So let\u2019s wrap up.", "Ursula Burns", "So, as I said earlier, the second quarter was in-line, but we expect more and we are looking to deliver more. We are making choices that increase our short-term performance while retaining the ability to achieve our long-term goals. We are focused on delivering better results and improving the performance of our business and I thank you all for joining us on the call.", "Leslie Varon ", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have any further questions, please contact me or any member of our investor relations team.", "Operator", "Thank you.

(NYSE:XRX)", "Q3 2006 Earnings Call", "October 23, 2006 10:00 am ET", "Executives", "Anne Mulcahy - Chairman, CEO ", "Lawrence Zimmerman - SVP, CFO ", "Analysts", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS Warburg ", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America ", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research  ", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation third quarter 2006 earnings release conference call, hosted by Anne Mulcahy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Lawrence Zimmerman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Ms. Mulcahy and Mr. Zimmerman will refer to slides, which are available on the Xerox investor website at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's meeting will be tape recorded. Taping and rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.", "After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) During this meeting, Ms. Mulcahy and Mr. Zimmerman will make comments that constitute forward-looking statements as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements reflect management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations, and actual results might differ materially from those projected in these statements.", "Information concerning factors that could cause such material differences is included in the Company's 2005 Form 10-K and second quarter 2006 Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. We do not undertake to update these forward-looking statements as a result of new information or future events or developments.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Mulcahy. Ms. Mulcahy, you may begin.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. If you'll turn to slide 4, you'll see a summary of our Q3 results. We delivered earnings per share of $0.54 and net income of $536 million. That's on a GAAP basis and includes a $0.45 benefit from finalizing a tax audit, partially offset by $0.07 from restructuring and $0.07 related to litigation matters. So, excluding these items, we're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.23, an increase of 28% from Q3 of last year and ahead of our expectations.", "We delivered steady improvements in revenue consistent with our growth strategy and trending positively. Total revenue up 2%. Post sale and financing revenue grew 3%. Color, which now represents 36% of total revenue, grew 16% in the quarter. In a bit, you'll hear me talk about the success of our new color products, key drivers of our continued leadership in this important market.", "Gross margins were 40.2% in the third quarter, down about a point. Larry will talk more about the margin dynamics this quarter, but in short, the decline was primarily due to product mix and equipment pricing. Margins were also lower in Global Services, as we incurred upfront costs to support new multi-year contracts. We did see this issue during the quarter and responded to it by capturing efficiencies in SAG and R&D. As a result, we still delivered on our earnings expectations, while making the necessary investments in pricing and ramping up significant services contracts.", "With that, selling, administrative and general expenses declined 1.3 points in the quarter. The balance sheet remains solid; we generated $530 million in cash from operations in Q3 and are at $897 million year-to-date. Our cash and short-term investments are $1.5 billion. That gives us flexibility to continue moving ahead with our acquisition strategy. We closed on the Amici acquisition in Q3 and announced our plans to purchase the variable information software company, XMPie. We've repurchased $1.1 billion in Xerox stocks since launching the program a year ago. So solid momentum on several fronts.", "I'll provide more detail on the revenue picture, then Larry will discuss the financials, and then I'll be back to wrap up and we'll both take your questions.", "So, if you'd like to turn to slide 5, you'll see a look at our revenue trends, noting the year-over-year compare in actual and constant currency. Currency did turn favorable this quarter, adding a 1 point benefit. Total revenue in the quarter was up 2%, largely due to the 3% increase in post-sale revenue, which represents about 75% of total revenues.", "The leading indicators of our growth strategy continue to trend positively. We're boosting our annuity stream through growth in Digital, Services and Color. Post-sale from Digital was up 4%; Color post-sale was up 16%. And document management wins increased post-sale from Services by 7%.The decline from our legacy Light Lens business cost 2 points on post-sale, and without the impact of Light Lens, which was about $78 million, post-sale would have grown 5% in the quarter. ", "The revenue dynamics continue to shift as expected, with equipment sales providing less leverage, as the more profitable annuities stream kicks in from Color and our Services-led enterprise wins. Equipment sale revenue was down 1%; three factors came into play here:", "First, declines in high-end black & white production were only partially offset by stronger sales of light production and production color devices. ", "Two, as expected, we continue to make pricing investments, especially in the office, that have an impact on equipment sale revenue, but also serve to drive activity growth. This dynamics played out in DMO as well, with significant sales of Segments 1 and 2 office products that deliver more leverage on post sale than on equipment revenue.", "Three, as we shift to more office services deals, the install activity associated with these deals are recognized as operating leases and not as equipment sales so we don't get the immediate benefit in the equipment sales revenue line, but it flows through to post-sale. That is why install activity remained such an important measure for us, and indeed, remained strong for several key markets. ", "We launched 11 products through the third quarter, and last week announced enhanced features to our production and office systems. This innovation is driving accelerated activity, especially for our WorkCentre multifunction devices and our production color system. We continue to generate more than two-thirds of our equipment sales from products launched in the past two years.", "So now, if you'll turn to slide 6, we will take a look at activity. This slide represents year-to-date install trends. When I review the business segment, you'll see the quarterly install numbers. In the office, we're seeing a strong pickup in color, with MFDs up 34%. Installs of office black & white increased 7%. The majority of the activity is driven by growth in Segments 3 through 5, which generate more pages than desktop units and yield a greater return in post sale.", "Installs of high-end production systems are down 16%. Some of that activity is shifting to color. Even more of it is moving to mid and light production markets, with 19% growth in light production. We're quite pleased with the progress we're seeing with Nuvera, steady improvement in sales since launching the advanced features earlier this year. You'll see here that color install growth is off the charts at 99%. That is due to strong growth in iGen activity and the DocuColor series.", "So now, turn to slide 7 and see how color played across the board. I always start this slide with a reminder that Xerox has the industry's broadest portfolio of color systems for production and office environments of any size, and of course the benefit is in the pages. Color pages were up 35% in the quarter and now represent 10% of Xerox's total pages. Considering the leverage that Color has on our annuity stream, this steady increase in pages is a leading indicator of future post-sale growth. About 36% of total revenue is from Color and nearly half of all equipment sales now come from Color products, with the Color equipment sales up 17% in the quarter.", "We've bolstered our Color line with five new systems this year alone, including expanding the iGen3, WorkCentre Color and DocuColor families, and adding new features that enhance image quality and productivity. In fact, we recently hit the 18,000 mark for the number of DocuColor placements, a milestone that certainly exceeds production Color installs of any competitor.", "We continue to see a slowdown in sales of desktop color printers, primarily in our OEM products, but Xerox-branded printers were stronger this quarter. Without the impact from color printers, our Color equipment revenue was actually up nearly 26% this quarter. Again, Color now represents 36% of total revenue, up 4 points from a year ago.", "So if you turn to slide 8, we will take a look at the production business. Total production revenue grew 3% including a 1 point benefit from currency. Q3 installs of production monochrome systems were down 6%. Sales of the 4110 light production system drove 5% activity growth in production black & white, partially offsetting declines in higher-end production monochrome.", "As I mentioned, Nuvera contributed stronger sales this quarter. Last week at Graph Expo, we announced new finishing options for the DocuTech highlight color system. We expect these advanced features will drive increased interest, especially from commercial printers who are breaking into digital book publishing. Strong activity in iGen3 and DocuColor fueled a 107% increase in production color installs. Now, we have 142 customers with multiple iGen3's generating millions of color pages each month.", "This is a good place to provide more detail on our acquisition of XMPie. One of the key benefits of digital printing is its ability to personalize each and every document that turns off the press. It has created new opportunities for direct marketing that are generating response rates more than double that of static documents. That is where XMPie comes in. As the leading provider of variable information software, XMPie enables multimedia campaigns with personalized e-mail, website and, of course, catalogs, brochures and other documents. ", "Since Xerox is a leader in digital printing and XMPie's largest reseller, it made perfect sense for us to capitalize on XMPie's projected growth by running it as a stand-alone business in Xerox. Response to the pairing of our two companies has been quite positive, and we expect the deal will close in the next couple of weeks.", "A quick note on Graph Expo. I was at the show last week, meeting with customers and partners who continue to demonstrate amazing progress in growing their businesses through digital printing. The show was a huge success for Xerox, highlighting the breadth of our products, workflow and services offerings and generating multi-million dollar orders, including multiple orders for iGen3's right from the show floor.", "So if you turn to slide 9, we will do a review of our office business. Total office revenue was flat in the third quarter, including a 2 point currency benefit. Revenue was impacted by pricing investments of 10%, the high end of the range we've talked about in the past. Again, our strategy in this space is to drive major placements of Segments 3 through 5 multifunction systems, which generate higher volumes of pages and fuel our annuity stream. Q3 activity is evidence that the strategy is working. Install growth in Segments 3 to 5 was up 19%. ", "The pace of growth in color printers, primarily from OEMs, did slow this quarter, with color printers down 6%. They did have a tough compare from an especially strong Q3 of last year. Installs of office color MFDs grew 46% in the quarter. These solid growth rates are largely driven by the new WorkCentre color systems launched in May and the continued success of the office version of the DocuColor 240 and 250.", "As I mentioned, as we ramp up for some of our big contracts, we're incurring upfront costs that do have an impact on margins. Larry is going to discuss this more in a bit. We're also working through longer lead times to finalize services-driven wins. As a result, signings for document management services were about flat in Q3, but are up 16% year-to-date. Those wins are flowing through to support our annuity stream, with post-sell revenue from Services up 7% in the quarter.", "Results in DMO continue to improve. So take a look at slide 10. Revenue was up 7%; equipment sales up 7%; and post-sale up 7%. We are continuing to see strong demand in DMO countries for our Segment 1 and 2 MFPs so we are expanding our channel offerings in this space, targeting the small- and medium-sized businesses with affordable, high-quality multifunction devices. At the same time, we're encouraged by increased install activity for production systems, specifically light production and production color. And DMO's operational improvements continue to expand its operating margins. So positive trends on all fronts in DMO.", "So now, I'm going to turn it over to Larry for the financial review, and I'll be back to wrap up and share what we expect for Q4. And then, of course, Larry and I will be pleased to take your questions. Larry?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Thank you, Ann, and good morning. Third quarter results accomplished our goals of growing annuity revenue, expanding earnings and generating solid operating cash flow. This performance, along with share repurchase and acquisitions, continues to bring value to our shareholders. The basic theme this quarter is consistent with past results. We installed significant volumes of equipment to drive future annuity. Equipment sales growth was impacted by mix of products, price and operating leases. We continue to see post-sale grow, driving total revenue growth.", "Gross margin was lower this quarter than our model; this was primarily due to equipment pricing and mix, as well as managed services, where we had large contract wins either starting up or scaling. Excellent expense management more than offset gross profit margin pressure. We expect this will continue as we restructure and balance our gross profit margin expectation, with a more efficient SAG and R&D going forward. Earnings growth, 28% on an adjusted basis, was driven by income before tax, a better tax rate and fewer shares outstanding. Finally, cash flow was quite positive, continuing to support our business model.", "So please turn to slide 12 to review progress on our post-sale business. Let's start at the bottom to see the benefits of Color growth, 16%, and Services growth of 7%. LightLens is still a 2% drag, but the dollars continue to get smaller and will have a smaller effect next year. With continued growth in digital and DMO, total post-sale grew 3%; that is 2% on a constant currency basis. We expect all of these positive trends to continue.", "Slide 13. The earnings chart is consistent with the format we use to distinguish adjusted items from the underlying business trends. It is also consistent with last year's third quarter data. The top part of the chart represents the underlying ongoing business results, 2% revenue growth driven by post-sale annuity. Gross profit margin of 40.2%, down 1.1 points from last year, driven by Equipment and Managed Services. Equipment is the result of mix and price investments to drive volume to support our annuity business.", "The margin impact from Managed Services is really the result of our success in winning large global services contracts. We add people and infrastructure to support the contracts, often prior to the buildup of revenue. The result is an initial impact on margin; however, as these contracts reach a steady state, the revenue generating from the deal helps to improve overall gross margin. This is the nature of the Services business as it scales, but like the operating lease impact on equipment sales, the initial upfront costs will support growth and profitability in the future.", "We demonstrated what we have said many times before: we focus on bottom-line results and adjust our model to compete and deliver. This quarter, SAG and RD&E were better year-over-year and more than offset the decline in gross profit margin. We reduced SAG $26 million and R&D by $12 million. We did so without reducing coverage or cutting our investments in innovation and important engineering. Instead, reductions came through general and administrative areas, where we continue to capture efficiencies in our value chain and improve our cost of competitiveness.", "In fact, our restructuring in the third and fourth quarters is aimed at adjusting our model to the current business environment, giving us even more flexibility to invest for future growth and expand earnings. We believe it is prudent to adjust our business model going forward to lower SAG and RD&E in order to comprehend the 40% to 41% gross profit margin. Again, we will not reduce coverage or product development, but will look at several opportunities to streamline our operations.", "We still believe there is opportunity to reduce cost of goods sold and improve gross profit margin, but for now, we thought it important to clarify the dynamics of our current business model, setting realistic expectations on how we will manage the business to continue expanding earnings, while competing effectively.", "GAAP earnings for the third quarter were $0.54 per share. Take a look at the boxed area of the chart to review the remaining elements of the P&L, other net, restructuring and tax rate. You'll recall the after-tax adjustments in the third quarter of '05 were: $26 million for EU waste directive and accounting changes; $88 million of litigation matters, principally the MPI arbitration panel ruling, which is still in appeal; and $11 million of restructuring. This year's after-tax adjustments are: a $68 million charge for probable loss on previously disclosed labor disputes in Brazil; tax audit settlement for the years 1999 through 2003, which we previously announced at a favorable $448 million; and $72 million of restructuring.", "The tax audit settlement was disclosed in our second quarter 10-Q filed on August 4th. At that time, we estimated after-tax restructuring in the second half of the year would be in the range of $125 million to $175 million. We now estimate about $200 million of after-tax restructuring in the second half; that would be about $130 million in the fourth quarter. Excluding these items, our adjusted net income is $228 million, up 21% year-over-year, and 28% on an adjusted EPS basis. Our adjusted tax rate was 26% for the quarter.", "So a quick summary. Significant adjusted net earnings growth of 21%; significant adjusted EPS growth of 28%; strong performance in cost and expense management; gross margin decline of 1.1 points, offset by SAG, RD&E improvement of 1.7 points; 40% to 41% gross profit margin expectation going forward.", "Slide 14. The cash story remains quite positive. We had core cash flow and total cash flow from operations of approximately $500 million, which was essentially driven by earnings. Year-to-date we're at $740 million of core cash and $897 million of total cash from operations, keeping us on track to meet the high end of the $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion range.", "Cash from investing included the closing of our acquisition of Amici, as well as CapEx. Cash from financing is driven by our unsecured debt offering of $650 million, $260 million reduction in secured debt, with another $250 million to $300 million expected to run off in the fourth quarter. Year-to-date, we have reduced secured debt by $1.2 billion and replaced it with unsecured debt at attractive rates to support our financing business.", "We have used $689 million in cash this year to repurchase approximately 47 million shares. Since launching the program a year ago, we've used $1.1 billion to repurchase approximately 78 million shares. At the end of September, 965 million common shares were outstanding.", "Slide 15. Our balance sheet and capital structure are meeting our goals, investing in our business and rewarding shareholders. As I've mentioned, cash flow is on track and has been consistent quarter after quarter and year after year. Healthy cash balance enables run off of secured debt and our share repurchase in the fourth quarter. Our financing business will remain leveraged at 7:1. The $1.25 billion credit facility and the investment-grade credit rating from Fitch give us optimistic opportunity in this area. Total secured debt was 32% of total debt versus 49% year at year end 2005, and getting lower. Essentially, we have no core debt.", "In addition to share repurchase, we've announced two strategic acquisitions and maintain a fully funded U.S. pension plan on a current liability basis, all positive results that position us well going forward.", "On that note, I'll end where I started. Our third quarter results demonstrated steady improvement, with revenue growth through annuity, expanded earnings and strong cash flow. Our strategies are yielding. And now back to Anne.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry. So here is a quick summary. We are pleased with our revenue and activity this quarter. Post-sale is up, leading with Digital, Color, Pages and Services, and strengthening an annuity stream that serves us well for the long term. Equipment installs in key markets, especially Color and Office Multifunction, remain strong. The 11 product launches this year alone plus advanced product features keep us on a steady pace for continued activity growth.", "Disciplined cost controls and a focus on capturing efficiencies across the value chain are helping us expand earnings and creating some headroom for further investments. Our business is always changing with the demands of the market and our business model needs to adapt as quickly. So as previously communicated, we will do more restructuring in Q4 and expect restructuring charges of about $0.13 per share. As Larry noted, our cash position is strong and we're investing it and areas to grow our business through acquisitions and to build shareholder value through stock buyback.", "So for Q4, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.34 to $0.37 per share, excluding the $0.13 of restructuring. This keeps us in line with delivering full year adjusted earnings of $1 to $1.07 and earnings expansion of greater than 10%.", "So thank you all for listening, and Larry and I will now be pleased to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. Anne, with respect to the gross margin outlook, what can you do more on improving your cost of goods? You're expending hundreds of millions of dollars a year, of course, with Fuji Xerox and Flex, plus other suppliers. What can you do, if anything, to help bring down those costs on a per-unit basis or by any other means in terms of improving the effectiveness of your supply chain, for example?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. I think maybe this is a good opportunity, Jay, to take you through a little bit of what we're focused on with our restructuring efforts, because a lot of it is focused on gross margin improvement. We do believe it's an opportunity. I think from a planning and expectation perspective, we thought it was prudent to plan for 40 to 41, but really look at the opportunity in front of us to improve gross margins by a very focused restructuring effort.", "So there are some things that we've done and that are in process. We've actually moved our production procurement to China, and we do believe that is going to yield some good results. We're continuing to have opportunity in our technical services infrastructure, and that will also be part of our restructuring actions in the second half.", "Global back office efficiencies, which are more SAG related, but clearly help us from an expense perspective, are certainly enabled by some of the things we're looking at, like some selective offshoring activities. We're real pleased that our R&D productivity continues to progress, and we think we can use some restructuring to enable some continued productivity in that area.", "You are right, supply chain optimization is a focus. As a matter of fact, we've had multiple pilots running throughout the world, testing some different supply chain efficiencies, particularly as it relates to two-tier distribution. So that as well will be a target and enabled by the restructuring. So it is across the board. I think we've really got an opportunity for continued value chain improvement. As I said, a lot of that is aimed at gross margin improvement. So that is opportunity for us going forward.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Similarly, what are you doing or what you do you need to do more on the sales and support side in terms of improving sales productivity, reorienting direct and indirect sales in any particular way, given the complexity of the product line now, and some of the new verticals that you seem to be targeting, as you did at Graph Expo last week?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. I think it's all about much more pinpointed and channel-specific strategies on the sales side. I mentioned that we're so pleased with the progress that has been made at DMO that were really using DMO to be an engine of growth, particularly for the SMB side. So both with new and expanded product offerings appropriate for the SMB market that certainly play in Europe and North America as well, but the huge opportunity is in the DMO market. So both from a product and a channel perspective, I think expansions there.", "Certainly we really are seeing opportunities to optimize our coverage in terms of the way we cover the marketplace from a major account and a services perspective that give us some efficiency, but actually improve our coverage and productivity. So we believe that as we continue to ramp up our services capabilities, particularly, that we can integrate some of those sales resources in front of the customer and really have good productivity impact.", "On the PSG side, the production side is all about verticals. I mean, more than any other company, we've invested, obviously, really aggressively in a graphic arts sales force, which I think is an enormous differentiator for the company. Now we're building expertise in a lot of areas. You saw at Graph Expo the focus on book publishing, which we think is one of the most exciting and emerging market opportunities for digital. So it's going to be all about applications and vertical penetration, which I think allows us to be efficient from a sales perspective, but really capitalize on the high-growth markets. ", "So all in all, we believe that our focus on these kinds of sales investments will be an opportunity in terms of growing the overall revenue base.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Lastly, just in terms of market trends, it was an interesting presentation last week by InfoTrends, the research firm, at Graph Expo, about where the pages are going to be coming from.", "On the one hand, they believe that there has been a large, proportionate increase in very short-run prints; in other words, 500 pages and less have become the faster growing part of the market, according to them.", "On the other hand, they also foresee a massive increase in large duty cycle prints, hundreds of thousands if not millions of pages a year, with the most rapid growth coming from high-speed inkjet rather than toner. So, how do you see yourselves being positioned for one or both of those?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think we would agree. Certainly, if you look at the entire production portfolio on the digital cut sheet side, I think it is benefiting from the growth in the short-run print-on-demand personalization trends that we see across the board, obviously with iGen and DocuColor. On the mono side, we're breathing life into mono with things like book publishing and highlight color, which allow for a lot of those short-run applications, like teachers' edition books, to be done so efficiently.", "On the very high end, I think there is a little bit of a bifurcation, and we certainly plan to participate in that as well, both through continuous feed and the product opportunities we have with as you know, the Fuji Xerox, Fujitsu continuous feed portfolio, which we are certainly very pleased about. As well as some of the technologies that we are bringing on market as well, from solid ink to also staying very open to other inkjet technologies that play well within the Xerox portfolio.", "So I don't think we're tied or biased, if you will, to any single technology; this is about the pages. We will continue to develop and exploit, if you will, the strength on the cut sheet side, and as well, do more as it relates to the high-end, high-volume kinds of applications in the large duty cycles as well.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS.", "Ben Reitzes - UBS Warburg", "Good morning. Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask about the restructuring, $0.13 in the fourth quarter. I think you said you'd continue to do restructurings on the last call but that one seems a little bigger. And I was wondering what kind of savings come to the bottom line from the restructurings and whether they end after this quarter?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay, so let me just remind you, when we actually put out the announcement on the tax refund, we did estimate about $125 million to $175 million restructuring on an after-tax basis. We are now looking at about $200 million, so slightly above, but not significantly out of range in terms of the outlook. That gets split with about $70 million or $72 million in Q3, and then another $130 million or so in Q4. So it is somewhat leveraged into the fourth quarter, strictly because of time reasons to really do the planning required.", "We do believe that this is really focused on the kinds of things that will position us well for the future in some of the things that I just ran through in terms of the impacts on improving gross margin, as well as the continuing focus on expense efficiencies make a lot of sense. This is, I would say, less reactive as it is really thinking about optimizing future growth and profitability. Obviously, we think this is a real investment in terms of leveraging future earnings. So we saw it as an opportunity. We have identified exactly what those actions are and how they will impact the business going forward.", "The whole point of the restructuring is to enable both the productivity on the revenue side, but the leveraged earnings we've been able to deliver to date that we want to continue to be able to deliver in the future. I don't think anyone lives in a world where you can say we are done. I think we continue to be opportunistic about it. We're not holding back, if you will, so we're taking advantage of everything we see possible in Q3 and Q4 announcements to really address and get in front of this curve. So there is nothing that we're holding out on that we would anticipate in the future, but that doesn't preclude us from saying whenever we see opportunities to get more efficient, better aligned and we can do it and still meet our GAAP expectations, we will do that, because we think that is the best way to serve our shareholders.", "Ben Reitzes - UBS Warburg", "Two more quick ones. Larry, if you could just tell us what tax rate we should be using now and in the future. I believe it is 31 or so percent in the fourth quarter?", "And then, Anne, if you could just comment on the competitive environment and what you are seeing with pricing, maybe not only in the 4Q, but what you think you'll see into next year, with some of your competitors coming out with products that are well anticipated.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes, Ben, in the fourth quarter we are saying 31% for the tax rate. Going forward, we will, at the investor conference, address it again. But normally what we do is we look at statutory tax rate; it's about 34% or 35%. We try to forecast what sort of discrete items we might have in the future and then give you a better idea of what 2007 will look like.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Ben, just on the competitive environment. I should mention that pricing really hasn't changed a great deal in terms of pricing pressures and investment throughout the course of the year. We've talked about around a 5% price investment on the production business, anywhere 9%, 10% on the office side. So that is not inconsistent with what we saw in Q3.", "It was clearly leveraged in a couple of areas, the office black & white being the one that we were most aggressive on and was at the high end of that price investment range. But we really are pleased with the results of that. If we're going to invest in pricing, it's going to be to drive the technologies that drive the most pages. That is why we are so focused on Segment 3 to 5 Office, because it is money in the bank for the future.", "On the environment, I'd put the most competitive part of the environment, it continues to be the very low end of color printers. We're seeing that in terms of the pressure on our OEM partners, in terms of some of that performance, although we were really pleased with our own branded activity, which was up 13% this quarter. Our branded color printers are also at the high end of the product range, which drive more pages. So given our druthers, our preference would be to have a more significant performance in the branded printers. But we do see  continuing pressure at the low end of the color printing.", "As you know, there is a lot of color announcements by competitors, some of which are not yet out on the market and have been delayed to next year, I know you are aware of, but we are prepared for that. That is why we have continued to make sure that the portfolio is completely filled out and competitive. We have the benefits of being out in the marketplace first, which is always the best place to be.", "Therefore, we also have some opportunity to be flexible and adaptable to make sure that we are aggressive in the marketplace, as competitors enter into the marketplace. But we know who they are, we know clearly where the strengths and weaknesses are, and we're positioned to be very aggressive and maintain our growth rates in the marketplace for Color.", "Ben Reitzes - UBS Warburg", "Thanks a lot, Anne.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - Banc of America.", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America", "Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. I just have a couple. Anne, with XMPie, you guys have started off on a little different course. It looks interesting. Maybe you could just back up and tell us how you are thinking about the opportunity to look at acquisitions to fill out or extend what Xerox currently does.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. Well, I think when we talked about acquisitions in the past, we said our number one priority was really the expansion and acceleration of our Services business. That certainly was characteristic of what we did with Amici in terms of the litigation support practice. And we continue to, I think, hold that in very much of a lead priority position in terms of our Services expansion.", "But the opportunity for us to acquire XMPie was really significant in terms of value creation and, quite frankly, support for our production business, which really is so well supported by the value of XMPie software. It was almost just a no-brainer for us to say that we already are such strong partners, why not take advantage of 100% ownership of this, still manage it as an independent entity, and quite frankly acquire the skills and capabilities in the software area that have not been our forte in the past.", "So, we built on our competency portfolio. It's an absolute logical fit in terms of the value created by our production suite of products. We have great experience with them, and this is a low-risk, high-value opportunity for us to drive more pages in the production area. So I wouldn't preclude that there could be more of those as well. I think our acquisition strategy is all about value creation, and XMPie was a really good fit there.", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America", "Anne, just to follow up, would you think that if there were to be additional acquisitions, they would be more in the production side of the business?", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think on the software side, because the production side of the business is so applications-driven and vertically focused, I think it makes more sense as it relates to acquisitions in that space. But I wouldn't preclude, I think the Office business actually is better supported by some of the Services verticals that are more horizontal in nature than perhaps the production business. So my take would be right now that on the Office side, we will be looking more for Services extensions, and in the high end it will be all applications-driven, which probably has more of a software flavor to it.", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America", "Okay. I have two real quickies then. XMPie is supposed to close here shortly. That is part of your fourth-quarter guidance?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, we've said basically that it is immaterial in the fourth quarter. But we do expect it to close in the fourth quarter.", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America", "Okay. The last question I had, Larry, when you mentioned that the earnings growth, the adjusted earnings growth was 21% this quarter, could you just refresh my memory, what was the tax rate that compares to for last year?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I think it was 31%.", "Keith Bachman - Banc of America", "Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Troy - Citigroup.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Good morning. Thanks much for taking the question. I had a few. I guess first of all, I'm trying to reconcile your commentary about pricing. Specifically, in your words, pricing really hasn't changed so much year-to-date, yet you are citing pricing at the high end, 10% or so, as one of the reasons you are re-contemplating your gross margin guidance.", "So I'm wondering how do you reconcile the two? You're obviously the ones out there that have been leading on the price investments. Is it commoditization creeping up faster than you would have expected in some of the low-end color? Are you seeing something competitively from Canon near-term and some other folks perhaps in the medium term that says it makes sense to turn the dial a little bit more aggressively on pricing? If you could just help me, just a little bit more detail there. I have some follow-ups. Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. So I was talking about an average pricing year-to-date, average pricing investment and when I said 10% at the high end, that is at the Office level. It is not 10% of the production; it's about 5%, and it averages generally 3% to 5% in the production market. So that has been much more modest.", "When we talk about pricing investments, we're talking about equipment sales. You know, it's not on the post-sale stream, which obviously represents three-quarters of our revenues. So I think we think about the pricing investments on equipment as being the acquisition of the customer, if you will, that allows us to capitalize on the post sale.", "The high end, I think what we're finding is that it makes good sense for the business to drive really strong activity rates, get the placements, win in the marketplace, and therefore put more pressure at times on the gross margin driven by the equipment side of this business, so that we ensure the best possible fuel for post-sale streams down the road and post-sale growth down the road. So I would say that it is really the implications of that.", "I think the other thing that we're looking at as well is that as we saw 7% growth in our Services annuity business in Q3, that is really good news. We expect that to continue. Quite frankly, the more we can get growth in Services annuity, it does put a little pressure on the gross margin, but it's really good news on gross profit. That is a trade-off and that is actually the strategy for our Services business, is to leverage gross profit, even though it won't be at the average of the equipment business from a gross margin perspective.", "So when we add all those dynamics together, Matt, we think it is prudent to actually plan potentially for a little pressure on gross margin in the short-term and still make sure that we can meet the overall expectations of the business. So it is prudent planning.", "We do expect that over time we can improve gross margin based upon the restructuring investments that we're making. But in the short-term, we don't want to sacrifice the engine of growth that drives our post-sale business, which is quite frankly being aggressive upfront and driving the activity appropriately into the market place.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "I understand the strategy. I guess two follow-ups, one to that point. I guess part of my question was geared towards Canon's product cycle and others. Do you see something in terms of the sacred cow, the aftermarket, the annuity stream, in terms of some of the pricing plans they have put forward are fairly aggressive on a per-page basis?", "Now granted, you can put forth your best foot in any kind of marketing presentation. But you folks have historically talked about a 5:1 to 6:1 ratio, color to black & white revenue per page. Do you see that all at risk in the coming product cycle? Is that is that perhaps fueling some of the pricing investments? And then I have one follow-up. Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I mean, in the current world, obviously Canon is late to market with their 70. So we have not seen any, obviously, activity from them at all that would suggest that that's driving any particular price pressure in the current. We do see, generally speaking, some modest, if you will, pricing declines. But the 5:1 ratio still holds in the aftermarket in terms of revenue and profitability. And by the way, if you look at any of the announced products, there is no breakthrough from a technology perspective that should provide any specific leverage, if you will, to the overall economics of the post-sale stream.", "So we work on things like consumables, solid ink, a whole set of capabilities that will allow us to drive price down when appropriate to accelerate the adoption of color. But we feel we are pretty well positioned for that, Matt, and better positioned than most, having a huge profile already in the marketplace with regard to our color installs, great technology capabilities that should allow us to leverage our pricing in the future and maintain the profitability; and nothing on the horizon that would suggest there is any really distinct advantage from a pricing and profitability perspective with any of the new entrants in the marketplace.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "Okay, and one last question. Just in terms of industry verticals, obviously graphic arts, commercial print, a nice area for you folks. It's nice to walk around Donnelly's facilities and see your presses populating their floors. But I wanted to talk, outside of commercial print, I  raised an eyebrow at Photokina a couple weeks ago, you folks had a bigger presence than I remember in the past with a partner there. Also at Graph Expo, showing some photofinishing capabilities, the iGen. Very interesting.", "I was wondering if you could talk about some of the alternative verticals, be it packaging, be it photofinishing, where you are focusing the iGen, where you are focusing the DocuColor, and what you see over the next six to 12 months. Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. I think we have been a little low key about it; I think you'll see a lot more to come. But there is no question that we are starting to play significantly in the photofinishing market, and that we believe there is going to certainly be some Lighthouse announcements in terms of iGen as the technology of choice in that market.", "You may have seen at Graph Expo we've announced some image enhancement capabilities for iGen that are totally focused on the photo market. We've actually partnered with some of our customers in that area to make sure that the iGen is well positioned to capture a big share of the photofinishing market. So I'm really excited about that. I think that we have selected installs right now that are doing some wonderful things with packaging applications that truly we have not yet exploited, and we believe that is an opportunity in the future as well.", "So, I think we consciously started out to really make an impact in the broad-based commercial print business, printing marketplace. And now our opportunity to really focus on things like photofinishing and packaging represent significant growth opportunities in the future.", "Matthew Troy - Citigroup", "I thank you for the color and I look forward to the Lighthouse announcement in photofinishing. Good to see you guys there. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers.", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much. A couple of quick questions, Anne. Just a clarification on gross margin outlook. I take it from your comments and Larry's comments that we're looking for gross margin of 40% to 41% in the fourth quarter. But it seems like that is a little bit more of a longer-term outlook also, until the restructuring savings start to kick in. Is that a fair takeaway from what you said?", "Anne Mulcahy", "I would not say it's a fair takeaway necessarily in terms of Q4. I think we're looking at this and saying over the next few multiple quarters, an average of 40% to 41% is probably an appropriate way to plan, still being able to obviously deliver the kind of leveraged earnings expectations that we can. I would expect, Carol, that we could see a quarter where it would improve sequentially because of the strength potentially of our seasonality of Q4 potentially. So it's not necessarily rigid by quarter, it is really more of the longer-term outlook. You are right, and we do believe that over time that our opportunity with restructuring will drive better gross margin performance.", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "And looking out on gross margin a little bit longer term, just conceptually speaking, given how competitive the industry is, do you think if you look out over several years that it's still reasonable to expect gross margins to hold flat at whatever, 40%, 41% or 41%,42%? Or do you think in the thought process we should expect some compression every year, with that made up elsewhere in the P&L?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, and that's one of the reasons I wanted to describe our view on what our Services strategy is, is that Services will provide some pressure on gross margins, but it's going to be great news in terms of revenue and gross profit. So that is a trade-off that we think is very attractive that could continue to put pressure on gross margins. But in terms of overall delivery, that is going to be a win-win proposition.", "I think we just said 10% of the pages are now being done in color in the portfolio. Think about the leverage that Color has going forward. 48% of our equipment sale revenues were Color this quarter. I kind of believe that Color is going to be an enormous source of leverage in terms of as it gets to be a bigger and bigger part of the portfolio that it will help very much on the gross margin side. So there is a balancing effect here with some of the growth engines in the Company that we certainly believe would result in an ability to maintain, potentially improve, just based upon the portfolio of revenues that we see going forward in the Company.", "But I think it's important to understand the dynamics of a Services business versus a Technology business and how that plays out for the bottom line, which we think is a really good, quite frankly, balance in terms of leveraging earnings.", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "A question on the fourth-quarter outlook. What would allow you to get to the high end versus low end? Although my estimate within that range is a little lighter than I thought you might provide, given that you had talked about last quarter being closer to the high end of the $1 to $1.07. So what changed in your thought process there?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think it gets back to this discussion on gross margin. As we go through the quarter, really recognizing that we want to be opportunistic about market opportunity, but yet certainly deliver within expectations is something that I think we are doing a good job of getting visibility to and making appropriate trade-offs. So there are always decision points on things like mix and price that we will have the opportunity to look at in Q4. But I would say that the thing that would bring us to the high end of the range would be our ability to exceed some of the range of 40% to 41% gross margins.", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then my last quick question is on high-end black & white production. You've done a lot to strengthen that portfolio. Do we see an inflection point there in the fourth quarter, or do you expect an inflection point in one of these upcoming quarters? Or is it something where the high-end black & white production just improved slightly sequentially, as it has been doing so far this year?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think seasonality obviously helped us in Q4; it is the strongest production quarter of the year. I said it in the remarks, we're very pleased with the progress on the Nuvera production system. There is no question that the growth rates year-over-year on Nuvera are very, very encouraging and taking off. So I do think we'll see some momentum on the Nuvera side.", "The Graph Expo announcements, which really focused on the highlight color publishing device, this is a complex market, but that is a big deal, to get highlight color into the publishing market. It has only been available for the transaction market. So that is an opportunity. That gets obviously assumed within the black and white space; that is how highlight color is viewed.", "The strength of the Nuvera clearly are both positives in terms of the production market going forward. We certainly don't seem to see a lot of slowdown in light production, which has been consistently strong. So I think we are coming through a period of time that certainly has been difficult and we're focused on some enhancements that really should drive better production mono business going forward.", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. Thanks, Carol. One last question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Hi, I got in under the wire. I'll keep them very brief. Can you just give us some color on what is going on in the MIF? I think a couple of quarters ago you said it had flattened out. I'm just curious as to what we're seeing in your MIF? And then just any more thoughts on cash usage, just to clarify continued share repurchase, acquisitions, anything we are missing there?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. So I think MIF continues to be good news. Total MIF is flat to slightly up, Shannon, which is great, because bottom line that comprehends both digital and all of the Light Lens degradation in the MIF. Our digital MIF is up 9%, which is very strong. The color MIF, and these are all machines in field, are up 36%, which we are pleased with.", "When we give you MIF numbers, it's important that we don't include printers or DMOs. So when you think about the activity that is being driven by our developing markets and the amount of activity that goes into the printer market, I think we are clearly understating MIF. But it is probably a safe way to look at a measurable compare. We think the MIF trend is nothing but good news as it relates to the impact on post sale.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Just one quick follow-up, before we move over to cash. Can you give us an idea, if you go back to '03, your post sale net of currency was down 8% year over year. Can you give us some idea as to sort of what the MIF look liked then, just to give an idea of the sequential improvement that we've seen over the last few years?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, certainly if you go back to 2003, and we can validate this for you, but MIF was actually declining even higher than the actual post-sale, because the post-sale takes time to absorb the revenue implications. But the Light Lens coming out at that point in time was so much more leveraged that we had double-digit declines in MIF consistently, probably for a two or three-year period of time.", "Now, obviously, that turn is significant and why we highlighted MIF being neutral and the digital MIF and the color MIF growing exponentially. It's a big deal. It absolutely is the most important driver of the post-sale growth, certainly in the short term. So we are pleased. We can certainly track that back, and it's a pretty provocative story in terms of the shift in terms of double-digit declines in MIF to where we are today.", "Shannon, on the cash, you wanted to know what?", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Just to clarify, I mean, it is still share repurchase, even though you've got $380 million left, your focus is still share repurchase over the long-term, as well as the acquisitions you've been making? Anything else we are missing there? Just wanted to make sure.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. No, I think our focus was that share repurchase is not an event, it's a strategy, it's an ongoing program. So we will continue down the path of share repurchase. We feel positive about that. We are very opportunistic in terms of what we're looking for from an acquisition perspective. Fortunately, the cash flow is enabling both of those to continue in a very strong fashion.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Thanks much.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Let me just thank all of you for joining us again. As a reminder, we do look forward to seeing many of you at our investor conference in New York on November 20th. So thanks very much and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the presentation and you may now disconnect your lines.

(NYSE:XRX)   Q1 2007 Earnings Call  April 20, 2007 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Anne Mulcahy \u2013 Chairman, CEO ", " Lawrence Zimmerman - CFO ", " Ursula Burns - President ", "Analysts", "Ben Reitzes - UBS ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", " Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", " Bill Shope - JPMorgan ", " Jack Kelly - Goldman Sachs ", " Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Operator", "Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation first quarter 2007 earnings release conference call hosted by Anne Mulcahy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Ursula Burns, President; and Lawrence Zimmerman, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call Ms. Mulcahy and Mr. Zimmerman will refer to slides which are available on the Xerox investor website at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's meeting will be tape recorded. Taping and rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. ", "(Operator Instructions) During this meeting, Ms. Mulcahy, Ms. Burns and Mr. Zimmerman will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Mulcahy. Ms. Mulcahy, you may begin. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thank you, and thank you all for joining us today. If you will turn to slide 4, we will provide you a summary of our Q1 results. We delivered solid results this quarter with install activity, color and services all fueling our annuity. Through revenue growth and strong operational performance, we grew earnings by 20%, exceeding our expectations. So it is a good start to the year. ", "We reported earnings per share of $0.24 and net income of $233 million, up 17% from the first quarter of 2006. EPS includes a $0.02 charge for our share of the Fuji Xerox restructuring. ", "On the top line, total revenue grew 4%, largely due to post-sale revenue growth of 6%. This includes a 3 point benefit from currency. Digital, color and services remain key drivers of steady annuity growth. Post-sale from digital up 7%, color post-sale, up 21%, and post-sale from our document management services increased 10%; all strong indicators that our growth model is delivering consistent and steady improvement. ", "Color across the board remains a highlight with color revenue up 17% in the quarter. Gross margins were 40.6% in the first quarter, which is about a half point improvement from the first quarter of 2006 and in line with our expectations. ", "Selling, administrative and general expenses were 24.9% of revenue, down 1.7 points. The balance sheet continues to look good. We generated $187 million in operating cash flow, and our financial strength allowed us to buy back stock while continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy. ", "As many of you know, we made news the first week of April with our announcement to acquire Global Imaging Systems, and this acquisition is on track to close in mid-May. When it does, we will tap into Global's extensive sales and distribution network for small and medium-sized businesses. We have the competitive products to serve these customers. With Global, we will significantly expand our reach to them. ", "That same week, the Xerox board named Ursula Burns President of Xerox. Many of you know Ursula from her excellent leadership of our office and production businesses, R&D, manufacturing and much more. She retains those responsibilities and adds a few more as we sharpen our focus on customer engagement and accelerating growth. Ursula is with Larry and I today. We're going to take your questions in a bit, but first I will review our revenue picture, and then Larry will talk more about our financials. ", "So if you turn to slide 5, it is a look at our revenue trends, noting the year-over-year compare in both actual and constant currency. So once again, total revenue was up 4% in the quarter to $3.8 billion. The leverage from post-sale was significant with post-sale representing more than 70% of total revenue and growing 6% in the quarter. That is a growth of $157 million. ", "During the quarter, we accelerated install activity in key markets and we continue to see a shift to more office services deals. As you know, the installs associated with these deals are recognized as operating leases and not as equipment sales. So this revenue shift cost us a point of equipment sales in Q1, but we see the benefit in post-sale over time. In addition, the continued impact of pricing declines did put pressure on equipment sales. Our strategy is focused on being aggressive in the marketplace with new products, value-added services and competitive pricing. By doing so, we expand our install base and increase our top line through annuity growth. ", "We said we would double product launches in 2007, and we are well on our way. To date we have announced 19 new products, ten of which launched earlier this week. About half the new products are color, with more to come. Our product portfolio remains the broadest in our business and in our history. This innovation keeps up a steady drumbeat of increased install activity. ", "At the same time, our Xerox services remain another key driver of post-sale revenue. Through multi-year, multi-million dollar contracts, our document management services generated nearly $800 million in annuity revenue in the first quarter to the 10% increase in post-sale revenue from services. Xerox signings for document management services were down in the quarter, primarily due to the compare from significantly large contract signings in the first quarter 2006 and the need for longer lead times to finalize some megadeals that are in the pipeline. ", "Color too has strong leverage on post-sale. If you will turn to slide 6, we will talk about color. You hear me say this every quarter, but it is worth repeating: the power of color is in the pages. More than 30 billion color pages were printed on Xerox technology last year and leading research firm InfoTrends just confirmed that Xerox's install base of DocuColor and iGen3 presses accounts for about half of the total worldwide page volume printed by high-speed color printers. So we are strides ahead of our competitors in this space, and you see it in our results. ", "Color pages were up 29%, leading to a 21% increase in post-sale from color and a 17% increase in total color revenue. We launched nine color products this year, strengthening what is already the industry's broadest portfolio of color products. We have kicked off aggressive marketing to promote the quality and affordability of Xerox color. So if you go to frugalcolor.com to take a look, I think you will enjoy it. ", "Our flagship iGen3 remains an important contributor to color growth. So turn to slide 7 for a review of our production business. Total production revenue grew 5%, including a 4-point benefit from currency. It was up 1% in constant currency. This is largely due to the declines in high-end black and white, and Light Lens also cost us about a point of growth. Install activity was stable this quarter, certainly not as strong as we expected it to be for the balance of the year, and that is primarily due to the cycle of product launches. At the On-Demand conference this week, we launched a major refresh of our production line, including new Nuvera systems with EA toner and advanced finishing, light production, continuous feed and additional features to our DocuTech highlight color series. ", "No one understands or competes in the digital production market better than Xerox. We know the market trends are clearly shifting to full color, highlight color and/or light production and our broad product portfolio plays to each market segment, and our strong relationships with graphic arts customers keep Xerox top of mind. ", "So here is a review of four key points: ", "First, the market for high-end cutsheet is declining and did have a drag on our production monochrome activity, but for us, high-volume page production from these presses still makes it a very profitable business. We have high-end monochrome well covered. In fact, we have just launched the Nuvera 288, which has two print engines connected together in one system. It is image quality that rivals offset printing, and it's the industry's fastest cut sheet duplex system. ", "Second, highlight color is a significant advantage for commercial printers, especially for book publishing and financial statements. We expect stronger demand for our DocuTech line, which offers custom-blend colors so commercial printers can match logo colors and other branding requirements for their clients. ", "Third, light production is a popular entry product in this space and an alternative for some office customers. We just launched the Xerox 4595 that gives customers advanced functions at an entry-level price point. ", "Fourth, more customers are moving from production monochrome to full color. Installs of production color grew 4% in the quarter due to strong demand for the iGen3 and DocuColor 5000. This quarter we saw the dynamic of lapping the successful introduction of the DocuColor 240/250, so the huge install rates of this product in Q1 of last year did skew production color activities this quarter. The additions to our DocuColor family announced this week will help us maintain our momentum in this important market. ", "The importance of these products always hits home in the pages. Production color pages were up 25% in the quarter. Every one of those pages has a direct benefit to our annuity, and that is why our model works. More pages, more annuity, growing total revenue. ", "New technology is at the highlight in the office as well. So, if you would turn to page 8 for a review of the office. Total office revenue was up 2% in the quarter and flat in constant currency. Revenue was impacted by pricing investments of between 5% to 10%, a rate we saw for much of last year and light production, Light Lens cost us a point of growth as we bleed off this business. We remain aggressive in the market to drive major placements of office multifunction systems, and you will see this benefit in the install activity. Install activity for segments 3 through 5 multifunction devices, which are designed for work groups and midsize offices, was up 11%. Strong demand for MFD's only partially offset a decline in installs for desktop devices that target small-business customers. ", "Our acquisition of Global Imaging Systems is strategically positioned to increase Xerox's distribution to this important customer base, and we have the products that serve small and midsize businesses. In fact, we launched seven more in February. They are all competitively priced and provide the quality and features needed by SMB customers. So when global closes, we will increase our distribution to this market by 50%, giving Xerox access to about 200,000 new customers. ", "Color remains a significant growth driver in our office business. While demand for OEM color printers was down, Xerox-branded printers remained strong in the quarter. Installs for color MFDs were up 71%, more good news on this front. Our product announcements included additions to our WorkCentre color and our DocuColor families, which we expect will generate more activity, more pages and more annuity growth. ", "So now turn to slide 9 for a look at results in our developing markets. In DMO, revenue was up 5% with post-sale up 6%. First quarter wasn\u2019t as strong as we have been seeing in DMO, but we are confident the pace of activity will pick up through new product launches and expanded service offerings. As a matter of fact, I just returned from visits to Russia and India where I spoke with customers who want more value from their investments in technology. We tend to think of developing markets as important for just product sales, and certainly install activity is strong in DMO, especially with SMB customers, but we are now seeing greater interest in services-led offerings that integrate managed services with our document technology. So we are focused this year on extending our services portfolio across DMO. We will see long-term benefits of this growth in our annuity revenue. ", "So this is a good place for me to hand it over to Larry. He has got more to share on the dynamics of our post-sale results, and he will review our financials. I will be back to wrap up and discuss Q2 expectations. Then Larry, Ursula and I will take your questions. ", "Larry Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne and good morning. As Anne stated, we are very pleased with our first quarter results. Our performance demonstrates our commitment to deliver shareholder value both in the short and long term. Revenue and earnings growth, along with consistent cash flow, is driving our ability to invest in our business, including the share repurchase program and strategic acquisitions. This provides major opportunities to grow both revenue and profit in our annuity business going forward. ", "Let's start by reviewing our annuity scorecard on slide 11. The results and trends are all quite positive and continue to reinforce the strength of our model. If we start on the top left, we see positive growth in digital revenue of 7%, 4% constant currency, 7% machines in the field (MIF), and digital pages were flat. Growth in digital MIF and color pages, along with the positive influence of color on price per page, indicates a positive trend. Color revenue grew 21% with MIF at 31% and pages at 29%. ", "In addition, when you look at the bottom part of the slide, you will see how this is a huge opportunity going forward. With color at 34% of post-sale revenue but only 15% of MIF and 11% of the pages, the growth opportunity is significant. These numbers will continue to grow and drive annuity growth. Keep in mind that the MIF and page numbers do not include printers in our developing market segment, which would only improve the results. ", "As Anne mentioned, post-sale from services grew 10% year-over-year, 7% at constant currency with an improving trend. This also contributes to our annuity growth and future. ", "The last set of numbers on the bottom address Light Lens, the analog transition to digital that has put a drag on our post-sale. It is only 2% of total annuity revenue and going away fast. This quarter it cost us about 1 point of growth. ", "On the black and white side, we are showing steady performance. Revenue was slightly down, along with pages, but the steady growth of MIF, especially in areas like Light Production, will drive higher page volumes. This positive annuity scorecard leads to my next slide, which is ultimately the key to our business model, annuity revenue growth. ", "And that is what we have: steady growth in post-sale with 6% annuity growth, 3% in constant currency. You can see the positive trend year over year as Light Lens has less and less effect on the total. The consistency of digital and DMO drives this growth. Other post-sale, which is from paper supplies and value-added services, is also doing well. So the foundation of our business model is yielding, and we expect it to continue. ", "Our earnings story starts with total revenue growth of $141 million. This growth, along with gross profit margin improvement of four-tenths of a point resulted in a $72 million increase in gross profit dollars. This is the primary driver of our earnings growth, and we continue to manage our cost and expenses well. Coming off our 2006 restructuring, we see the benefits in margin and expense. ", "Total expenses were down about $36 million, primarily driven by SAG. We had a pretax margin of 8.6%. Our tax rate was 31%, consistent with our expectations and up from last year. Equity income was down $33 million, primarily driven by Fuji Xerox restructuring that we disclosed in February. At that time the estimated cost indicated a $0.03 effect on first quarter earnings. Our portion of their actual charge for this quarter came in at $23 million or $0.02 per share. Net income of $233 million results in earnings per share of $0.24. That is 20% growth compared to last year and a solid start to 2007. ", "Our cash and cash flow results are quite good, and consistent with our expectations and we remain ", " confident in our full year guidance. Core cash flow of $118 million and cash flow from operations of $187 million are driven by earnings. Use of cash in inventory was expected as we prepare for product launches, including those announced earlier this week. CapEx, including internal use software, was $81 million, and cash from financing was driven by paying down secured debt of $165 million and share repurchase of $225 million. We ended the quarter with $1.3 billion of cash and short-term investments. We are pleased with this performance. ", "This slide takes you through some of our balance sheet thinking and gives a perspective on where we are going. Investment grade was and is our goal. We are investment grade with Moody's and in addition, with the announcement of the Global Imaging acquisition, S&P put us on credit watch positive and said they would upgrade us to investment grade at closing. So our consistent performance and delivery on our commitments has paid off, and we appreciate that the rating agencies have recognized us. ", "Our full-year core cash flow expectation is $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. As we said last November at our investor conference, we believe that $750 million is the right amount of cash balance going forward. We will continue to leverage our financing business 7:1 and expect to have modest core debt at year end. During the second and third quarter, core debt will be higher as we use our credit facilities to bridge the closing of the global acquisition and pay it down, consistent with cash flow. We expect to access capital markets as we replace secured debt with unsecured debt. ", "Our share repurchase program is fundamental to delivering shareholder value. We are committed to it and have done a lot in the last 18 months. We have invested $1.7 billion to acquire 114 million shares, or 10% of the previously outstanding shares. We intend to continue at a slower pace for the remainder of '07 as cash flow catches up to our payment for Global. Our acquisition spend will also be $1.7 billion after closing Global, including Amici and XMPie. All have the same opportunities and goals: strategic growth that enhances revenue and earnings growth accretive in year one and matched with cash flow. We are already seeing this progress with Amici and XMPie. ", "In summary, it was another quarter of effective execution on a strategy that is delivering positive results. I believe we are taking all the right steps to be even more competitive in the marketplace and attractive to shareholders. We plan to continue delivering this consistent performance. ", "Thank you and now back to Anne. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry. I'm just going to quickly recap. We started this year with good momentum on revenue and 20% EPS growth. Install activity, color and services are fueling our healthy annuity stream. We are bringing new technology to market at a brisk pace, already surpassing the number of launches last year. We expect our investment in innovation will continue to pay off with accelerated activity during the year. Our document management services and respected customer relationships with Global accounts give us a competitive advantage. ", "We've got an exceptionally strong product portfolio, and we are aggressively pursuing new sales channels and expanding our distribution through agents, resellers and our planned acquisition of Global Imaging. ", "We're managing the balance sheet effectively, costs are down, all giving us the flexibility to invest in marketing and growth areas. We are financially strong and remain diligent about generating cash and prioritizing profitability. ", "For the second quarter, we expect to deliver earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 per share. As we factor in the expected benefits from the acquisition of Global Imaging and this quarter's $0.02 impact from the Fuji Xerox restructuring, we expect we will be at the high end of the range for our full year earnings expectations of $1.12 to $1.16. We are confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, build value and win in the marketplace. ", "So thanks for your attention, now Larry, Ursula and I would be pleased to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Ben Reitzes - UBS. ", " Ben Reitzes \u2013 UBS", "Thanks a lot, good morning. Anne, any updates on your thoughts about Global Imaging in terms of accretion and the amount and what that would do to your guidance this year? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "No updates, Ben. I mean obviously we've got to close this deal before we can really dig in a lot deeper. I think what we have said is that it will be accretive. That accretion we would characterize as modest for the second half of the year. Obviously there is more to come, but certainly from what we know we are confident that with the aspects of absorbing the Fuji Xerox restructuring, what we see as modest accretion we can actually take our full-year expectations to the high end of the range. ", " Ben Reitzes \u2013 UBS", "Larry, inventories were up 11% sequentially. I was wondering if you could comment on that, and it seems like a little more than seasonal. I think you usually do build inventory for new products in the first quarter, but if you could talk about that and any efforts to reduce that, if it is a concern or not of yours? Thank you. ", "Larry Zimmerman", "Thanks, Ben. No, it is not a concern of mine. Our expectation was that it would be around this number. We always see growth in the first quarter and particularly now where we have new products that we announced, so we feel comfortable with the level that it is at. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Just to add to that, it really isn\u2019t just seasonal. I mean 19 new products so far this year, we have already outpaced the total of 14 new products in 2006. I think it really does support the rise in inventory to support the aggressive nature of product launches during the first quarter. ", " Ben Reitzes \u2013 UBS", "Last thing, just housekeeping. Larry, what tax rate should we use for the year? ", "Larry Zimmerman", "33%. ", " Ben Reitzes \u2013 UBS", "Okay. So it goes up a little back to 33%. Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch. ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", "Thanks, good morning. The first question concerns your equipment sales revenue. Excluding the addition of Global Imaging, would it be reasonable to expect that for at least one quarter of the year there would be a positive year-over-year comparison for ESR, particularly as you roll out the new products over the course of the year? ", "The second question concerns expense management. When the Fuji Xerox hit arose in the February quarter and that you would have to take a GAAP hit to earnings in the first quarter, you stayed within the range for the year, suggesting that you would be able to recoup the earnings hit later in the year through additional expense management and like efficiencies. ", "Now that you have already beaten for Q1 operationally, is the inclination perhaps a little bit less to do that for the remainder of the year than you might have thought at first? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "On ESR, I think what we have been trying to certainly point to, Jay, is that total revenue driven by annuity truly is our business. That is why as we look at the post-sale increase of $157 million and you compare that with the $16 million decline in ESR, it is really starting to pale in comparison to the post-sale growth. That is just going to continue. ", "The nature of ESR is going to be a little volatile. It is going to be about product launches and price investments and mix and that is why we are so focused on optimizing activity every quarter because that is what is really going to pay the long-term dividends for this company. ", "So to your point, it can be and should be kind of moving around both in a positive and negative direction; and yes, with product launch strength and certainly our ability to drive share in certain categories, we certainly do plan on it being positive. Yes, it will move around a bit, and we will certainly manage that with the opportunity to deliver very sustainable annuity growth. ", "On expense management, if you look particularly on the SAG line, we delivered very good productivity this quarter. We do believe that we have the opportunity to do a little bit more on the marketing front going forward so that we support this discussion, particularly on the activity side. We're not looking to sustain the amount of productivity that we delivered in the first quarter, although certainly we have always been focused on year-over-year benefits in SAG. ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", "Other than Global, can you comment on the other initiatives you announced in Orlando with respect to adding channel capacity? Anything incremental happen in the two months since that was announced? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes, I think we're working in, as a matter of fact our whole office team is focused on both the incentives for agents, the identification of the resellers that we're going to take up market in terms of the equipment side and working with those channels to make sure that they see more opportunity both in product breadth as well as business returns. So that work continues, and obviously that is an advance of the Global Imaging piece of this, which we will dig into after it closes in mid-May. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Troy - Citigroup. ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", "I had a question centering on two areas. I guess first on Global, can you give us an update in terms of your surprise level or learning curve with the reaction from the Japanese, specifically their desire to pull equipment from the Global platform? Has that been in line with your expectations? It may have happened a little bit more quickly than you would have thought. If you could just talk about the ripple effects of this announcement. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "We\u2019re not really prepared to discuss any of that in detail. I think what I would say is that these teams have worked very hard to anticipate any reaction on the part of the suppliers and make sure that customers are put first in terms of a seamless transition if required. So I don't think that there is any particular response we want to talk to at this point in time, other than to say that the Global and Xerox teams have anticipated and will be able to support any reaction by any supplier to the benefit of customers. ", "This was one of the things that we made sure we really had our act together on in terms of making sure that nobody was surprised regardless of the reaction. ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", "As a quick refresher, you had indicated an announcement that the primary driver, at least in the first 12 to 18 months, of synergy and opportunity would just be revenues; pushing the Xerox product through and getting that manufacturing margin on a more direct basis. Is that correct in terms of where the majority of the synergies come from? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, definitely the synergies are revenue-based. I would say though it is quite frankly just a business model of Global to deliver growth and great returns. Certainly on top of that, opportunities to intersect Xerox products into the portfolio really offers both leverage on the bottom line because of manufacturing margin and also a greater breadth of access to products that they currently don't sell, which would be incremental. So the good news is that even without some of those opportunities, Global grows very consistently and has a great business model. ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", "The second area touches on that, and that is new technologies. Certainly at On Demand this past week, Xerox is just an absolute clear standout in terms of the product breadth that you offer there. As you splinter across ever finer price points and your ability to surround any kind of competitive offering in the marketplace as they might emerge, is clear. The way I think about it, it looks like you have got about a year or two lead on a breadth basis. ", "If I turn my attention forward thinking of Drupa 2008, and I think about where Xerox plays, your page feeds off of the iGen3 platform are at about 110 pages per minute. There is inkjet technology out there in development that can go as high as 1,500 to 2,000 pages, and there is a whole market and opportunity in between. ", "I was wondering if you could help us think about that opportunity from a Xerox shareholder perspective? Do you extend the iGen or existing platform? Do you introduce a new type of technology, perhaps at Drupa? Is there an opportunity for an acquisition here? Can you just help me in terms of the page count opportunity and how you think about that on a two or three-year basis? Thanks. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, this is really a good opportunity to have Ursula address it. She is the one responsible for, quite frankly, the positive differentiation between Xerox and our competitors and for the strength that is being shown at On Demand. So Ursula, if you would take that question. ", "Ursula Burns", "We have, as you said, shown a force that is unmatched in the industry from a platform perspective, both black and white and color. We continue to leverage that platform, especially the color platforms that we have in the marketplace, the DC family, DocuColor family and the iGen family, up market but more importantly to actually solve customers' application problems. So not just speeds and feeds, but also knitting together whole sets of technologies to solve application problems. ", "We are investing and continue to invest in moving the iGen platform across, up and down frankly, and are looking at other technologies. But we are confident and clear that the technology set that we have today will be able to meet the needs of the customers in the next couple of years. But our eyes are always open, and we are always a little bit paranoid, as I have told you before, when I spoke to you, Matt, on technology. So we invest, we look, we keep close to the customers to make sure that we can actually deliver on their needs. ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", "Absolutely and congrats, Ursula. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers. ", " Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", "Thank you very much. Just a quick question on what you're seeing across the market in terms of enterprise spending. Are you seeing any signs of a potential slowdown? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think we would not highlight any difference or change in terms of enterprise spending that we certainly are aware of in Q1. We look at pipelines and activity and feel that there is a level of consistency that we are seeing with regard to our enterprise accounts. So I know that that has become a subject of certainly debate, but I don't think we would share the view that there is any noticeable slowdown right now on the enterprise side in the US. ", " Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", "On your gross margin, the gross margin on sales which had been going down for a while actually went up this quarter, and I think you benefited from positive product mix. Given the new launches you have announced and where you expect the activity to be for the rest of the year, do you still continue to expect positive product mix to help that gross margin, that part of the gross margin line? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think some of the things that we have seen in mix we have worked hard at that are driving some positive gross margin influence. If you look at even our Mono 3 to 5 performance, I mean we actually took over number one share in Mono 3 to 5 in Q4, and obviously that is a better margin leverage for us than the lower end of the office. The strength of color, I mean color multifunction up 71% in the quarter is just amazing and more to come with similar margins going forward, and that offsets; quite frankly, that kind of strength really positively leverages our color margins as well versus just the low end of color printing where there is so much margin pressure. ", "Because we have got this huge base of high-end production color as well, we are starting to benefit from the maturity and the size of our fleet in production color. I mean when you're doing 50% of the pages in the production color business in the marketplace, your ability to drive better margins just on scale is really a big deal. ", "So I would say yes, it is clearly mix, but it is also scale and the fact that we are out there early with products, and we have gained maturity that are allowing us to really leverage margins going forward. So we would expect that our ability to stay in our margin range and still make the kinds of investments in pricing that we do, should be sustainable. ", " Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", "Is it possible to get what your total mix has been year over year this quarter versus a year ago and what the total page growth was for the whole company? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "So we don't give you absolutes on that, but I can tell you what the MIF numbers are. Our total MIF grew 1%. If you remember in Q4, we said it was flat, so it is trending in the right direction. Color grew 31%, so obviously leveraged by color. Digital MIF grew 7%, so all trending in the right direction. Our color pages grew 29% for the quarter, which is certainly continued very robust growth on color pages. Basically our total digital pages were flat. Mono was down a little bit, although we think that is more seasonal than it is trend-based right now, so that we are not very concerned about. ", "I think one of the things that we really are pleased about is revenue per page is growing very nicely as well. So, as we look at it, that kind of annuity scorecard that Larry provides, that is why we can have such a feeling of confidence about our ability to sustain annuity growth going forward. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank. ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Overall revenue looked about in line. You mentioned gross margins were in line. Was the upside in the quarter primarily the result of the timing of restructuring and SAG and R&D related? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Actually no, I would be real clear about this one, Chris. The whole benefit in the quarter really was the annuity growth, the $157 million of revenue and gross profit growth of $71 million. We did great on the expense line, but you would look at that and the Fuji Xerox restructuring offset a lot of that. By the way, tax rate year over year certainly also was not a help. It was a hinderer this quarter. So I would make the case that, quite frankly, revenue growth and gross profit were really the drivers of the incremental net income that was driven this quarter. ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Is there any way to quantify the impact of currency on both the DMO business and the top and bottom lines? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "You know, we don't only because DMO is such a diverse set of geographies that at any point in time we have so many negative and positive factors. I think I would certainly say it was not terribly material in terms of the impact on overall DMO revenues or profits. ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Any impact to currency on gross margins in the bottom line? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "It is really hard to quantify. That is why we try to give you currency in terms of revenue. Clearly currency helped on the European revenue side, and we have quantified that. But you get some positive flow through on the revenue side, but then, on the SAG side, for example, it cost us about $30 million or $40 million in SAG. So it is hard to kind of net all that out and know exactly where you wind up. But it was clearly a help on the top line, and that will actually mitigate a bit for the balance of the year based upon the year-over-year spot rates. ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Fair enough. Lastly, can you talk about longer-term expectations for the DocuTech line? That has been lagging a bit recently. What I am looking for is kind of the two to three outlook for that business. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I am going to turn that over to Ursula. So your question is really about what do we expect from the DocuTech or the high-end mono production part of the business. ", "Ursula Burns", "We clearly maintain a leadership share in the mono production business. We just announced at AIM a significant refresh at the high end, focused at the very high end, and introduced some new capability as well and spoke about the Nuvera EA line that we just announced and our continuous feed engine that we announced as well. We now have 11 continuous feed products in the marketplace by the way, which is sneaking up there a bit. So we still have a very strong win rate, and we still have a growing participation in the light production segment. All that together I think will help us maintain our leadership share in the Mono space, even though that space is flat to declining. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Shope \u2013 JP Morgan. ", " Bill Shope \u2013 JP Morgan ", "Given the continued positive trends on the cash flow and the balance sheet metrics, particularly when you look past the Global Imaging acquisition, could you remind us of your thinking on dividends versus share repurchase and how that could change over time? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think we have been clear that this is not a question of \u201cif\u201d it is a question of \u201cwhen\u201d. We continue to prioritize for the best returns for shareholders. We only actually, it is hard to believe, began our share repurchase about a year and a few months ago, and we have already invested $1.7 billion into share repurchase. and I think delivered some very nice returns on that. We have always said that acquisitions had to be a big part of the shareholder return proposition over the long term to really fulfill the strategic goals we have on growth in the business. Obviously that has also materialized. ", "I think that certainly for the balance of this year our intent is to absorb our acquisitions, return to the set of metrics that Larry outlined in terms of the balance sheet metrics, slow down our share repurchase as we pay for the Global Imaging acquisition, and then quite frankly, get back in the business of share repurchase in a very business as usual way. ", "I don't think it would be short-term, but as we said, we think in the long-term dividend makes good sense for this company, and we, and certainly the board, would be very receptive to that conversation over time. ", " Bill Shope \u2013 JP Morgan ", "We also saw nice acceleration in color revenue growth this quarter. Can you give us a little more clarity perhaps on which products were most effective in the segment for the first quarter? If possible, can you give us a read on possibly which verticals may have shown increased color momentum this quarter as well? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think what I would say is that we were very pleased with the production performance of iGen and DocuColor 5000. iGen particularly after a very strong Q4, came back roaring in Q1 and was just a fabulous outcome. Color in total performed very well. As a matter of fact, uptick performance when you look at 9% equipment sale growth, 21% post-sale growth, 17% total revenue growth, you will see improvement overall in the total revenue growth for the company. ", "Our high end of the office line, which is the MFP line, was fabulous at 71% activity growth. The one I would say weaknesses, if you will, on the equipment sales side, not on the total revenue side, but on the equipment sales side, was really the OEM color printers. But that has become invest in getting the customers and see the returns in total revenue, and we are. I mean the total revenue picture looks good, but the pricing pressures there are pretty extraordinary. ", "I think you would say it was pretty strong performance across the board, and segment-wise color multifunction and graphic arts particularly I think with iGen would be the highlights. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Kelly - Goldman Sachs. ", " Jack Kelly - Goldman Sachs ", "Larry, on the SAG line, there was very strong performance with the 170 basis point drop. Can you talk about the total 2007 savings that we might get from the 2006 restructuring plans? I'm specifically talking about that $34 million number that you mentioned that was generated in savings from the '06 plan. Could that be $100 million, or are we pretty much there for '07? Just a sense of where we are in that process. ", "Larry Zimmerman", "Well, first of all, I don't think we forecast by line on SAG or gross profit margin. We try to give you a basic idea of where we are going. I think Anne covered it. We expect to see improvement in productivity and SAG. We don't expect to see as much as we saw in the first quarter, and I think that is what you should factor in your models. ", "Jack Kelly - Goldman Sachs ", "So in terms of the infrastructure, because that is what I guess a lot of that restructuring charge was taken for, are we pretty much where you want to be in terms of the infrastructure supporting the sales force? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "We are pleased with the pace of restructuring. I think to do almost a half point of margin improvement and certainly to see the kind of benefits in SAG, certainly a good portion of those are due to the restructuring efforts. As we go through the year and this is where Larry is alluding, one of the great things about this business model is that we are able to also make some investment decisions that can help fuel the long-term success of the company; and therefore, some opportunities in the marketing area we think are really a big opportunity for us balance of the year, positioned where we are from point of strength now. ", "Will our investments in restructuring pay off? The answer is absolutely yes, they already are, some in the shorter-term, some in the longer-term. Obviously some of the European restructuring pays off over a longer period of time than the U.S.-based piece. But we tracked this really rigorously, and we are quite pleased with the discipline we have had in getting the returns from our restructuring. ", "Jack Kelly - Goldman Sachs ", "In the production segment, you had indicated that there was about a 7% decline in installs of production black and white with high end down and light production up. If we just focused on those two items looking forward this year, do we reach at some point a stage where we could get a positive comparison out of those combined sales, the high-volume versus the light production? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think the answer is pretty much this is all about the pages. We look at this thing very holistically in terms of our production pages. ", "Ursula Burns", "As Anne said, the key here and the play here is about pages. So share is important, activity is important and MIF is important. If you look at those three metrics: share, activity and the resulting MIF that drives pages. As we mix our business, what we are trying to do is make sure that we get as much activity, as many machines in the field to assure that we can drive our MIF up. We are growing MIF in digital mono at 6%. Production digital overall including color is growing at 12%. So we are trying to actually drive activity such that we can get MIF, such that we can get pages. When you do that, we will take whatever install the customer wants. We have the breadth of machine to be able to do that so that we can actually get the results in MIF and pages. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research. ", " Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Good morning. Congratulations, Ursula, first of all. With some of the launches that you have done in the low end, and I would assume it comes through from the same standpoint of the year-over-year growth you're talking about, but when we look at the low-end MFPs where Lexmark and HP gained a fair amount of share last year with some of their laser-based MFPs, can we get an idea of some of the early indications that you guys are doing well with the products you have launched? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Ursula should take it up from here; I'm not sure we have had enough time yet. Those products got launched in February, the new suite of SMB products. But I have to say that the feedback during our summit meeting with our partners was pretty outstanding, and some of those products are pretty exciting. Ursula, you may want to add to that. ", "Ursula Burns", "Shannon, you correctly noted that we did have a fairly significant level of introductions in the first quarter. It is early. We just launched them in the middle of February, but we're excited. As Anne said, the partners who look at these products and who are ultimately going to sell them say two things: one is that the breadth is good, and the quality and costs are excellent. So with those two things and the distribution traffic that we have, we are excited about them and expect significant uptick. ", " Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "Any comments you can make on enterprise in Europe? You talked about the U.S. as being not weak relative to what we have heard from some others. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think a couple of things just about Europe. Actually the enterprise services opportunities in Europe are really very, very good in terms of actually big deals have kind of lead the way. So the services environment is pretty robust, but Europe is very cost competitive too. So there is a lot of pricing pressure in Europe that certainly we don't see as much pricing pressure in some segments of the U.S. ", "Nothing of note in terms of economic deterioration or issues that we would say are inconsistent, but our services business in Europe is very robust and pricing pressures continue. ", " Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "If you could just give us sort of your latest thinking on Edgeline now that it has been launched? I know they did not have it at On Demand, but any thoughts on the positioning of your products vis-a-vis what Edgeline is offering? ", "Ursula Burns", "We have a very robust portfolio of offerings from 40 pages a minute all the way up to 110 pages a minute cutsheet. We are confident that we can meet any customer's needs in that office segment of color. We thought we would learn a lot more about Edgeline at AIM, and as you said, we did not see them there. We were a little surprised at that. We think that we have coverage that is good, we have pricing that is outstanding, and we have a robust set of offerings. ", " Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", "From a cost per page basis, though, with some of the pressure we have seen on color, a multiple of $0.05, obviously Edgeline coming out somewhere around that. Are you at all concerned about where the cost per page is going, or do you think the elasticity of demand will offset that? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Two things. One is there is more to come from Xerox, obviously. We've got a lot more on the horizon. Some of it we just announced this week, but there is more to come, and Solid Ink is a headline in the more to come. ", "Secondly, we're prepared to do whatever we need to do on the pricing side. We have got the critical mass, we have got the base, we have got the economics whether it is just price reductions or whether it is different kind of segment pricing for color, we can certainly do any of that with the product set that we have got in the market. We are not overly concerned about that, and we think we've got a great head start. ", "Thank you very much, Shannon and we thank all of you for your participation and your attention today.

(NYSE:XRX)   Q2 2007 Earnings Call  July 25, 2007 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Anne Mulcahy - Chairman and CEO ", " Ursula Burns - President ", " Lawrence Zimmerman - EVP and CFO ", "Analysts", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research ", " Ben Reitzes - UBS ", " Matt Troy - Citigroup ", " Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers ", " Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", " Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan ", " Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch ", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Second Quarter 2007 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Anne Mulcahy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Ursula Burns, President, and Lawrence Zimmermann, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call Ms. Mulcahy and Mr. Zimmerman will refer to slides which are available on the Xerox investor website at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's meeting will be tape recorded. Taping and rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. ", "After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). During this meeting, Ms. Mulcahy, Ms. Burns and Mr. Zimmerman will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Mulcahy. Ms. Mulcahy, you may begin. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks, Jackie and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. If you will turn to slide 4, we will provide you with a summary of our Q2 performance. Our results reflect the strategic importance of annuities and acquisition, strengthening the top-line revenue and contributing to another quarter of earnings expansion. Earnings were $0.28 per share at the high-end of our guidance. ", "For the first half of the year, we have delivered solid results that keep us on track to deliver a strong 2007. As a result, we're raising full-year earnings expectation to $1.16 to $1.18 per share. In the second quarter, total revenue grew 6%, largely due to post-sale revenue growth of 7%. This includes a 2-point benefit from currency. Digital, color and services remain key drivers of steady annuity growth. ", "Post-sale from digital was up 8%; color post-sale was up 16%; and post-sale from our document management services increased 8% during the first half; all strong indicators that our growth model is delivering consistent and steady improvement. ", "Our acquisition of Global Imaging Systems closed in early May giving us the benefit of Global's continued strong growth trend. The transition is progressing exceptionally well, and I was quite pleased with Global's growth this quarter. ", "Our revenue results and install activity include the benefit from Global. At this point, Global does not track color revenues, so reference to color performance excludes Global Imaging. I will share more on the Global acquisition when I review our office business. ", "In second quarter, color across the board remained a highlight, with color revenue up to 12% in the quarter. Gross margins were 40.3% in the second quarter, less than a one point decline from the second quarter of 2006, which was the highest-margin quarter of the year. Gross margins remain in line with our expectations and factor in the Global acquisition. ", "Selling, administrative and general expenses were 25.7% of revenue, about flat from last year. The balance sheet continues to look good. We generated $388 million in operating cash flow; that's $575 million in the first half of the year, and on track with our full-year expectation. And our financial strength allowed us to buyback stock, while continuing to pursue our acquisition strategy. ", "Ursula Burns and Larry Zimmerman are with me this morning. We will all take your questions in a bit, but first I will review the revenue picture then Larry will talk a little bit more about the financials. ", "So if you will turn to slide 5, here is a look at the revenue trends, and you should note the year-over-year comparison in actual and constant currency. Again, total revenue was up 6% in the quarter to $4.2 billion. The leverage from post-sale was significant with post-sale representing more than 70% of total revenue and growing 7% in the quarter, that's growth of $231 million. ", "To provide a view of Global Imaging's results, the adjusted column on this chart assumes that Global's revenue for partial Q2 '06 is included in Xerox's results for the same period. Install activity was strong in key markets, especially color multifunction and production color. A greater proportion of our contracts, including some of our service deals, is recognized as operating leases, and not as equipment sale revenue. This revenue shift cost us two points of equipment sales in Q2, that's the revenue that benefits us in post-sale overtime, and declines in our OEM business for color laser printers cost us about a point in equipment sale revenue in the quarter. ", "While we continue to see the impact of operating leases, product mix, and pricing investments on equipment sale revenue, the solid results from Global Imaging provided a lift in Q2. With Global and our core business, we will remain firm on competing aggressively to increase placements of Xerox Systems through new products and expanded distribution, and to bolster growth through Xerox consulting and managed services. ", "Our results this quarter point to solid progress in install, in services annuity, and steady growth in post-sale. We said, we double our 14 product launches in 2007, and we have already reached that goal. To date, we have announced 28 new products, 10 of which are color. Our product portfolio remains the broadest in our business and in our industry, and this innovation feeds our install activity, which drives annuity growth. ", "Our services business continues to trend favorably with mega-deals fueling an 8% increase in post-sale from services in the first half of the year, that's more than $1.6 billion in annuity from services contracts, like the one we recently signed with the United Kingdom's Department for Work and Pension. That's a Xerox-led group, and it is now the Department's primary supplier of print related services, supporting more than 2,000 offices across the U.K. It's a seven-year contract, and our largest total services win, and it reflects the strong value we have placed on partnership. ", "At the same time, color continued to have leverage on post-sale. So, if you will turn to slide 6, we will take a look. With color, the power is always in the pages. Color page volume was up again this quarter, growing 30%, and now representing 12% of total pages, three points more than Q2 of 2006. Consider this: more than 30 billion color pages were printed on Xerox technology last year; and color pages are up, on average 29% for the first half of 2007. That means we are trending to benefit from about another 10 billion pages this year, if not more. We are strides ahead of the competition on color pages; and color pages remain our best source of annuity growth. Post-sale from color was up 16% in the quarter. ", "Color revenue reflects good performance in office color MSPs and production color, and that's without factoring in any benefit from Global Imaging, but does include the declines from the OEM office printing. In addition, we're seeing more color product on operating leases, including DocuColor and iGen3 systems. We are spreading out the benefit of the equipment revenue for the duration of the contract and accounting for it in our annuity revenue. As a result, operating lease has cost about three points on color equipment sale revenue, but again we see the benefit in the post-sale over time. ", "So if you will turn to slide 7, we will look at the production business. Total production revenue grew 2%, including a four-point benefit from currency, and it's largely due to the declines in high-end black-and-white printing, which is consistent with the Q1 trend. Early demand for the Xerox Nuvera EA and Nuvera 288 production systems is encouraging. It's too early to see significant contribution from these products in Q2. They launched in April and have longer lead-selling times. But we do expect that this is a second half of the year story, which will pick up in production. ", "We are also well aware of the dynamics in production monochrome, with the market softening for high-end cutsheet. It's shifting to more light production, highlight color, or full color, and we are covered in each area, and will continue to benefit from the profitability in the total production market. ", "Installs of production color grew 4% in the quarter due to strong demand for iGen3 and DocuColors 5000 and 8000. We have added to the products portfolio, which is already the broadest in the industry, with the launch of the DocuColor 8000AP. This product let's customers tackle a broader range of applications regardless of the paper weight or media type and that provides more flexibility, and how print jobs are run. ", "As you know, we typically exclude our Developing Markets Operations or DMO from our production and office revenue results, since DMO is a separate reporting segment. But with DMO's expanding growth, I think it's important to start to show the leverage from our strengthened business in areas like Russia, Central Europe, and more. Production equipment sale revenue from DMO was up 20% in the second quarter, largely due to more DocuColor sales, and factoring in DMO, total production equipment sale revenue would be up another 2% this quarter. ", "With any production device, especially color, the payoff is in the pages; production color pages were up 27% in the quarter. Every one of those pages flow through to our annuity, boosting post-sale and total revenue, and that was the key, as well, to the Global Imaging acquisition. Expanded distribution reaches more customers with Xerox Systems, generating more pages and more post-sale revenue. ", "So, here is the progress report on the acquisition on slide 8. Global's performance in second quarter was what we expected -- consistent, solid revenue growth. We had the benefit of their sales beginning May 9, and we are impressed with the contributions to the second quarter results. ", "Global's 21 core companies have access to Xerox's portfolio, and the number of products expands each week, as we complete training for Global service and sales representatives. One reason we bought Global was to tap into the expertise of their impressive leadership team and talent that they have in their core companies. We are really pleased with the retention of the team, and we are benefiting from their superior knowledge of the SMB market. ", "We have encouraged Global to continue their steady progress and in acquiring new companies to further expand distribution. They just completed the purchase of an office dealer in Rhode Island and have more to come. Regarding supplier relationships, Canon and Ricoh elected to stop supplying products. Sharp and Konica Minolta renewed their contracts; and other vendors continue to work with Global as well. ", "Regardless of vendor relationships, the first priority is serving Global's customers and maintaining their strong customer-retention levels, and we are doing just that. The core companies that did sell Canon and Ricoh have other vendor products that seamlessly fill the need, including products from the Xerox portfolio. With Global Imaging, we're reaching 50% more small and mid-size businesses, and accessing 200,000 new customers through 1,400 new sales reps. It's early in the transition and Global is already providing or proving the value of our investment. ", "If you will turn to slide 9, we will take a broader view of the office results. Total office revenue was up 5% in the quarter, and 3% in constant currency, and Global contributed to this progress with growth in the SMB market. The office market overall remains competitive, and we continue to invest in pricing actions of between 5 to 10%. The benefit of the install activity comes through in our annuity stream, with office post-sale revenue up 6%. ", "Install activities for segments 3 through 5 multifunction devices, which are designed for work groups in mid-size offices were up 9%. And last week, we added to this portfolio with the WorkCentre 5600 Series, our fastest office MFDs that print, copy, scan, and fax and offer expanded finishing and security feature. Color remains a significant growth driver in our office business. While demand for OEM color printers was down, Xerox branded printers grew 31% in the quarter. ", "Installs for color MFDs were up 54%. We continue to bolster this product lineup, generating more activity, more pages, and more annuity growth. In fact, last week, we launched the WorkCentre 7675, an advanced color multifunction system, and the leverage from developing markets, revenue in the office continues to grow. ", "As we highlighted on the slide, office equipment sale revenue from DMO was up 16%. Xerox's total office equipment sales would be up another 2% when factoring in DMO's contribution, a strong performance from DMO, and if you will turn to slide 10, we will provide more detail. ", "Revenue from our Developing Markets Operations was up 13%, with post-sale up 11% and equipment sale revenue up 18%, and that's the pace of activity we expect from DMO, as they move aggressively to win share and build annuity through install growth and expanded service offerings. While office printers and multifunction devices are the typical product leaders in DMO, sales of production systems are ramping up. ", "The commercial printers in countries like Russia and in Central and Eastern Europe are beginning to adopt Digital Production Presses with the advantages of print-on-demand and personalization. iGen3 adoption is especially encouraging in these emerging markets. So, on the revenue front, we saw the benefit of annuity, acquisitions and activity. Color plate well help to offset declines in high-end black-and-white systems and OEM printers. ", "New products plus more demand for Xerox services tee us up for a strong second half. And that\u2019s a good place for me to hand it over to Larry. He has more to share on the dynamics of our post-sale results and will review our financials. I will then be back to wrap up and discuss Q3 expectations. And then of course Larry, Ursula and I will take your questions. Larry? ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne, and good morning. Second-quarter results are on track and consistent with delivering our full-year commitments on earnings, earnings expansion and cash generation. The continued growth in equipment installs is driving growth in machines in the field, pages and annuity. In addition, the growth of color pages is increasing the average price per page, with opportunity going forward as color pages become a larger percentage of the total. ", "Global Imaging, in its first 70 days as part of Xerox, is executing the transition extremely well and is already delivering growth. The team is truly outstanding. So as we go through the numbers with half of 2007 complete and a lot of work ahead of us, we're comfortable our business model is working. ", "Slide 12. Our annuity scorecard continues to show positive trends that are leading indicators for future growth. If we start on the top left, we can see positive growth in digital revenue of 6%, 4% constant currency; 7% growth in machines in the field (MIF), while digital pages were flat. Growth in digital MIF and color pages, along with the positive influence of color on price-per-page, all indicate a positive trend. Year-to-date color revenue grew 19%, with MIF at 32% and pages at 29%. ", "In addition, when you look at the bottom part of the slide, you will see how this is a huge opportunity going forward. With color at 34% of post-sale revenue but only 16% of the MIF and 12% of the pages, the growth opportunity is significant. These numbers will continue to grow and drive annuity growth. ", "Keep in mind that the MIF in page numbers do not include printers or developing market segments or Global Imaging Systems, which would only improve the results. Additionally, post sale from services, another key indicator, grew 8% year-over-year, 5% constant currency. This also contributes to our annuity growth in the future. Black-and-white digital continues to be relatively stable. Revenue is slightly down, but pages slightly improved from Q1. And there is a steady growth in MIF, especially in areas like light production that drive higher page volumes. ", "The last set of numbers on the bottom address Light Lens, the analog transition to digital that has put a drag on the post sale. It\u2019s now only 2% of the total annuity revenue and going away fast. Overall, a very positive going-forward picture for annuity growth. ", "Slide 13. Post sale and financing revenue continues to support what the annuity scorecard highlights -- digital growth on trend; DMO with an extremely positive quarter; and Light Lens down to only $47 million and 1-point detractor from growth. Overall, a 7% growth, 4% adjusting for 2006 for Global, with about a 2-point positive effect of currency. The trend is slightly lower than first quarter due to some seasonality of supply sales that we believe will normalize going forward. So, we see annuity going forward on trend and continuing to support our business model and cash generation. ", "Slide 14. Earnings at $0.28 per share grew 12% when adjusted for 2006 highlighted items. Gross margin is 40.3%, within our range of 40 to 41%. We continue to manage expense well, with efficiency showing in both R&D and SAG, as both declined on a constant currency basis without Global and constant currency. ", "Last year's GAAP earnings were $0.26 per share, but included an after-tax audit settlement of positive $46 million, which was partially offset by $25 million restructuring and $9 million credit facility fee write-off. So last year's adjusted earnings were $0.25 versus $0.28 this year. Our tax rate this year was slightly favorable to last year's adjusted tax rate. Good cost and expense management continue, as we expanded earnings by 12%. ", "Slide 15. Cash flow continues to be a positive story; $382 million core and $388 million in total cash flow from operation, driven by earnings. Accounts receivable and inventory were uses of cash, but this represents seasonality and will improve by year-end. ", "Pension funding was lower in the second quarter compared to last year, as we moved our 100% funding contribution to third quarter. However, '07 will be lower than '06's contribution. Investing shows $81 million of CapEx and $1.5 million for the acquisition of Global. ", "Cash from financing shows the reductions in secured debt and approximately $1 billion of cash from our public offering of five-year notes at a very attractive 5.5% rate. In addition, we repurchased 64 million of shares, 280 million year-to-date, as we balanced share repurchase with our acquisition strategy. We still have 700 million remaining under our current authorization. Our annuity model continues to drive cash. ", "Slide 16. Before I give it back to Anne, here is a summary of year-to-date results. Our annuity model is on a positive trend. Installs are driving MIF and pages, driven by color, and along with Global will deliver going forward. Good cost and expense management continues, with gross margin in the middle of our 40 to 41% range. RD&E and SAG percents to revenue show efficiency and keep improving. ", "Earnings at $0.52 is showing the margin expansion we committed to, and at the halfway mark indicates our ability to deliver the full year. Year-to-date earnings are up more than 15% on an adjusted basis. Same holds true for cash, $500 million year-to-date driven by earnings. Cash flow and investment are managed in a balanced way, and we are confident in delivering our full-year expectations. ", "With our investment-grade rating, we continue to be successful in going to the capital markets to support our financing business, with a $1.1 billion five-year note with attractive rates. We're committed to share the repurchase program with $289 million year-to-date investment. So, my optimism going forward continues as we achieve our commitments. ", "Now, I will give it back to Anne. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry. So I'm going to quickly recap. Growth in the quarter was a good mix of annuity, acquisitions, and activity. And color and services continue to be leading indicators of post-sale improvement. The Global Imaging team is delivering great results, adding value to our investment and growing Xerox's presence in the SMB market. ", "We are continuing to expand our product portfolio, giving customers more options, available through more channels, at competitive pricing -- all supported by a broad set of consulting and managed services. ", "We are managing the balance sheet effectively, containing costs while investing in growth. And we are financially strong and remain diligent about generating cash and prioritizing profitability. ", "For quarter three, we expect to deliver earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 per share. And the solid start to the first half of the year gives us the ability to increase full-year earnings expectations to $1.16 to $1.18. ", "So, I would like to thank you all for your attention; and now Larry, Ursula and I would be pleased to take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question will come from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research. You may proceed ma\u2019am. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Hi, good morning. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Good morning, Shannon. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "A couple of questions. First, I might as well hit the equipment revenue. You know, I think it was a disappointment relative to where people were. And I understand that you're selling units and that\u2019s going to help drive the razor/razor-blade model. But do you think we are going to get to a point where we actually see constant currency growth in that line again? Or is this a situation where the mix shift and the pricing pressures are just going to continue to outweigh unit growth? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay, so let me talk a little bit about the dynamics of equipment revenue in the quarter; and certainly begin by saying -- do we think we will deliver constant currency growth? The answer is absolutely. And Global I think is clearly the vehicle to do that in terms of the model it has, to tap into the SMB market, which is largely an equipment sale model versus the major account kind of operating lease approach. ", "But in the quarter, we did see both operating leases and OEM business -- certainly the operating lease part of it was a larger impact than we have seen, which really reflects the growing nature of operating leases in the major account segment. So, that was a 2-point impact. ", "The OEM business was a 1-point impact. And the other thing is that we announced 28 new products in the first half of the year. As a matter of fact, eight of them were launched 10 days ago, on July 16. And those eight products are the higher end of the office market where we generated a lot of equipment sale revenues. ", "So, clearly that positions us for optimizing on the product side for the second half versus the first half. We have seen that dynamic before, when we have had a lot of product launches within a couple of quarters. So, we do feel optimistic about it and believe that the Global addition here is a huge plus as it relates to being able to deliver sustained equipment sale revenue growth over time. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay. And then a question on bad debt. It appears to me that the increase year-over-year in bad debt was about a penny. So, can you talk about whether or not you expect that to be recurring? Is this something we need to worry about? Or was this just sort of a one-time catch-up? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "So, when people have a chance to look through the MD&A, we do clarify the fact that it is off trend for us. It is an isolated incident. It is a European country, some customers within a European country that actually represented about $18 million of the bad debt. ", "So, it obviously had an impact on us this quarter. There is nothing systemic about that. As a matter of fact, the bad debt scenario in the overall receivables portfolio continues to show the historical strength we have seen all along. So, definitely an anomaly in the quarter and one that actually also quite frankly makes the SAG ratio look a little bit out of whack as well. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks Shannon. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come from the line of Ben Reitzes from UBS. You may proceed sir. ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "Thanks. I've two questions, if I may. I'm just trying to reconcile your comments about your annuity being on track and picking up with slide 12. I'm just according to our calculations it looks like excluding Global maybe pages were down, and I'm not really sure because digital pages were flat, et cetera, and that may, I'm not sure if that includes Global or not. But then, if you include Light Lens, it would just seem that the pages are down, and you're saying the annuity is looking up. If there is a way we can reconcile that till then how post-sale will look? I'd appreciate any clarification. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay, so actually not just pages, but all the metrics are quite positive on the post-sale side. So, let me give you a little bit on the page side. If you look at digital pages, last quarter they were flat. This quarter, they are up 1%. Color pages were up 29%, and they are up 30%. So, that's improving as well. So overall, quite frankly, the page metrics are good. MIF is even better in terms of growth. So, the product placements looked very positive quarter-to-quarter. ", "I think one of the reasons for the confusion about annuity and I said it earlier, when we were going through the slides, but or Larry said it I think, was that there was kind of an anomaly of supply revenues, quite frankly a disproportionate positive in the first quarter, a negative in the second quarter. But if you look at the first half annuity trend, it's right on track and clearly all the leading indicators are really quite positive, including pages and MIF particularly. ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "Okay. And these all exclude GIS? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Everything excludes GIS. We've no way right now of being able to track back to, and I don't think we'll in the foreseeable future. But both pages, and installs, and color revenues right now all excludes GIS. ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "Okay. And then with regard to your guidance, obviously the Street going in had $1.18, and obviously with the GISX calculated in there. So, with the lower tax rate maybe contributing about $0.03 in the quarter, and lower taxes for the year, actually the guidance you could look at maybe has less EBIT, less operating profit than the Street might have expected, actually maybe it's $10 to $20 million, maybe it's less. But is there anything that happened in the quarter on the margin side that would cause margins to be lower than you expected for the year? Or is it looking right in line with expectations? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think we're very comfortable with margins. As I said, we had a high point in 2006, but it it's pretty consistent with Q1. I do think we had some exceptionally strong performance from DMO and services that did depress the margin a little bit in the quarter. But going forward, Global it's a help on margins. So, we're quite comfortable with our margin estimates going forward. I'll let Larry speak to just the impact on taxes and putting that into context; because I don't think you should read into any less, if you will, flow through on EBIT than quite frankly would indicate very strong growth across the board. ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yeah Ben, how are you? ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "Larry thanks. ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "First of all, I would just say that when we look at the expectations we had $1.12 to $1.16 out there; so we clearly have higher expectations than we gave at a prior time; and we've taken our expectations up. And therefore, there is nothing in any of the numbers that has a negative thought in it. We just compare to our own thoughts of where we think we were and where we are now, and we're in a better place now, and that's the good thing from our standpoint. ", "On the taxes, the taxes are an interesting discussion because it's the way I look at it. Tax is just another line that has to be contended with in a quarter, just like bad debts, just like interest expense. And when you go through a quarter, and you have more interest expense because we bought Global or you have something happened in European countries, you might have a tax rate that where you had credits that helped you in a quarter. But when you step back and look at the whole thing, the numbers are the numbers, and I feel that's what this quarter represents. ", "I think, we forecast taxes the best way we can, and we try to give you insight into them, and that's statutory tax rates. We never can predict whether a tax credit can be used in a particular quarter, where the profits are exactly going to come out, so that you have the rating, because you have hugely different tax rates country to country. And so, I think that we try to give some number, as a frame of reference for it, and I think we come pretty close, plus or minus to that. And I guess that would be kind of where I land on the taxes; it's just another line in the P&L. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "And Ben, just to add to that, too, I think because now that we've two quarters behind us, we've also reassessed, and said that we think, we can deliver a 30% tax rate for the full year. So, that we've got a little bit more experience, so we're trying to guide something that accurately reflects the first half progress as well. So, that's good news, I think, overall. ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "And your answer really is EBIT's falling where you thought it would be? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yeah. I mean, I'd like at this, and as Larry said, I mean, so interest cost us another 10 or $12 million bucks in the quarter. We had this one incident of bad debt for $18 million. I mean, quite frankly, all of that offsets the tax credit. So, quite frankly, that is the nature of a 90-day period of time; and we're not uncomfortable that it's a good reflection of the operational progress. ", "Ben Reitzes - UBS", "Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question will come from the line of Matt Troy from Citigroup. You may proceed Matt. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Thanks. Good morning. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Good morning Matt. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "I had a couple of questions, one on color as a driver of the aftermarket inflection. I'm just trying to get a sense for what a sustainable growth number in color is. If I look at slide 6 and compare it even to that slide in the last quarter, your total color revenue growth has decelerated in constant currency from 14 to 9%; equipment 6 to 2%; post-sale 17 to 13%. Does this now stabilize? ", "I guess that\u2019s the law of large numbers. It's just a bigger business for you now. But at 40% of revenues, I thought color would have a little bit more of an impact. And I look at that; and I reconcile it versus 10% of pages, and say there is opportunity. ", "But I guess I'm just trying to understand, now that this is a bigger piece of your business, what is the sustainable growth rate for color going forward? And when you think about the page counts, 10% would seemingly seem low, but most color pages are going to remain black-and-white for the foreseeable future, is the theoretical limit 20, 25. If you could just help me put some context around that, and I've got a follow-up? Thanks. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. So, I would look at a couple of things that really we need to factor in, and I mean one of the MIF pages. I mean, at the end of the day, we say it constantly color is more about pages than anything else. It's less about actual placements than it is about the pages being produced. And pages grew at 30% in the quarter, which is right in line with what we've been seeing, literally. ", "So product mix can be a little different and drive some different kind of either equipment sale or placement numbers. But on the page side, we feel very, very positive about the sustainability of very high growth rates in color pages. I think that there are a couple of things that I would point out. ", "I mean, if you look at the impact of operating leases on color, a lot of like iGens are going to operating lease, which is great news. It's enabling, quite frankly, more iGen installs. But that clearly does not hit the color revenue line, equipment sale revenue line. And just in color production, that cost us 4 points of equipment sale actually, it might have been 6 points. I think 6 points of equipment sale revenue for color production, 4 points for production, and 6 points for color production. So, it was a big impact on the operating lease side for color. ", "And then again, on the OEM side as well, because that's a color business, and one that's a little volatile from quarter-to-quarter. But I'd look at it and say, this base of color is growing at a rate that we feel very, very comfortable with. The population growths are right in line, the page growth is right in line. We're very confident, and by the way, we've got 10 new product color introductions this year, some of which were just announced 10 days ago. ", "So, we're quite positive about color in general and the fact that, and Ursula, you may want to talk to color share, as well because that's really a great indication of the fact that we're winning in color on the production color side. ", "Ursula Burns", "Right. In production color specifically, we're pleased with our performance starting at the very high-end of the range. The iGen3 of production color family, we're pleased there and have good share performance on a quarter-over-quarter, and a year-over-year basis, and outstanding page performance and AMPV performance at that range. In the entry production color segment, we're the market. We've share numbers that are amazingly high there, and continue to win, and actually enhance and expand our product line there as well. ", "At the lower end of color, the high end of office, low end of production color, we're pleased there as well. We've a good fleet of products with some enhancements one product we just announced coming off of a very strong 240 and 250 product, and 252 and 242 that we launched in the first quarter of the year. In the office, full range as well. So, as Anne said, very, very good color fleet, broad offerings, excellent placements, and share, and I'm holding our own or moving forward, as you would expect Xerox to do. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "I guess I've certainly been a public fan of the breadth and strategy, and certainly the activity. I guess a lot of this feels like you just got to run like hell to stay in place\u2026 ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, what I\u2026 ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Means to, and that's not a Xerox issue; that's an industry issue, which brings me to the broader question. Are there investments, you could be making or actions you could be taking if you weren't a public company? Can you talk to me about your views on being public versus private that the pros and cons of each? Thanks. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, let me just say one thing, Matt, on running fast. I mean, I think, you need to look at total revenue in color. We\u2019re totally confident that double-digit growth in total revenue is sustainable. Obviously, as the base gets bigger and bigger, those numbers get a little bit muted, but the absolutes are making a terrific contribution. So, we'll try to help a little bit in the future by giving you some absolute revenue numbers as well as growth numbers. Because this base is really powerful and even if the rate of growth comes down a little, as long as we're comfortable that we're getting the absolute growth, I think, it will continue to have a large impact as well. ", "I'd just say this is a company that is very comfortable being a public company. We're pretty focused on doing the right things and investing for the future. We got a long history here of putting this company in shape for the long-term. So, I don't think, we're doing anything that we don't feel is appropriate to build long-term shareholder value. And quite frankly, I'm a big spokesperson now for the fact that we all ought to focus on the long-term shareholder value side of this and that really ought to be our primary focus as a public company. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "I've noticed that; and hence the question. Last one you guys are leaving tons of footprints in the snow on the photo imaging side, which is a great new market for you. I get calls; I talk to people that say you are knocking on all kinds of doors. Can you talk about the learning curve there? I mean, you announced some products not too long ago, and you have been looking at the market for some time now. What are you seeing in terms of uptake, trajectory, and opportunity, and what is essentially a new green-field market for you? Thanks. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Ursula, why don't you take it? ", "Ursula Burns", "So, we're it's a good question, I'm actually happy to answer it. We're excited about the photo finishing market. As you said, we're leaving footprints allover the place there, working with our partners, Fuji Xerox, to expand our market into kiosk photo printing and photo with Fuji film we've been able to start slow in the beginning of the middle of last year, but really pickup the pace and expand our offering. ", "It's going very well. Actually, the photo kiosk market and business that we're in with Fujifilm is going very well. Well enough for us, it's still early, but good enough for us to start expanding into Canada and into other Western European markets. So, we are pleased there, good start in the United States. But it's not only through that venue or that path that we are getting into photo finishing. ", "We also announced earlier this year, enhancement to our entry production color and our production color engines, the 8000 and 7000 family and iGen3. These enhancements allow us to actually get more pages moved from traditional photo finishing applications or processes to our digital cut sheet offering. So, I think, you're right, it's a good, exciting market. We're expanding it through our partnerships, but also through enhancements on our own engines, and we're moving it as fast as we can. ", "Matt Troy - Citigroup", "Thank you very much for the time. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks Matt. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come from the line of Carol Sabbagha from Lehman Brothers. You may proceed Carol. ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much. Just a quick question on the industry, and a couple of questions on Global Imaging. Your equipment sales decelerating in the quarter, you talked about several reasons why that happened. What did you think the industry did in the quarter? Did that also weaken or do you think it's held up from 1Q levels? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think it depends, Carol, on the mix of business that you have. I mean, a Global kind of company, which is more of a dealer company, is an equipment sale model. And I think you will see less of a swing, if you will, to the annuity business. I mean, we happen to think that that is a very great positive that it swings to the annuity business. ", "But I do think you will see some of the dealer companies or the printer companies that are equipment sale models being less impacted by that swing than a Xerox. I think this is really more, I think, indicative of a services company, which is less dependent on kind of the equipment capitalized transaction. And I think that is really what is driving, quite frankly, the shift in Xerox. ", "Now having Global will make more muted, because obviously they are an equipment sale model company. But we didn't see anything in price, Carol that would suggest that there is anything more than the traditional pace of price investments during the quarter. I think the only real slowdown we saw on equipment sale is the OEM business. ", "That was certainly year-over-year a big detractor on the equipment sales side. But that business by nature is going to be a little volatile. So I think we are confident that will pick up. And when you look at the full-year results, you will see a very good, strong, profitable business from the OEM sales. ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, thanks. And then on Global Imaging, if you looked at Global 2Q last year versus 2Q of this year, did it get to its 10 to 11% growth rate that I think you are targeting going forward? Was it better than that? And then the other question, maybe a little too early to ask this type of question. But of the leases that have come up for renewal with Global since you have owned it, what percent have you been able to renew? And what is kind of general for the industry renewal rates, typically? ", "Ursula Burns", "So, just let me begin, I don't think we have really, first of all, I think we would suggest that Global's revenue, as you look at Q2 '06 and Q2 '07, is consistent. I am not sure that 10 to 11% would be the accurate number there. So, but it is consistent. We have not seen any degradation there. I think the bigger impact, early days, is on the fact that transitioning on the profit side obviously reflects the absorption of deal expenses and transitional costs that certainly mutes the profit flow through. Although we said for the balance of the year it will be modestly accretive. ", "So, regarding revenue, we're really pleased to see a level of consistency in Global's performance. It is too early, I think, to give you anything that is statistically valid on the retention side. But when we asked the Global team, I would tell you that they are pleased with customer retention at this point in time. So, they have seen no early indicators that there is anything that they are concerned about. And I think they continue to give us feedback that the transition in the product portfolio is an opportunity based upon the strength of the Xerox products. ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Then one last question on use of cash. Has your view changed at all from sort of the last conference call about what you would do after you pay down the incremental debt you put on for Global Imaging? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Larry? ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "You mean from the standpoint of the two things, our share repurchase and acquisitions? ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Yes. ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "No, I had to change. ", "Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come from the line of Chris Whitmore from Deutsche Bank. You proceed Chris. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "I wanted to come back around to equipment sales one more time, but this time focus on the high-end production monochrome business. Hoping for some more color as to the unit weakness and install weakness there, and to get more color on what is happening. Is this a technology transition where Xerox is losing share to competitors? Is that the primary issue here? Or is the overall market just declining? Thanks very much. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "So, I would say that this is not a market we are looking to for growth. And obviously, our shares continue to be leadership in the mono production cut-sheet market. So we're holding our own. You know, I think one of the things we are pleased with, if you looked year ago at the performance for example, Nuvera. ", "We had a very strong year-over-year increase in Nuvera placements. But we are seeing, obviously, an overall weakening, if you will, of the market. So, it is not demonstrating in total revenue growth. I think the approach that it's taking, Ursula, you might want to talk about it is more kind of we have to look at this production market differently as a whole portfolio of different technologies. ", "Ursula Burns", "Correct. Hello, Chris as Anne said, this is not a market that we are looking for in this segment alone for growth. It is largely a replacement market. We have a competitor who has launched a product that is actually replacing its base; that is the Canon product that was launched earlier this year. It is replacing its base and turning their current MIF. ", "We actually look at this market in whole, not only in production mono cut-sheet, but we look at it with highlight color, with color production -- as you see the good results there -- and with light production and continuous feed. If you look at that entire set of offerings to the marketplace, we will see -- continue to see strong performance in production in general, not in mono only; but in production in general. And you have to look at it that way because the mono market is one that is declining. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "The second question relates to kind of competitive environment. Have you see much of HP's Edgeline product out there in the marketplace? Are they having any impact at all? Secondly, have you seen any change in the broader competitive landscape from a pricing standpoint? Thanks very much. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I don't think we have seen much of Edgeline at all. So it has been, I think, somewhat surprisingly quiet in terms of Edgeline's presence in the marketplace. So, you know, we are watching, and obviously very observant. But I think it is fair to say we have a pretty good touch with the marketplace and we're not seeing much happening there. ", "I don't think there is really anything that we would view on the competitive side that is dramatically different quarter-over-quarter. And including pricing, as I mentioned, in the 5 to 10%. I think if anything, we probably changed the dynamics the most in terms of the amount of product introductions we have made during the first half of the year. ", "Ursula Burns", "Right, the other product that Anne didn't mention that we were waiting for and looking for is Canon 7000 machine, in addition to the Edgeline, which has gotten a lot of press. We are still confident with our range of products. And the good news is that we are still winning decisions, especially in the color space, monochrome space as well, and we have not seen a lot of either Edgeline or the Canon 7000, yet. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks a lot. ", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come from the line of Bill Shope from J.P. Morgan. You may proceed sir. ", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. A few questions on Global. You stated that you're working to maintain the customer base despite the Canon and Ricoh departures. Can you give us some color on exactly how you are doing that promotions or training of the customers, and whatnot to switch them over to Xerox equipment? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, first of all, we are not -- I mean, these customers have Canon and Ricoh products on leases that are being maintained and serviced and supported throughout the duration of their leases. So there is no disruption to the customer base whatsoever. The opportunity for replacement comes at the lease renewal time. So that will be kind of staggered approach as leases come up for renewal. ", "And the Global team has a lot of time, obviously, to market and prepare and quite frankly sell the value of replacement technology that offers more technology for quite frankly very competitive prices. So there is no disruptive approach here to integrate at the end of a lease a different offering. It is not something that we are faced with. They have got the parts and the ability to support these products throughout the duration of the leases. ", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "So, at the end of the lease, that is when you approach them with Xerox solutions? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "If that is the right answer, yes. ", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Larry? Larry wanted to add something. ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I just wanted to add one thing that I always find curious here, which is the Xerox brand-name and the fact that we invented this whole industry, I think plays a part in the fact that I don't think there is a huge difficulty here in migrating customers to our brand. So, I think everything Anne said is right here that these are staggered and our people are trained. ", "And when we were talking to Global Imaging, they were so impressed with our product line, and they felt that they had so much more out there with our product line than they currently had in the marketplace, that it was a huge plus to them going forward to be able to sell the Xerox products. I think we all should just step back and consider that. It is all customer based. So, we will do what is right for customers here, but I think the Xerox brand and our breadth of our product line are going to lead here. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "I think it is interesting, but part of what we're trying to do is to actually make sure that we are managing the pace of product adoption here. The Global folks are very excited about it -- our engineering products, our high-end production products, our package services offerings. So, we are really focused on making sure we do this right and we do it in a way where there is good training and understanding of the products before we deploy all the products out there. ", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Then my second question will be on the accretion path for Global throughout the year. Should we assume that most of the accretion is going to be fairly back-end loaded into the fourth quarter? Should we assume that perhaps there are some integration savings that start to heat up as you roll the acquisition up, closing out the year? ", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well, I think first of all, we should assume that strategically, which is the reason we bought Global that it is going to be a huge help to Xerox and it's going to make a huge difference going forward. I think, as you go through the first 160 days that you have an acquisition that there are a lot of transition costs. ", "There is interest expense for two quarters here that we deal with. And so, we have tried to factor in, in our outlooks, everything about our business including Global. So, there is some accretion there. We don't think it has made a huge difference in the short term. But in the long term, this is really strategically right and going to be very accretive to the Company. ", "Bill Shope - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, great. Thanks a lot. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thank you. One more question, I think we have time for. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Your last question will come from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Merrill Lynch. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Almost right. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Hi, Jay. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Actually, I do have more than one question if that is okay. I would like to start first with placements and market share trends. I appreciate what you're saying about overall placement activity and of course Ursula's reference to your predominance at the high end. However, when we do look at some of the other further down segment data, we do see that there are a number of segments where your share gains are not necessarily as broad or as consistent as they once had been a couple of years back. ", "Of course, Canon would now seem to be predictably in a bit of a bottoming process, given products other than the 7000 that they have produced since the summer. So, I guess the question is, where do you think you need to refocus your efforts on recouping share or otherwise redoubling some of your marketing effort and investments in some of those, let's say mid speed color copier and printer segments, where it does seem, as though you have lost some percentage share versus others? Then a follow-up? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay, I think that if you look at where we gained share, obviously the last share info we have is Q1. And where we think we made good progress -- and if you do look at the kind of office black-and-white Segment 3 to 5, we either hold or gain a point or 2 of share every quarter. So we have been I think doing pretty well there. ", "However, we have just announced a complete refresh of that product line, so we expect that to accelerate. We really put a focus from a product perspective on the entry in color, and we gained share on the Segments 1 through 20. And where we have been not as aggressive, if you will, on the share gain side has been in the higher end of office color. ", "And Ursula, we just introduced the 7675 and the refreshes on the 242, 252, 260. So, we got a whole line of new color office products that should strengthen our share position. We are doing great in EPC. I mean, our share is in the 80s; it continues to build. And we gained share in iGen. So, I would look at it and I think we would say, and maybe Ursula, the one place you would look and say we ought to invest for share is --? ", "Ursula Burns", "Continuous feed. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Continuous feed? ", "Ursula Burns", "Continuous feed, both monochrome and black-and-white is an opportunity area. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Monochrome and color. ", "Ursula Burns", "Sorry, monochrome and color is an opportunity, Jay. We have talked about this before. It is an area that we are investing and will continue to invest to assure that we capture that market, which is capturing pages. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Right. But you know what, Jay? I think we would all sit here and look right now with the products that we have launched and say the biggest challenge we have to share gain is distribution. It is not product power. And that\u2019s really where Global comes in, particularly its focus on the office SMB market; and that\u2019s where we want and should demonstrate results in terms of share gains. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Then to finish up, you did earlier in the year announced earlier initiatives on the SMB and VAR side prior to the Global announcement. So what is this status of all that? And then finally, sometime over the last year you have made some announcements regarding trying to improve supply chain and operations and procurement and the like; moving things into China, and so forth. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "What is the operational improvement that you've been gaining from those earlier announcements? ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. So the piece I will talk about on the announcements we made earlier in the year was really on the agents and the reseller side. And I think we are pretty pleased with the progress that we are seeing. In fairness, we are rolling out a lot of the enhancements this quarter on the reseller and the agent side. So, I think the better test will probably be second half of the year. But I personally participated in the calls with some of our largest agents, and I think they are very excited about the enhancements we have deliver to the agent population. ", "On the reseller side, I think we are seeing good progress. By the way, we didn't give you the number, but our Xerox-branded color printer sales were up 31%. And I think we are really strengthening, I think, our incentives for the reseller model. And that\u2019s indicative of what we are seeing on the Xerox printer side. But I do think that the full test -- I mean, we announced a lot of this in the first quarter. But we are definitely still rolling it out; and I think the true test will be second half of the year. But Ursula, talking about supply chain? ", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, two areas, Jay that we have put a lot of focus on. One that we have had to actually put into practice immediately with Global, the first area was a supply chain for the channel, a supply chain that matched the channel. I mean, we've an excellent high-end supply chain and can deliver and match up against any competitor in the marketplace, and excellence there. ", "What we are doing is expanding our supply chain to ensure that we can actually meet the needs of high turn, so high frequency buy, and delivery customers. And we're doing that by developing a supply chain for that specific type of business, and we're putting it into practice with Global. ", "I think that you will see if you would be able to speak to the Global people that they are very, very pleased with our ability to serve them and to deliver on their needs. So, the first area is the supply chain for every channel. The second area that you pointed out was expanding and basically relocating our production procurement activities outside of the United States. ", "Most of our suppliers for either piece parts or equipment come from outside the United States and Europe. And we've moved our production procurement activities; it's now headquartered in the Far East, so that we can be close to the suppliers there, and leverage our excellence in engineering with their excellence in delivery. We've been able to do both those things. There are still activities going forward to continue to improve the supply chain, but we're very pleased with the progress so far. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay. Thanks, Jay, and thanks for all of you for joining us today. We believe our progress in the first half of the year is on track, and that we're going to deliver a strong 2007. So, thanks for your participation. Have a great rest of week.

If you could turn to slide 4, we\u2019ll provide you a summary of our Q3performance.", "As you can see by our performance this quarter, our strategyis on track, the business model is generating double-digit, bottom lineresults. We delivered EPS of $0.27, slightly higher than our expectations and a17% improvement over our adjusted results from Q3 last year.", "We feel good about our progress this quarter and believe weare well-positioned to deliver another year of solid earnings expansion.", "We now expect full year earnings per share to be in therange of $1.18 to $1.20. Total revenue, which includes the benefits of ouracquisitions, was up 12% this quarter to $4.3 billion. During the quarter,post-sale revenue, which accounts for more than 70% of our total revenue, grewby 11%.", "Currency gave us about a three point benefit. In a moment,I\u2019ll provide more detail on the revenue picture with and without the inclusionof Global Imaging.", "Highlights in the quarter include a 13% increase in colorrevenue. Color now accounts for 39% of our overall revenue and more than 50% ofour equipment revenue comes from the sale of color systems.", "Color was the heavy hitter across the board with an up-tickin iGen3 install and a 69% increase in installs of our color multi-functiondevices.", "We maintained gross margins at 40.1%. Selling,administrative and general expenses were 25.4% of revenue, just slightly betterthan last year. We ended the quarter with $286 million in cash from operations.We purchased $212 million worth of shares, bringing our total share buy-back to$2 billion since we launched the program two years ago.", "Just last week, we closed on the purchase of Advectis for$32 million. Advectis\u2019 technology created the electronic loan folders,streamlining the mortgage process for lenders and brokers. Not unlike ouracquisition of Amici last year for the legal market, Advectis increases ourpresence in an important, document-heavy industry and strengthens our servicesbusiness.", "Ursula Burns and Larry Zimmerman are with me this morning.We\u2019ll all take your questions in a bit, but first I would like to review ourrevenue picture and then Larry will talk more about our financials, so pleaseturn to the next slide.", "So here\u2019s a look at our revenue trends, noting that theyear-over-year compare in actual and constant currency. The adjusted column onthis chart assumes that Global\u2019s revenues for Q306 is included in our resultsfor the same period. Again, total revenue was up 12% in the quarter to $4.3billion.", "When we adjust the compare for Global Imaging, revenue wasup 4% with two points of positive currency.", "The leverage from post sale continues to be significant. Itwas up 11% in the quarter. That\u2019s an increase of $314 million with Global.Adjusting for Global and the benefits in currency, we\u2019re quite pleased that thetrend in post-sale continues to be favorable, increasing 3% in Q3.", "This was our first complete quarter with Global Imaging. Asexpected, Global is transitioning into selling and servicing more Xeroxsystems, while continuing its strong support of other vendors\u2019 products.", "Global\u2019s results were on par with our expectations for thequarter, especially considering the effects of the transition and the timeinvested for Global sales and service reps to learn more about our offerings.", "During the third quarter, Xerox benefited from 38 new officeand production products launched this year, as well as broader distribution tosmall and mid-sized businesses through the Global acquisition.", "Equipment sales were up 14% over the prior year, or flat onan adjusted basis, including a 2% benefit from currency.", "A greater proportion of our contracts, including some of ourservices deals, is recognized as operating leases and not as equipment salerevenue.", "This revenue shift cost us two points of equipment sales inQ3, heavily weighted in the production end of our business.", "While we don\u2019t see the revenue in equipment sales, it flowsthrough to post-sale revenue over time and we\u2019ll see the benefit of thisoperating lease trend in our post-sale as we deliver steady annuity growth.", "With Global and our core business, we are competingaggressively to increase placements of Xerox systems through new products andexpanded distribution, and bolstering growth through Xerox's consulting andmanaged services.", "Services deals fueled an 8% increase in post-sale fromservices to the third quarter of this year. Large services deals typically havea long lead time, and several big wins hit us in Q3 rather than later thisyear.", "In fact, we recently signed a $93 million contract with theU.S. Navy to provide equipment and services for its entire fleet, and an $82million multi-year outsourcing deal with EuroPart, Europe\u2019s largest auto partsdistributor. We are managing all of their office and production printing, as wellas customer service centers.", "At the same time, color continued to give us a big boost toour annuities, so if you turn to slide 6, we\u2019ll take a look.", "With color, the power is always in the pages. Right now,Xerox office and production systems are on pace to produce more than 40 billioncolor pages this year. That is about 10 billion more than last year. We aremiles ahead of our competitors on color pages and pages remain the best sourceof annuity and profit growth.", "Color page volume was up again this quarter, growing 32% andnow representing 13% of total pages -- three points more than Q3 of 2006.", "Revenue from color this quarter was up 13%, 10% on constantcurrency. Post-sale from color was up 17% in the quarter. That\u2019s withoutfactoring in any benefit from Global Imaging. The solid results reflect steadydemand for Xerox office color MSDs and production color systems.", "Last month, we unveiled an industry first, bringing theprice of printing a color page down to that of black and white. We launched ourPhaser Solid Ink Printer in MFD that breaks the price barrier for customers whoneed affordable, quality color systems and use them a lot to get business done,like realtors, designers, and contractors.", "With the advancements in our solid ink technology, a realtorcan print a postcard of a new listing in full color for the same price asprinting it in black and white, but with 10 times the impact.", "It\u2019s a strategy that\u2019s opening new doors and plays to thesignificant advancements we\u2019ve made in our proprietary solid ink technology,and there\u2019s more to come.", "This launch also included two additions to our series ofcolor laser multi-function systems. We\u2019ve introduced 17 more color productsthis year alone, building on what is already the industry\u2019s broadest portfolioof color printing technology.", "So if you will turn to slide seven, we\u2019ll review ourproduction business. Total production revenue grew 6%, including a four pointbenefit from currency. Post-sale was up 7%. More of our production customersare shifting to operating leases, as mentioned earlier. We saw a four-pointimpact from the shift on production equipment sale revenue. Again, the benefitof operating leases is that the revenue flows through to post-sale over time.", "I am really pleased with the demand for new productslaunched earlier this year, like the Nuvera 288 production systems. The mix ofproducts sold in this space is balancing out, with continuous feed in theNuvera 288 helping to offset declines in other higher end black-and-white productionand light production. And we expect the decline in light production willimprove with the recent launch of the Xerox 4112 and 4127.", "Overall, we remain very well-positioned as the marketcontinues to shift to highlight color ink full color, and that\u2019s what we heardat Graphex the last month. I know some of you were there, too. Ursula was theremeeting with customers and partners who continue to post huge gains in growingtheir digital printing business. The show was a success for Xerox, highlightingthe breadth of our products, workflow, and services offerings, and generatingmulti-million dollar orders, including multiple orders for iGen3s right fromthe show floor.", "We continue to see strong demand for our iGen3 systems, bothin our revenue and install figures. Production color install activity was up14% this quarter.", "So regardless of what our customers are buying, high-end orlight production, color or monochrome, we continue to benefit from theprofitability and production across the board.", "As you know, we typically exclude our developing marketoperations from our production and office revenue results, since DMO is aseparate reporting segment, but with DMO\u2019s expanding growth, I think it isimportant to show the leverage from our strengthened business in areas likeRussia, Central Europe, and more.", "Production equipment sell revenue from DMO was up 16% in Q3,and that\u2019s largely due to more iGen3 and DocuColor sales.", "So if you will turn to slide 8, we\u2019ll take a look at theoffice. With the benefit of Global Imaging in our results, total office revenuewas up 14% in the quarter and 11% in constant currency. Our competitive play toinstall more and more Xerox units helps to boost post-sale, which was up 12% inthe quarter.", "The addition of Global Imaging led to the 18% lift inequipment sales. Global also continues to branch out, making two moreacquisitions this quarter that expand our reach to small and mid-sizedbusinesses.", "Even without the benefit of Global, we saw an improvingtrend in office equipment sales, reflecting a better mix of products sold and aramp-up from the office product launches this year.", "Install activity for segments three through fivemulti-function devices, which are designed for workgroup and mid-sized offices,increased 8%. Demand for our desktop devices in the segments one and two marketdrove up activity 9%, and we saw a 69% increase in installs of our colormulti-function systems. Installs of color printers, a much smaller part of thetotal, were down due to declines in our OEM business.", "We\u2019ve introduced 25 more office products this year, fromsolid ink advancements to a complete refresh of our black and white work centerMSE family, and more color laser based systems.", "It has been a strong launch year for the company, along withcompetitive pricing, breaking down cost barriers of color, and expandingdistribution, and we are seeing positive traction from this aggressive growthstrategy.", "The same holds true in our developing markets business, withoffice equipment sales up 7% in the quarter. So if you will turn to slide 9, wecan provide more details on DMO\u2019s results.", "Revenue from our development markets operations was up 12%with post-sale up 13% and equipment sale revenue up 9%. While office printersand multi-function devices are standard plays in DMO, we are seeing strongersales of production systems this year.", "Commercial printers in countries like Russia and in Centraland Eastern Europe are building their businesses on the advantages of digital,and we\u2019ll have a large showing at next week\u2019s IPEC\u2019s South Asia event, whereXerox's leadership in digital printing is gaining ground in India.", "Not unlike businesses in more developed countries, ourcustomers in DMO are seeking cost-effective ways to simplify the way they dowork and demand for our outsourcing and consulting services is forging valuablepartnerships with clients and providing a boost to DMO post-sale results.", "So here\u2019s a quick wrap-up on the revenue front; annuity,acquisitions, color, services, and activity were the drivers of growth. Nosurprises; just steady, increased improvement across the board and the benefitson the top line were supported by a close eye on managing costs and expandingearnings. So that\u2019s a good place for me to hand it over to Larry. He has moreto share on the dynamics of our post-sale results and a review of ourfinancials. I\u2019ll be back to wrap up and discuss Q4 expectations and then Larry,Ursula, and I will take your questions. Larry.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne and good morning. Our third quarterperformance delivered on our commitment of sustained enhancement of shareholdervalue. Adjusted EPS growth of 17%, 18% year-to-date, $320 million core cashflow, $820 million year-to-date.", "The fundamentals of our business model are strong. Equipmentinstalls had strong growth, annuity revenue growth is driving total revenuegrowth, there is a balance between gross profit margin and expense levels --all of which yielded expanded earnings and good cash generation. The quarterand year-to-date results position us well to deliver on the full year. Slide11.", "Our business model is driven by annuity and our leadingindicators continue on a positive trend. Keep in mind that the machines in thefield, MIF, and page numbers do not include printers, our development marketsegment, or Global Imaging Systems, which would only improve the results.", "Looking first at the top left, digital revenue was up 7%, 4%at constant currency; MIF was up 7%, while digital pages were flat. Thisdigital performance was driven by color growth of 18% revenue, 34% MIF, and 30%pages, combined with the positive influence of color on price per page.", "This remains a huge opportunity going forward, as color onlyrepresents 16% of the MIF and 12% of the pages. These numbers will continue togrow and drive annuity higher.", "In addition, our services annuity, another key indicator andelement of our growth strategy, continues its positive growth at 8%. Black andwhite digital is stable, with slight declines in pages but continued growth inMIF, is a positive indicator for the future.", "The last set of numbers on the bottom related to Light Lens,the analog transition to digital that has put a drag on our post-sale and isnow only 2% of total annuity revenue. This positive story, coupled with theoffice production and DMO installs that Anne reviewed with you, reflect well oncontinued annuity performance. Slide 12.", "The annuity scorecard points to positive post-sale onfinancing revenue growth. Adjusting 2006 for Global, we grew annuity revenues6%, 3% constant currency. The trend of improvement is the key to our businessmodel and at 3% constant currency growth, we are on track for sustainedperformance.", "Digital and DMO annuity drove the growth. DMO has had twoquarters in a row of double-digit growth. Light Lens is now only $47 million inthe quarter and a one point drag on the results. So the metrics in revenueresults point positively and we see annuity going forward, continuing tosupport our business model and cash generation. Slide 13.", "Our P&L for the third quarter delivered solid earningsexpansion of 17% over third quarter 2006 adjusted earnings. We\u2019ve dealt withrevenue, so let\u2019s start with gross profit margin of 40.1, about the same aslast year and in our model range. We grew gross profit dollars significantlythis quarter. Expense ratios improved, with flat RD&E dollars and a declinein SAG, considering currency and Global.", "This quarter, 2006 after tax -- I\u2019m sorry, third quarter2006 after tax adjustments were $68 million for litigation matters, $72 millionrestructuring, and $448 million positive tax audit settlement. With theseadjustments, third quarter 2006 EPS was $0.23 versus $0.27 this year, or 17%growth. Slide 14.", "Cash flow from operations was $286 million in the thirdquarter, $860 million year-to-date, with core cash flow of $320 million and$820 million respectively. Quarter and year-to-date results were driven bystrong earnings and a cash generation from our annuity model.", "This core cash flow performance is on track to reach $1.5billion for the year, the high end of our $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion guidancerange.", "In the third quarter, we paid $197 million into our pensionplans, $158 million in U.S. to achieve 100% funded on a current liabilitybasis.", "Accounts receivable and inventory area an opportunity in thefourth quarter, as our year-to-date results saw increased uses of cash.However, we have consistently performed well in both areas in the fourthquarter, and I expect the same results this year.", "CapEx was $85 million in the third quarter, $247 millionyear-to-date, going to about $300 million for the year. Acquisitions representGlobal and some acquisitions they made in the third quarter. Advectis, themortgage document management services company which we just closed on, willshow up in the fourth quarter.", "On the financing side, we purchased $212 million of shares,$500 million year-to-date. We remain leveraged at 7-to-1 on our financingbusiness, and core debt is $700 million, flat with last quarter. This willdecrease in fourth quarter.", "So overall, I am pleased with the cash results. Slide 15.Looking at year-to-date results has the advantage of smoothing some of thetiming considerations of 90-day periods. Our year-to-date performance is quitegood and the trends support our expectations for delivery of shareholder valueto the full year.", "Our revenue growth shows positive trends on both post-saleand equipment, with post-sale driving total revenue growth. A 40.3% grossprofit margin is on track to deliver between 40% and 41% for the year.", "Good expense management with improved expense to revenueratios and year-to-date adjusted EPS growth of 18%. In addition to our 18%growth in EPS, we delivered $820 million cash from core operations and used$212 million for share repurchase program in third quarter, $501 millionyear-to-date -- $2 billion since inception of the program, with approximately$0.5 billion remaining on our current authorization.", "We continue to leverage our financing business 7-to-1, andbalance share repurchase and acquisition with core cash flow. We just closed onAdvectis for $32 million.", "I am comfortable on the cash side. Given our year-to-dateperformance, we will deliver $1.5 billion core cash, top of our $1.2 billion to$1.5 billion range.", "So in summary, a really good 90-day period, as well asyear-to-date results -- expanding earnings, delivery on cash, and keyindicators pointing positively.", "And now back to Anne.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry. I\u2019ll close with a real quick summary; thisquarter did set the stage for a solid second half of the year, in line with ourexpectations and evidence of the strength of our strategy. The trends are allmoving in the right direction.", "Our top line growth reflects a positive mix of annuityacquisitions and activity. Our success in color and services is giving us greatleverage and generates post-sale revenue. Equipment installs in key markets,especially color and office multi-function, remain strong. The 38 product launchesthis year alone keep us on a steady pace for continued activity growth.", "We\u2019re managing the balance sheet effectively. We\u2019recontinuing to invest in growing our business through innovation andacquisitions, and through stock buy-back, we continue to build more shareholdervalue.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver earnings in therange of $0.39 to $0.41 per share, and for the second time this year, we haveincreased our earnings expectations to $1.18 to $1.20.", "So thanks for listening. Ursula, Larry and I will now takeyour questions.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question will come fromthe line of Jay Vleeschhouwer from Merrill Lynch. You may proceed, Jay.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer -Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. My first question concerns the Globalacquisition. Can you comment on the kind of revenue run-off that you have beenseeing, post the de-certification by Canon and Ricoh of their new product salesthrough that channel? As well, the ability that you\u2019ve had to backfill thatthrough that network with Xerox-branded products, so talk about thattransition, if you could.", "On the services side, you\u2019ve been pursuing these kinds ofmanaged serviced deals for a long time, of course, and you cited two largewins. Has there been a fundamental change in new demand for such contracts? Oryour close rate on the contracts? Or were the two you just announced somewhatanomalous?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "So let\u2019s talk about Global. As I said, we\u2019re really pleasedwith the delivery of Global. Obviously it\u2019s early days, there\u2019s been a lot ofchange for them to absorb, but I have to tell you, their results are on trackand this is really a heck of a management team. There has been no revenuerun-off that we would find concerning or out of trend, despite the fact thatobviously they\u2019ve adjusted to the Canon and Ricoh decision.", "As a matter of fact, I think in reviewing the results on theXerox equipment that now is being delivered through Global channels, by the endof third quarter it was over 50%, which is certainly exceeding our expectationsin terms of how quickly we would be able to integrate Xerox offerings into theglobal channel, and they\u2019re just really bullish about the acceptance andfeedback as it relates to Xerox technology.", "So we are really not at all concerned that Global is notsuccessfully integrating Xerox technology into their customers and I think weare through, quite frankly the beginning days of that transition, so it willjust get better and better.", "On the managed services side, I think there is a lot ofdeals we don\u2019t announce because we\u2019ve obviously got to get permission fromcustomers to announce, so I would not view these deals as anomalies. Weactually now have implemented kind of a big deal bid desk just to deal withbids that are over $20 million or $30 million in a global, very disciplinedway.", "I think certainly our win rate is increasing as we gain moreand more experience, and I think the implementation of this global bid desk isgoing to be very, very helpful, but the fact is that as you close these deals,they become reference points for segments of the industry that I think areabsolutely listening to the Xerox value proposition, and we\u2019ve got demonstratedresults that are reflecting enormous productivity gains and great value forlots of services customers out there. So we\u2019re really I think building on themomentum of what this business has been delivering for the last few years.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer -Merrill Lynch", "Questions for Larry on the operating lease side -- can youcomment on whether you think this phenomenon will grow as a percentage of newbusiness, or might it abate in some way? It does seem to be spreading acrossthe product line in production beyond just iGen. Is it temporary, do you thinkor is it just going to have to become a large piece of the business?", "And then finally, back to Anne, can you comment on overalltrends in your key verticals -- graphic arts, corporate, government, and howyou are doing finally in some of the new production specialty applications?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I would say on the operating lease side, to the extent thatwe are being so successful in services bids and we can solve a lot of customerproblems that way, that we are going to see more operating leases. I think itis definitely a part of our business.", "And it is really a positive. At some point here, there is asteady state where you are getting the benefits in the post-sale side. Rightnow, it is just a way of explaining what is happening in equipment sales, andthat\u2019s why we bring it up. It\u2019s really a really good point for the annuitystream and as it builds up here, it is going to pay off significantly.", "So number one, I think it is going to continue; number two,I think we are going to get huge benefits in post-sale, and I think it is agood thing for the long-term.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I am going to take a general swag at the verticals. I wantto turn it over to Ursula on the -- particularly the graphics art marketplace,but corporate, we\u2019re actually feeling good about it and I know that there\u2019sbeen a lot of questions, particularly on the financial services segment, but Ithink we are differentiated in the sense that these kind of services ledsolutions that provide these clients with substantial productivity and costsavings while we are building more and more value around document managementservices is absolutely continuing to thrive in a world where perhaps there is alot more pressure, just on pure technology acquisition and capital-based acquisition.", "So I think we are positioned well there. So we are notseeing anything in the corporate sector that we haven\u2019t been seeing for thelast three years, and that\u2019s just that corporate clients want a real ROI onwhatever investments they make from technology companies.", "Government has been terrific. A lot of the big breakthroughservices deals like the Department of Works and Pension in the U.K., the Navydeal that we just talked about, government now is beginning to get into the --they want ROI from big time services approaches as well, versus just hardwareacquisition. So I think we are just beginning to open up the governmentopportunities.", "And graphic arts looks great but I\u2019m going to let Ursulatalk about it.", "Ursula M. Burns", "As Anne said, graphics arts does look very encouraging forus. It continues to be a strong segment. It plays extremely well and therefore,we lead with our technology here, both our color technology, which you knowabout. We are really pleased with our performance in the quarter, thirdquarter. By the way, second quarter as well on iGen3, and on our [inaudible]production color product line. iGen performance was very strong. Activity andutilization of our workflow to drive application-specific pages are up as well.", "We are winning and succeeding in the photo market. We aremaking good in-roads in the packaging market, so the production in thecommercial print market is looking very good, the graphic arts market islooking very good.", "If I can also add, our black and white portion of thegraphics art market is strong as well. If you look at our Nuvera EA and ourNuvera 288 systems, they are continuing to be very successful and driveapplications like books and trans promo, and for applications in the commercialprint market as well.", "So this is a quarter, and last quarter as well, that we arevery pleased, very pleased with the activity.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer -Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question will come from the line ofBill Shope from J.P. Morgan. You may proceed, Bill.", "Bill Shope - J.P.Morgan", "Thanks. Anne, despite the operating lease headwind, therewas obviously a nice improvement in equipment sales trends versus last quarter.Could you talk about the sustainability of this improvement? And in adjustingfor Global and currency, should we anticipate that this segment could start toshow some positive growth in coming quarters?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think we are pleased that it really was a nice up-tickfrom Q2 on the equipment sales side. As Larry said, operating lease is a littlebit difficult to predict because it is going to be based on the strength of,particularly of our services business, but that\u2019s one that we are very pleasedabout.", "I think as we look at what really drove the up-tick inequipment sales, it was really strong color performance, so that we expect tocontinue. There is no question that color is the big driver on the equipmentside now for growth and everywhere you look, just about, the performance wasvery, very good.", "So is the improvement sustainable? The answer is yes, and aswe think about the top line equipment sales for the full year, we certainly seeit as an improving trend. Can there be some volatility quarter to quarter basedupon product launches or services content? Yes, but hey, when you look at thisover a few quarters, we expect this trend to improve as color becomes a biggerand bigger part of the overall equipment sale portfolio.", "Bill Shope - J.P.Morgan", "Final question -- are you seeing any competitive pressure orany change in the competitive landscape from Canon\u2019s 7000 series of products?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "No. I think -- well, I should say -- do we see it? Yes.There is a lot of certainly aggression in the marketplace, I think, with regardto trying to place Canon 7000, but I think we have a very entrenched, loyalcustomer base with our DocuColor and iGen customers. And as you can see interms of growth rates on installs, 14%, that\u2019s really an up-tick on installsfor us. The revenue story is great, so I think we are absolutely doing very,very well, in light of competitive entries.", "Ursula, you may want to add.", "Ursula M. Burns", "The one thing I want to add is we launched last quarter, themost recent quarter, DocuColor 8000 AP. This was a product that we worked onspecifically to respond to the one application space that the Canon 7000 wouldhave had an advantage over us, and that\u2019s in heavyweight papers. And we\u2019velaunched that product and it is doing very well.", "So that product, along with our entire product line in theEPC space and production color space, and in the office color space, I think weare, as Anne said, very confident where we are today and definitely confidentfacing off against the Canon line.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "By the way, if you look, the most recent data we have onmarket share, which was Q2 market share, production color, it\u2019s just reallygreat in terms of the improvements we\u2019ve seen both sequentially and year overyear.", "Bill Shope - J.P.Morgan", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come fromthe line of Caroline Sabbagha from Lehman Brothers. You may proceed, Carol.", "Caroline Sabbagha -Lehman Brothers", "Thank you. First, just a very broad question about what youare seeing regionally across the world; are you seeing any sort of slowdown inbids at all, or requests for proposals? Or is the economy continuing to operatethe same level it has in the first half of the year?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think we see the regional trends being pretty similar, andobviously you can see from the results in developing markets that thatcontinues to be the higher source of growth and we are capitalizing on it andwe will continue to do so.", "But I think both in Western Europe and North America, wewould characterize both our signings and our bid pipelines as being as strongas ever. Can there be -- when you are dealing with really big services deals,the reality is they do take longer to close and it\u2019s not a transactionbusiness, but all the indicators would say that our big deal business is goingin the right direction with a pipeline that is as strong as it\u2019s ever been.", "I think we are very much aware, obviously, of the economicchallenges as it relates to the debt markets and the financial servicessegment, but I think that our business model and our business-to-businessorientation is actually keeping us in pretty good shape from feeling any realdownward pressure from that.", "Caroline Sabbagha -Lehman Brothers", "And then, a question on Global Imaging; it looks like if youcan back in to potentially some numbers, that their revenues are up in the lowsingle digits and their equipment sales were down. I know they had an extremelytough compare versus their third quarter last year, so can you address that alittle bit and talk about what you believe trend line is on the Global Imagingrevenue side?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think you characterized it correctly. On the total revenueside, I think we would view it very much on trend. And by the way, pretty goodperformance in light of the early days of change management that they\u2019ve had todeal with with regard to the acquisition.", "On the equipment sales side, for any of those who choose togo back and read 10-Qs, but if you look at the Global 10-Q from third quarterof last year, you would see they had an exceptionally strong performance intheir network services and audio visual groups, which are a small part of thebusiness but it was huge performance, and it created obviously a comparepressure.", "If you look at their core business, we are quite pleasedwith their equipment sale trend on their core business, but they did have adifficult compare and as a result, it actually put pressure on our equipmentsale performance in our core business and actually deteriorate the performancea bit, but underlying fundamentals are good and we continue to be very pleasedwith Global\u2019s performance.", "Caroline Sabbagha -Lehman Brothers", "One last quick question on use of cash. You did a biggerbuy-back in the quarter than I would have guessed. What is the outlook for howmuch you are willing to allocate for the stock buy-back for the rest of theyear, and if we can look out a little bit into \u201908?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "We have $500 million that\u2019s still authorized that we haven\u2019tused, and I would say for the remainder of the year, we plan to be modest. Ithink the third quarter, we just intended -- you know, we just looked at theshare price and bought back shares, so that was the motivation. We thought itwas a good price to buy at. And I think we are going to continue on the trendthat we said at the beginning, which is within cash flow, we\u2019re going to buyback shares.", "And the important factor too is I think by the end of thefourth quarter, we will have paid down a significant amount of our core debt, sowe will be open to go right back on the trend we had before in the next year.", "Caroline Sabbagha -Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come fromthe line of Benjamin Reitzes from UBS. You may proceed, Ben.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes -UBS Warburg", "Thank you. A couple of questions -- I guess you got theeconomy question a lot. Can you just delineate between Europe and the U.S.,please and talk about any differences you saw there in the quarter and into thefourth?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I don\u2019t think we are seeing any real material differencebetween Europe and the U.S. at this point in terms of the markets that weserve. For us, if you look at certainly the strength in the graphic artsmarket, and clearly the corporate value proposition, I think it\u2019s reallyimportant to remember that our go-to-market strategy for significant corporatesectors is now a services led business and I think where you might see someshort-term pressure is more on the capital acquisition side and I think that weare less vulnerable to that than others.", "I do believe that in both Europe and North America, we arenot seeing a lot of pressure and clearly we are watching it very carefully, butnothing that is terribly worrisome in terms of our particular business modelright now.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes -UBS Warburg", "Could we talk about your acquisition strategy, in light ofthat you are still absorbing Global? What kind of acquisitions should we expectfrom Xerox and what do you think of Lexmark? It\u2019s beaten down and there\u2019s somevery bullish views out there by some, but I\u2019m wondering if you would be able toabsorb something like that, or if that would even be on the radar screen?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "First of all, I think in terms of what we\u2019re ready todigest, I mean, Larry said it. We\u2019ll pretty much have digested Global by theend of this year, which I think was a sizable acquisition for us.", "Going forward, we\u2019re real clear -- we are going to continueto look for service verticals that are all, quite frankly, additive, top linedriven kinds of competencies. We are going to look at software that actuallyenhances our production solutions business, and we\u2019re going to look fordistribution. Global was a big bite but there\u2019s lots of other smaller bites outthere and obviously Global continues to digest those on a business as usualfashion.", "As a matter of fact, it\u2019s interesting but their acquisitioncandidate pipeline has never been stronger because of the fact that they arenow have Xerox, the Xerox brands behind them. They are really seeing interestfrom dealers that they would not have seen before.", "I think that the strategy is solid and consistent and willcontinue and be very well-balanced within the capital deployment side.", "I think our principals on acquisitions is really valuecreating, really good revenue synergies, where we can acquire a company andactually use it to drive incremental growth in our core business, so it is nota one-time deal, it\u2019s not a drug that we have to keep doing because it is goingto actually enhance our ability to drive core growth.", "I don\u2019t think Lexmark is an ideal candidate with that kindof view. We have tons of R&D and technology capability. We are not lookingto increment that. Between Fuji Xerox and Xerox, there is nothing the Lexmarkwould bring to the table that would be really value-creating for us.", "And from a distribution perspective, I think it\u2019s muchcheaper and in much better interest of the shareholders to go out and driveadditional indirect distribution and optimize on the Global acquisition, thanwe would want to look for.", "I think that based upon what we\u2019ve been articulating as astrategy, it\u2019s really not a great fit.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes -UBS Warburg", "Thanks for hitting it head on. It was a pretty great,complete answer. Take care.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question will come from the line ofMatthew Troy from Citigroup. You may proceed, Matt.", "Matthew Troy -Citigroup", "I was wondering if you could comment just more broadly noton what you are seeing in the economy -- I think we all look at the same dataand data points, but talk about the business model going forward to 2008? Thisis a much different Xerox than what we\u2019ve seen in past recessions, and to theextent that seems to be the flavor-du-jour in terms of folks\u2019 questions, I waswondering if you could talk about how Xerox is positioned if the economy wereto go into a negative growth, or lack of growth mode.", "I look at the business and I say on the enterprise side,color is a more discretionary spend. I know they reign in our ability to usecolor when costs are tight. And if  lookat the commercial print, which is a new growth market for you folks, that\u2019scorrelated to economic activity over the last 25 years to the tune of about 96%,so you potentially could be vulnerable there. But at the same time, you\u2019vechanged your manufacturing infrastructure.", "I\u2019m wondering if you could just talk about how you thinkabout the economy, how you think about positioning the model, and this is alljust generated basically out of consolidated graphics pre-announcementyesterday, one of the largest commercial printers saying they are starting tosee economic softness.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I actually think that we\u2019ve been investing and positioningthis business to win in tougher and tougher economic conditions in many ways.And that\u2019s come from the relentless focus on productivity and competitiveness,but if look at our strategy going forward, I would say our intent is and youare -- you are seeing it already, you are going to see more of it, is to makecolor more and more affordable.", "We\u2019re going to make it so that people will not point tocolor as something that\u2019s unaffordable, despite the toughest of economicconditions, and obviously what we\u2019ve done now with this solid ink positioningis the beginning of a strategy, Ben, that we intend to have a much broaderimpact with as we go forward.", "So from that perspective, I think our plans for color are tomake it work and be a source of growth by really being responsive to the factthat the more affordable we make it, the better the growth prospects are.", "I\u2019ve talked about our services but if you look at ourservices business right now, driving 8% annuity growth, well above thecorporate average, it is all playing in a world where clients have to maketouch choices about how they spend their dollars and what they focus on, and Ithink our ability to continue to make that value proposition attractive to ourclients by reducing their direct costs and allowing their resources to focus ontheir core business, is really compelling.", "I mean, a lot of our services business now is about notacquiring technology but allowing us to host and manage everything for them,either onsite or offsite. So I think we have solutions to a problem thatclients might face out in the future that are going to be very important.", "And in the production business, if you are going to be asurvivor in the graphic arts business, you better be in digital because thereis no place else to go for growth in value. This is a case where things getweak, you separate out, quite frankly, what the sources of growth andprofitability are from those that quite frankly will be deteriorating, and Ithink that we are well-positioned.", "And when you add it all up, if the going gets tough, thebusiness model you want is an annuity-based business model and 70% of ourrevenues are annuity based and with the impact of services and operatingleases, that will be going up.", "So hey, do we want a stronger economy, do we want the GDP tobe helping propel our growth? Yes, but I think we are prepared to be a winneramong the competitors with regard to the strategy that we have in place.", "Matthew Troy -Citigroup", "I understand that. I didn\u2019t want to sound off alarm bells. Consolidatedsaid both on their call and offline that they intended to continue theirinvestment in digital. I think if you talk to any commercial printer, I wouldagree. It\u2019s becoming just the ante to be in the business, increasingly.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I totally agree and I think look at the product portfoliothat we are bringing to this market and I think this is going to be one of thebiggest strengths we have going forward.", "Matthew Troy -Citigroup", "Second question would just be on again on new marketopportunities; it\u2019s been a couple of quarters since you announced a broaderinterest and focus on photofinishing. I was wondering if you or Ursula couldtalk about the learning curve there, what those discussions are like and maybea hint or a forward-looking statement about what we might see at PMA or in2008, specifically as it relates to your photofinishing push? Thank you.", "Ursula M. Burns", "You know, photofinishing is a focus area for us. In the highend of the business, we have obviously a flagship product, with expanded copyquality capabilities that allow us to participate in the photo imaging marketeven more deeply than we did before.", "We have great examples of this, both in North America and inEurope. In North America, we partnered with Shutterfly, as you know, and inEurope we have a great partnership with MyPhotoFun, with a company called TedGigaprint, so we are actually moving far and moving fast there and trying toexpand our footprint. And I think in the high end of the business, doing well.", "At the lower end, there are applications at the lower endnot as high quality as the iGen or EPC space, and we work through our partners,which is Xerox with FujiFilm, to actually participate there, using some of ouroffice multi-function devices in partnership with FujiFilm to be a kiosk typeprovider. That is a new space for us, a beginning space for us, but one that weare positioned well to continue to grow, especially as we work with FujiFilm,who has a footprint and a deep knowledge there.", "So our technology hardware, our technology software andtheir back-office understanding of how kiosk photo works will help us to beeffective in that space.", "So high end, I think covered, growing well, great technologyimplications; low end, great, working with an expert there with our technology.So we see it as a great opportunity for us going forward.", "Matthew Troy -Citigroup", "Certainly a strong partner with Fuji. If I think about thatas a channel for you to place devices, is this still early days or are you seeingtraction and placements growing to a more material number, or is really an \u201908,\u201909 story where we will see more from you there?", "Ursula M. Burns", "It is definitely still early days but I am not discouragedby the way that the market is moving in the kiosk space. At the high end space,it is not as early days and so the indicators are good there. And the realindicators are good there -- great providers of this type of distributed kindof photo applications, we are partners with some of the best providers in theworld here. So in the high end of the space, it is not early days.", "Matthew Troy -Citigroup", "Thanks, Ursula.", "Operator", "Thank you very much. And your next question will come fromthe line of  Chris Whitmore from DeutscheBank. Chris, you may proceed.", "Chris Whitmore -Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. Larry, can you quantify either theinter-company revenue realized from backfilling the global channel or theincremental equipment margin capture from that backfill? And perhaps talk aboutthe opportunity there going forward?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I don\u2019t think -- you are talking about what we transferthrough Global and what they add to our business? I mean, I think that from thestandpoint of going forward, until we have a lot of product there, it is not amaterial difference but as the products build up, obviously it is going to helpus on total dollars that we get from them. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s publicknowledge.", "It\u2019s just like any channel that we have. I don\u2019t think wepublish what the profitability of those particular channels are, so -- but itis going to be very profitable for us going forward, looking out in time forsure.", "What was the second part of the question, or was that it?", "Chris Whitmore -Deutsche Bank", "I was just trying to get a feel for the manufacturing margincaptured from equipment sales through that Global channel.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a public data number, from a channelstandpoint.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "But obviously it\u2019s one of the things that we pointed to interms of the ability to leverage the acquisition to be more than whatstandalone Global would have brought us. The manufacturing profit is one of thesynergies that over time, will be a real help in improving actually the marginin the company.", "I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your last question will come from the line ofShannon Cross from Cross Research. You may proceed, Shannon.", "Shannon Cross - CrossResearch", "Just a couple of questions; just curious -- have you seenany changes -- this sort of goes back to the economy question -- with regard toany push back of contracts from any of your customers? You know, how whenthings slow down, you tend to push back contracts and not sell as much product.It doesn\u2019t appear that that was the case this quarter, but I just wanted toconfirm.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "When you say push back on contracts, you mean in terms ofdeals signed?", "Shannon Cross - CrossResearch", "Actually lengthening out the contracts. So your salespersongoes in and says okay, fine, I know times are a little bit tough, let\u2019s stretchout the contract another year and you benefit on the margin side because --", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I see. You know, I would not say that that\u2019s any different-- I mean, we do go and think it\u2019s to an advantage, sometimes, if we can extendthe contract for the client. It tends to be the timeframe where it is mostproductive for the client and what\u2019s profitable for us, there\u2019s no questionabout it.", "So that\u2019s kind of a strategy that we have in place, but Idon\u2019t think we are seeing anything that would be materially different in termsof the economic impact.", "Shannon Cross - CrossResearch", "Okay, good, and then Larry, maybe you can talk just a littlebit more in terms of the use of cash. You\u2019ve talked about repurchase, you\u2019vetalked about acquisitions -- any comments on dividends or any thought processwith regard to looking out and how you evaluate the various uses?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I think as we\u2019ve said before, and I think we\u2019ll cover inmore detail at our investor conference, we consider that in the future, Xeroxwill be a dividend company and it\u2019s just a question of when that will happen.", "I think going forward, you are going to see a significantamount of share buy-back. You are going to see acquisitions, as Anne outlined,probably not anywhere near the size of a Global Imaging, and then I think atsome future date, we will be a dividend company and I think we will cover moredetail on that when we go through it at the investor conference.", "Shannon Cross - CrossResearch", "Okay, sounds good. I guess we\u2019ll all see you in November.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Great. That\u2019s my parting line, Shannon, because I wanted tothank all of you for joining us and we do hope that we see as many of you as possibleat our investor conference. It is in New York on November 19th and thank youvery much for your participation today.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation intoday\u2019s presentation.

She is joined by Ursula Burns, President; and Larry Zimmerman, Executive Vice President, and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor.  At the request of Xerox Corporation today\u2019s conference call will be tape recorded.  Other taping and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.  After the presentation, there will be a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)", "During this conference call Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain.  Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time I would like to turn the meeting over to Mrs. Mulcahy.  Mrs. Mulcahy, you may begin.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you Lauren, and thanks to all of you for joining us today.  If you will turn to slide four, we will provide you with summary of our fourth quarter performance.  We delivered Q4 EPS of $0.41 at the high end of our guidance resulting in full year earnings growth of 13%.  It is consistent, steady momentum that reflects the effectiveness of our annuity based business.", "Total revenue including the benefit of acquisitions was up 11% this quarter to $4.9 billion.  Post sale revenue, which accounts for about 70% of our total revenue, grew by 12% lead by a steady pace of install activity, color, and document services.  And currency gave us a 4 point benefit.", "New color products and high take volume from Xerox color systems continued to generate positive results.  Color revenue grew 14% in the quarter and it now represents 40% of total revenue.", "Our gross margins were 40.5% in the fourth quarter, down about half a point from Q4 \u201906 and in our range of expectations for the year.  Selling, administrative, and general expenses were 24.3% of revenue, up about a point.", "Our balance sheet remains exceptionally solid.  The closure from our annuity resulted in significant operating cash flow.  We generated $1 billion in Q4 alone and $1.9 billion for full year 2007.", "And we used our financial strength in 2007 to build value for shareholders to $631 million in stock buy-backs, declaring a dividend, and investing in growth by funding $1.6 billion in accretive acquisitions.  And our board just approved another $1 billion for share repurchase.", "So we are heading into 2008 with the benefit of a stronger business.  The industry is [inaudible] for technology and document services, and significantly expanded distribution to businesses small to large.  We operate a global business with more than half of our revenue generated from customers outside of the US.  From the small and medium businesses, and the public sector, to the large enterprises, and commercial printers, we serve a wide range of markets, giving us diversification globally and in market scope.", "We are seeing steady improvement from our operations in Europe, and the key developing markets like Russia, Eastern Europe, and India.  Most importantly that is a benefit for the healthy annuity stream.  With recurring revenues and a disciplined approach to managing cost, we remain committed to delivering on our 2008 full year EPS guidance of $1.31 to $1.35.", "Larry Zimmerman is going to provide you with more details on our financial position in a couple of minutes.  Ursula Burns is also with us this morning and we will all take your questions in a bit.  So if you will turn to slide five, we will have our overview of your fourth quarter revenues.", "With Global Imaging in our core business, we are competing aggressively to increase tightness in Xerox systems through new products and expanded distribution.  The growth in the install activities is a direct driver of increased annuity.  And we saw the benefit of this trend continue in Q4.", "This chart shows the year-over-year compare and actual cost in currency.  The adjusted column on the right assumes that Global\u2019s revenue for Q4 \u201906 is included in our results for the same period.", "Again total revenue was up 11% in the quarter to $4.9 billion.  When we adjust to compare for Global Imaging, revenue was up 5% with 4 points of positive currency.  Equipment sales were flat in the quarter, adjusted for Global Imaging, and down 4% in cost of currency.", "However, the more significant revenue driver, post sale was up 12% in the quarter.  Adjusting for global and the benefit from currency the post sale was up 3% in Q4 continuing the positive trend and reflecting the clearest picture of growth for our company.  In fact, we added more than $1 billion to our annuity stream for 2007 including the benefit of Global Imaging.", "So we remain quite confident that our annuity based business model is working.  The focus on increasing activity through both our core business and acquisitions is generating more pages printed on Xerox systems.  And of course these pages translate into post sale dollars that continue to fuel our business for the long term.", "At the same time we are growing annuity revenue through multi-year, multimillion dollar services contracts.  In 2007 services generated $3.4 billion in annuity revenue, an 8% increase over 2006.  By targeting more document intensive vertical markets, like healthcare, legal and financial services, we grew the value of services signed by 18% last year.  Color was also a highlight in our revenue story, and gives a big boost to our annuity.", "So if you will turn to slide six, we will take a look.  With color, the power is always in the pages.  This past year more than 40 billion pages were printed on Xerox color systems.  That\u2019s an increase of 30% over 2006.  We are miles ahead of our competitors on color pages.  But most importantly, pages remain the best source of our double-digit color annuity growth.", "Color page volume was up again this quarter, growing 34%.  It now represents 14% of total pages that is 4 points more than Q4 of 2006.  Revenue from color this quarter was up 14%, which includes a 6 point currency benefit.  Again we are seeing the benefit of our annuities here with total sale from color up 17% in the quarter.  And that is without factoring any benefit from Global Imaging.  Color now accounts for 40% of our total revenue, but only 14% of our total pages, indicating a tremendous opportunity for Xerox going forward.", "Last year we made a strategic move in solid inks that made the cost of printing the color pages affordable as black-and-white.  And we have broadened our color portfolio with 18 new products.  We will continue fortifying our leadership position in color this year, steadily growing the number of pages printed on Xerox color systems.", "Now if you will turn to slide seven, we will take a look at our production business.  Color production revenue grew 5% including a 6 point benefit from currency.  Equipment sale revenue was down 4%.  Again the focus here is on post sales where we see the benefit of tremendous page volume.", "Xerox production systems generate the most digital color pages in the entire industry and that is fueling the 9% growth in our production annuity.  And it is a leading indicator for strong production revenue growth going forward.", "We saw accelerated demand for the DocuColor 7000 and 8000AP series in Q4, as well as continued growth for the new Xerox Nuvera system.  This growth only partially offset declines in our light production business, which will be a key focus area for the company in 2008.  We know we can do better in light production.  We have broadened the portfolio and are offering customers more choices at more price points in the important segment six markets.", "The success of Xerox iGen3 continues to lead the industry in digital color production, printing and in pages.  We have now installed over 2000 systems worldwide.  Of those, 126 iGen customers are printing more than a million pages per month on their systems, and 275 customers now own more than one iGen3 to continue boosting their digital color businesses.  As the market for photo applications continues to grow you will see Xerox continue to make strides in this industry and be partnered with companies like Fuji Film to expand our footprint in imaging.", "We are also aggressively targeting the digital continuous feed market with the recent announcement of color, and black-and-white systems.  Our innovation in this space redefines the standard for speed and quality, and gives Xerox competitive advantage as demand grows.  Production sales are also on the rise in developing markets, up 11% alone in Q4.", "If you will turn to slide eight we will review the office segment.  With the benefit of Global Imaging in our results, total office revenues were up 14% in the quarter and 9% in cost in currency.  Our competitive play to install more and more Xerox units helped to boast post sales which was up 13% in the quarter and will continue to be a driver of total office revenues.", "Equipment sales were up 16%.  The acquisition of Global Imaging has more than met our expectations.  They continue to expand their business acquiring four more companies in the short time that they have been part of Xerox with more to come.  More than 50% of the document technology they sell is now Xerox, significantly expanding Xerox\u2019s presence in small and mid-size business markets.  Consider that just a year ago, Global Imaging didn\u2019t sell any Xerox devices.  With more than half of their equipment sales now carrying the Xerox brand, we see a strong return on this investment.", "While activity was up 6% for office black-and-white MFD\u2019s, it soared for color multi-function.  Installs were up 67% in Q4, 65% for the full year, largely due to the success of our WorkCentre and DocuColor families and continued demand for our new solid ink systems.", "2007 was a very strong product launch year, 39 new products that garnered more than 190 awards.  And we are ready for a similar aggressive launch schedule this year.  It is all about increasing activity and annuity through new technology in services, expanding distribution, and growing our presence in developing markets.  We are clearly seeing the benefits.", "In quarter four office equipment sales were up 4% in developing markets.  If you will turn to slide nine we will take a closer look at the developing markets.  Revenue from our developing markets operations is up 14% with post sale up 18%, and equipment sale revenue up 6%.", "As I mentioned in the production and office overviews, DMO sales growth has an increasingly more significant influence on our overall performance.  Growth is largely driven from our stronger presence in Eurasia, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.  While our install activity is weighted towards products for small and mid-size businesses, we are seeing increasing growth for our production devices and higher end multi-function systems to benefit the emerging market\u2019s leapfrogging technology.", "So in summary, annuity, acquisitions, color, and services were all key drivers of growth in Q4 and for full year 2007.  Our investments in innovation and expanded distribution opened new markets for us, and strengthened our brand.  As a result we have built a global business that succeeds through recurring revenues, with steady margins generating significant operating cash flow.", "And that is a good place for me to hand it over to Larry.  He has more to share on the dynamics of our post sale results and a review of our financials.  And I will be back to wrap up and discuss Q1 expectations, and then Larry, Ursula and I will take your questions.  Larry?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne, and good morning.  Fourth quarter results continue our earnings expansion and cash generation performance.  13% adjusted EPS growth for the year, and $2.1 billion of core cash flow generation driven by earnings.  These results coupled with a positive trend and growth of our annuity revenue stream position us well for 2008.  In addition to the annuity model, our broad set of products, and our global diversified customer base provide us the confidence that our model will continue to yield.", "Slide eleven; we have an annuity business model that provides a consistent and profitable stream of revenue that drives strong cash flow.  The leading indicators for our annuity continue on a positive trend.  As we go through the scorecard keep in mind that machines in the field (MIF), as well as page data, do not include printers or developing market segment or Global Imagining Systems (NYSE:GIS), and all revenue measures exclude GIS.  Inclusion of these items would improve the results.", "Starting in the top left box, for the full year digital revenue was up 7%, 4% of cost in currency.  MIF also was up 7%, and digital pagers were flat.  And if we were to look at fourth quarter itself, digital revenue was actually up 5% cost in currency.  MIF was up 7%, and pagers were up 1%.", "Color continues to drive growth with 18% revenues, 35% MIF, and 31% page growth.  This growth, combined with the positive impact of color on price per page, makes this a huge opportunity in 2008 and beyond as color represents only 17% of MIF and 12% of the pages.", "Black-and-white digital is stable with slight declines in pages, but continued growth in MIF.  Along with our strong color growth is a positive indicator for future annuity.  And light lens, the analog transition to digital that has put a drag on post sale revenue is now down to only 2% of our total annuity revenue.", "We also continue to see strong growth in another of our key growth strategies, services.  Services annuity is up 8% for the year and that is compared to 1% growth in \u201905, and 6% growth last year.  There remains strong demand from our customers to have Xerox help them optimize and simplify their document processes while lowering their costs.  These leading indicators as well as our performance in DMO and Global reflect well on continued annuity performance.", "Slide twelve, the annuity scorecard points to positive post sale and financing revenue growth.  And as this chart shows the trend also indicate positive growth for the future.  Adjusting 2006 for Global, we grew annuity revenue 7%, 3% in cost in currency.  The trend of improvement reflects the effectiveness of our business model and a 3% cost in currency growth we continue to not only sustain but to improve performance.", "Digital and DMO annuity are the largest contributors to growth.  The digital growth is driven by color and services.  DMO has had three quarters in a row of double-digit growth built on strong product placements through their tier two channel.  Light lens was only $46 million in the quarter and one point drag on results.  Though the metrics in revenue transport positively, we believe annuity going forward will continue to drive our business model in cash generation.", "Slide 13; now let\u2019s take a look at the fourth quarter P&L as well as the full year.  Anne and I have covered revenue so let\u2019s go to the key ratios.  Gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was 40.5%, right in the middle of our model range of 40-41%.  Margin had a tough year-over-year two tier on the quarter as mix of products in growth segments varied driven by strong growth in DMO\u2019s, services, and office.  We see much less variation for the full year of gross profit margin, 40.3-40.6%.", "We believe quarter-to-quarter, 40-41% is the correct model range to run our business.  RD&E was down on a ratio basis, but our investment was basically flat in dollars for the quarter and the year.", "Our SAG ratio for the quarter increased as we continued to make distribution systems and marketing investments in our business.  Full year SAG ratio improved slightly.  The dollar growth in SAG was primarily caused by currency and not having Global in 2006 results.", "Net income grew slightly in the quarter.  Leading to tough gross profit compares as well as lower OID last year into the headquarter sale and lower \u201907 interest income.  Full year net income grew 8%.  The tax rate was a slight help compared to \u201906 for the quarter, and was a negative for the full year compared to \u201906.", "Equity income grew $8 million in the fourth quarter but was down $17 million for the year due to Fuji Xerox restructuring.  For the quarter EPS grew 8% to $0.41 versus $0.38 on an adjusted basis, and full year 13% earnings expansion to $1.19 versus $1.05 on an adjusted basis.", "The bottom of the slide adjusts for fourth quarter 2006 and full year exactly as we did it in last year\u2019s report taking out one-time items, favorable tax audit benefit, restructuring, and a charge for litigation matters.  There were no adjustments for any quarters in 2007.", "Even normalizing for Global, gross profit grew significantly in \u201907, and along with good expense performance, was a primary driver of earnings growth.  This operational performance along with share repurchase delivered 13% earnings expansion for the year, delivering on our commitment to shareholders.", "Slide 14, our cash flow performance for the quarter and the year was outstanding, over $2 of cash flow per share.  Cash flow from core operations was $1.3 billion in the quarter and $2.1 billion for the full year.  It was driven by our earnings and shows the cash generation capacity of our annuity driven business model.", "We also had extremely good working capital execution.  Accounts receivable, inventory, and payables were all managed well.  Full year cash from investing was driven by our acquisition of Global Imagining and Advectus, and $359 million of CAPEX in internal use software.", "Cash from financing was all about short-term borrowing from Global and paying it off as of year end, and trading secured for unsecured debt.  Our cash flow gave us the ability to acquire Global, a great company, pay for it in a little over two quarters.  And at the same time repurchase 631 million in shares with a $1.1 billion balance, and about the same level of debt 12/31/07 as 12/31/06.", "Given these results, the board of directors authorized a total of $1.37 billion for share repurchase, $1 billion new, $370 million remaining from the prior authorization.  In the first quarter we expect to aggressively buy shares.  We are also raising our full year outlook on core cash flow from about $1.6 billion to $1.8-2 billion.", "This a perfect slide to finish my comments on because it demonstrates one of the key strengths of our annuity model, cash.  We are confident we can deliver expanded earnings and with our cash generation, we have all the tools to grow our business and deliver to our shareholders.", "Thank you and now I will give it back to Anne.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry.  So to wrap it up, we had a very good year and a very solid quarter.  Our performance in 2008 will be driven by strong, profitable annuity, built by color and services it continues the business model discipline.  The resiliency of this model and the execution capabilities of our teams will deliver double-digit earnings growth and significant operating cash flow.  And with our strong balance sheet we will focus even more on share repurchase.  We will be opportunistic in making acquisitions.", "So in short, here is why I am confident Xerox will increase value for shareholders.  We are an investment grade, global firm serving diverse markets.  We are an annuity based business that continues to boost recurring revenues.  We are generating strong cash flow.  We are investing in our business and in our stock.", "And we are well positioned to build on this solid momentum in 2008.  So for Q1, we expect to deliver earnings in the range of $0.25 to $0.28 per share.  And we remain firm in our guidance to deliver full year earnings in the range of $1.31 to $1.35.", "Thanks for listening.  Now Larry, Ursula and I would be pleased to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  And your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Yes, good morning.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Good morning, Shannon.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Just a few questions, Anne, maybe you can provide some context a minute.  The digital page growth, the pages where you are now flat, can you provide some context on how that has trended over the last few years just to give us an idea of how it meets up with the improvement in the machines in the field.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Yes, absolutely.  If you look at 2006 and where we ended up, you would have seen that total pages were negative.  They would have been down 2%.  If you look at where we come from there up until third quarter \u201907, they were down 1%.  Q4 \u201907 is the first time that digital pages have turned flat.  And that is really driven by the color page growth of 34% color page growth.  So, we are pleased that we have turned the corner on that but when you get your population growing and your pages growing, this is a science.  And it drives annuity growth.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, and then as we look at pricing because obviously there has been pressure on pricing on the equipment side.  Can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing out there and then I think that [Icon] just talked about some pretty aggressive pricing in black-and-white equipment on their calls.", "And then also on the page side, what were the [inaudible] especially color pages?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "So I would look and say that pricing really didn\u2019t change a lot for us in terms of price investments.  We have been basically talking about a 5-10% range of price investments, literally the last few years.  And we saw the same exact kind of price investments in Q4.  So, I think that we would suggest that we see actually deeper discounts on the color side than the black-and-white side.  But when you add it all up, its 5-10% and we\u2019ve not seen any significant shift in terms of price.  And that is the equipment pricing investment.", "On the page pricing, very consistent, we see declines in the price per color page but no accelerating trend in price declines.  And obviously we are part of the driver of that, particularly when you look at color from the price of black-and-white, our investment in color page pricing is going to accelerate the adoption of color.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay and then one final question just in sort of a macro sample because I\u2019m sure that there is going to be lots of questions on the economy.  [Inaudible] in the quarter, any fall-off?  Again the comments out of [Icon] were that they saw some push-back on large deals at the end of the quarter.  Anything that lead you to believe that things were slowing down?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think that we had some mixed signals, obviously, because of the diversity of our business.  So we don\u2019t see the same concentration as other businesses do in specific segments or geographies.  I think that we saw, perhaps, a little bit of a slow down in some of the corporate environments.  But on the other hand, we\u2019re really pleased with our services signings which full year grew 18% with a very strong fourth quarter in services signings.  So, clearly I think that we had some mixed signals.", "By the way, Global had a very, very good fourth quarter.  And so the small and medium-sized business environment was staying quite robust.", "You would have seen an increase in activity in color printing for us from the previous quarter as well.  And that is not just OEM, but our own branded color printing business was up 7%, which is quite a nice bounce back from some of those declines we have seen in color printing.", "So, I would call it mixed at best, I guess.  And for us because of the diversity of our segments and our geographies, and the annuity based business, we were not linked to any particular aspect of the economy that would have been a big issue for our results.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Bank of America.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America Securities", "Hi, thanks guys for the question.  Just to start off on operating margins, came in a little bit lighter than we had modeled.  Just wondering sort of the blend and then the different product areas came in a little bit lighter pretty much across the board than had modeled.  Just wondering if this is sort of consistent with what you are expecting going into the quarter and maybe our forecast was just a little on the heavy side.", "And then if in fact margins did come in a little bit lighter than you had expected, reiteration of the full year guidance, might we think about sort of the way that we get there is changing slightly versus when you guys provided the forecast back in November.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay, so let me talk about margins a little bit.  The first thing that I would probably look at and say, in our business sometimes 90 days presents some anomalies and I would say that if you looked at Q4 \u201906 it was the high point for margin of the year.  It was a very, very strong quarter.", "So it was a tough compare.  And that is why we were not surprised or disappointed with margin, simply because it was within our range.  And if anything the strength, in particularly our DMO and our services business kind of would dictate that that range is one that we think is reasonable for our business.", "So nothing, I think, surprising about it to us.  And clearly probably the biggest factor was just the strength of Q4 \u201906 margin which was kind of above the range that we normally expect.", "In terms of full year guidance, obviously we have reaffirmed our full year guidance.  Once again I think that we can look at it and say that if you look at the percentage of earnings delivered quarter-by-quarter, 2008 will be a pretty consistent year for us.  Although 2007, our first quarter was particularly strong as well.  But having said that, the range of guidance that we are presenting is certainly very consistent with the kind of earnings growth that we expect and it absolutely is supportive of the full year guidance that we are delivering.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America Securities", "Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.  I guess along the same lines, is it still reasonable to assume that you would expect some operating margin expansion for the full year 2008?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Yes, I think that we have basically set a goal 10-12% operating margin and making steady progress if you look at where we ended up in 2006 full year.  Was it 8.7%, we improved that by half a point to 9.2%.  So we still think that there is opportunity there.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America Securities", "Okay, great, thank you.  And then just quickly one thing if I could, post sale, post sale growth trends certainly appear to remain flat, perhaps to even improve on the margin.  It\u2019s interesting if you look at production post sale versus production equipment growth, it looks like production equipment was down a little bit more relative the last couple of quarters.  And I\u2019m just interested in getting your take on if anything has changed in production equipment this quarter versus the last couple of quarters.  And then maybe in office equipment as well, and if so, do you think that might be indicative, or what it may be indicative of?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well if we kind of look at production business in Q4, we were really pleased with Nuvera and continuous feed.  So the high end of production was strong and we performed very well.  Our soft spot was light production.  We brought new products in the market and we didn\u2019t have the full attraction in the quarter.  We think we can do better in light production.  But that really was, if there was a \u201clight\u201d part of the production business, it would have been in black-and-white light production.", "Our color production full year was fabulous.  Q4 2006 was like outside the realm of fabulous.  We really skewed most of our activity to Q4 \u201906.  This was a little bit more balanced, but we still grew color production installs by 3% in the fourth quarter.  And then we look at it full year and say to grow pages by over 30% to get to 40 billion color pages is really what we look at in terms of want for health of the business.", "So, nothing there that would be alarming because we do think that we have some catch up on the black-and-white light production side that would have improved the overall equipment sale performance in the production business.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America Securities", "Okay, great, thank you.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with UBS.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Hey Ben.", "Benjamin Reitzes - UBS", "You had some mixed signals in the economy et cetera and obviously I would like to hear a little bit more about that by geo, because I don\u2019t think we have a Europe number in here. Maybe we do and I didn\u2019t see it?  That is the first part of the question.", "The second part is with regard to keeping your guidance for the year and with the back drop of mixed signals in the economy in the corporate space, it looks like you are going to increase the pace of  your share buybacks is not only because of the good cash flow, but because of where the stock price is and the authorization.", "So, is the share buyback necessary to hit the guidance, is it incremental? I mean this a back door way of asking the EBIT question. Do we have a year where you missed EBIT, but you hit earnings because of these mixed signals?  So that\u2019s the long question.  I have a follow-up on color.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Let me just start on economy, and then I will turn it over to Larry just on the position of share buyback and how it influences earnings.  When I look at economy, I would look at it and say we saw strength in Europe.  We don\u2019t break out Europe specifically but there was nothing that we saw in Europe that wasn\u2019t a continuing trend of good results, great strength in our developing markets led by Eastern Europe and Eurasia.  Very good performance in our US channels and global, and a little bit of softness in the corporate environment, but once again the services pipeline and services signings were very strong.", "When you add that all up, we can clearly still deliver good performance even if there is a little bit of softness in the corporate environment.", "But, Ben, our business is really interesting, because a lot of it\u2019s not capital acquisition any longer, it\u2019s operating lease.  Our services contracts are ways for our clients to reduce expenses, which quite frankly plays well to a weakening economy.  So we think we can play to our strength and we feel very confident then about being able to deliver the earnings even with perhaps a little uncertainty in the economy.  That\u2019s the way we\u2019ve have assessed it.", "Larry, on share buyback?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Ben, on share buyback, I think I would say, number one that our plan was always to be very aggressive on share repurchase given that we sort of traded off between Global Imaging and share repurchase in 2007.  The first point is we always were going to be very aggressive.  I think the share price just makes it, if you could be more aggressive, you will be more aggressive; you do have limits on how much you can actually buy compared to the volume in the marketplace.", "So it is aggressive.  I think we are planning on profit growth and we are still planning on profit growth.  We have not adjusted that in any way.  If we are able to be a little bit more aggressive on share repurchase, it will help us.", "Benjamin Reitzes - UBS", "Just it\u2019s hard to say right now, I guess, whether it means there is upside to the guidance with it if you increase the pace I guess and the trade-offs?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I think there is over 11 months of actuals to go.", "Benjamin Reitzes - UBS", "Just on color, if I take out currency growth of 8%, with all of the crosscurrents with what\u2019s coming out of Ikon  I want to make sure that that\u2019s in line with your expectations and what you think the long-term growth rate is for color.", "Also iGen, you gave an interesting number of 2,000 installs.  If I take five-and-half years, that\u2019s roughly on average of 360 units per year.  I know early on in its life you had goals for 300, and then maybe even took that to 500 at one point.  Is iGen meeting expectations and is it a growing business to what you thought, going in?", "Am I reading it right that it\u2019s kind of at a run rate of 360, now you have a lower priced product. Given the goals early on were to be 300 and now maybe on a 360 run rate, am I looking at this right, am I looking at it wrong? Is iGen actually growing faster than that 8%?  What is your view on that 8% just going forward on an organic kind of color growth rate if currency were to take itself out of the equation long-term?", "Anne Mulcahy", "I\u2019m going to have Ursula address maybe iGen first and then color.", "Ursula Burns", "So iGen, Ben, is on a growing rate.  The 2,000 installs that we have achieved are at or beating our expectations.  We are very very pleased with the iGen install rate, but also the iGen average monthly page rate.  You can\u2019t really just take the 2,000 and divide it by the number of years that we have been selling it.  Clearly, the back end years we sell more than we did in the beginning years.  So, iGen is exceeding our expectations both on installs and on AMPV, average monthly page volume.", "Benjamin Reitzes - UBS", "Thanks.  So it\u2019s growing faster than your color average or you don\u2019t want to get that granular?", "Ursula Burns", "No, it is growing faster than our color average for sure.", "Anne Mulcahy", "And color, just color in total, we look at the color growth rate, we were quite pleased.  I mean, one of the things that\u2019s even more important than just the activity rate in color growth is page rate growth.  If you look at the page rate growth, it actually accelerates.  I mean with 31% growth rate full-year \u201807 and 32% in Q3\u201907 and 34%, this quarter.  So, where we make our money is in the pages and pages have accelerated.  Clearly we are making some investments on the equipment side to make sure we get the placements out there.  So, you got to look at really two things I think in that;  post-sale and pages and we are really pleased with the pace in both of those.", "Benjamin Reitzes - UBS", "So the high single digits? I\u2019m just trying to I guess get a feel for if we took currency out of the equation and just taking all the comments from all of these other companies that are much more negative than yours, what kind of growth rate is color? It sounds like you are saying it\u2019s still kind of close to where you reported and that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to get out of you.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Absolutely, we\u2019ve been consistently growing double-digit at constant currency with just slightly below that in Q4, but it came off a wildly successful Q4 \u201806 and so I don\u2019t think there is anything in absolute terms that we are not pleased with in terms of color contribution right now.", "Ursula Burns", "Including the go-forward opportunity, it\u2019s only still 14% of the pages are color, so there is still a large amount of opportunity ahead of us.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Carol Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you.  I am just trying to marry what you said you are seeing in the broader market and what your equipment sales number showed, which was a little weaker than what we thought and I think you had easy compares. The weakness didn\u2019t seem to be as much in the office where I would guess you would see more the corporate spending but in production. Would you characterize what you saw in production and you touched upon light production as more internal or external factors that drove it?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think we would definitely characterize it as more internal, because the weakness for us was black-and-white light production, Carol, and I think that was more product-driven.  Our growth in both Nuvera and continuous feed, particularly continuous feed by the way where we are now installing our new black-and-white systems was quite healthy and we were very pleased with it.", "If I look at color production, we grew installs but I do think that was virtue of a very difficult compare on production color year over year, because we look at the growth rates on production color for the full year and just the pace of activity that we were quite comfortable.", "I should also mention operating leases where we have been kind of accelerating the use of operating leases, which is a great way quite frankly to accelerate placements without capital acquisition on the part of the customer; it costs us at about 2 points of equipment sale in the production market and nothing in the office market.  So in order to get the placements, we\u2019ve used more operating leases in the production market but that\u2019s really we think a very smart strategy, because it\u2019s terrific for production annuity.", "So with the new products on the light production side, we think we can bring back better equipment sale performance on production.  But overall, there was nothing that we thought was really market-driven or economy-driven that we would point to.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Looking at a little bit on the negative that these products don\u2019t take hold in the market, could you make your numbers for the year with equipment sales ex global, ex currency sort of down in that 4% range that you saw in the fourth quarter?", "Anne Mulcahy", " ", "I think that our business model with over 70% of revenues in annuity, I mean, clearly gives us the opportunity to weather volatility in equipment sales much more than other companies.  The other piece is that we have a very disciplined approach with the business model.  We know how to clearly get productivity, reduce cost, and manage in a tougher environment.", "So clearly as Larry said, we are one month into the year.  We don\u2019t have a ton of visibility, but we do know how to manage this business model and deliver bottom-line results.   I think that\u2019s a great advantage of having an annuity-based business.", "So can we weather continue pressure in the equipment sale area?  Yes, but remember this well that we will be looking in a much more focused way on activity versus equipment sale.  What I would look for and really watch is kind of the activity numbers, which we think have been quite strong and which really are the indicators of continued wholesale strength.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Going to the annuity scorecard on Page 11, just if you look at the three boxes you put on top, digital MIF is up, color MIF is up and black-and-white digital MIF is up but in all those three, the pages are down more than the MIF.  Should I assume that underlying what\u2019s happening in your MIF is a little bit of a mix to lower and equipment overall and then trying to marry that with your digital revenues that are stronger than the page the growth for most of it except for color are on black-and-white at least is the price per page actually increasing? I don\u2019t know from reading these things from those three boxes, I guess?", "Anne Mulcahy", " ", "Clearly, price per page is increasing and that\u2019s due to the mix of color.  So there is no question that with the MIF penetration we have in color now, I think something like 19% of the MIF is now colored as we continue to improve that, the price per page is going to go up.  So that\u2019s an absolute scenario.", "On the pages versus the MIF, I mean it depends; if you look at for example, black-and-white digital MIF, I think you will find a lot of that in kind of A4 and low-end driven and clearly and even light production quite frankly, a little bit of a pages will not grow as fast as the MIF, because of the mix there.", "I think in color you\u2019ll find it, it moved back and forth quite frankly, but color is much closer, I mean the strength of our production color business is keeping the MIF growth and the color page growth much closer together and that\u2019s where we want it, because that\u2019s where the money is.  I think it would be yes on the black and white side, but not really on the color side.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "One last quick question, your overall MIF for the parts of the company that you measure, I presume that was up year-over-year, but rough percentages?", "Anne Mulcahy", " ", "Overall MIF is up 2%, digital MIF is up 7%, and color MIF is up about 35%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bill Shope \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Bill Shope - JP Morgan", "I have a few questions. Anne, first I want to dig a little more into the macro area, I know obviously we\u2019ve seen a lot of questions there, but I think there are still a lot of concerns there.", "Obviously, I think your commentary and your results suggest that you didn\u2019t see any issues on a macro basis for the December quarter and I think we\u2019ve heard similar commentary out of other large companies that are exposed to the US corporate space.", "But I think the obvious concern from investors out there is that we could be facing pretty rapid deceleration in spending levels in \u201808 and that\u2019s obviously always hard to see.", "Now Anne, in your conversions with your customers, are you getting any sense that their budgets are being impacted due to macro concerns or that budgets are maybe a bit more fluid at this time of the year than they have been in years past?", "Anne Mulcahy", " ", "What I hear from customers is pretty consistent with what I\u2019ve been hearing from customers in the last few quarters and that is the ability to do business under a services contract versus just a capital acquisition contract is preferable in large enterprises, because you can actually reduce overall bottom line spend.  The services businesses clearly is faring well in an environment where perhaps, capital expenditures are coming under a little bit of pressure.", "The second piece is that, in particularly in the graphic arts marketplace which is really strong for us, the ability to do operating leases is enabling the graphic arts marketplace to get into quite frankly, the digital technology side of this without big capital expenditure.  So I think that is a big help.", "The other thing is,  and global is a great indicator for us because it\u2019s a small and medium size market, they had a fourth quarter that quite frankly was on their trend even prior to the Xerox acquisition in terms of growth.  We were really pleased with the fact that they actually did not reduce sales at all and didn\u2019t see anything that put any pressure on their business.", "So all in all, I think if we are seeing perhaps some pressure on the capital acquisition side, that we are prepared to provide clients alternatives that they find attractive in that kind of environment.", "Bill Shope - JP Morgan", "On the annuity stream, obviously your significant exposure to an annuity stream is the key reason why the model is at least somewhat counter cyclical if we do get into tough times. Can you helps us understand within the annuity stream outside of fixed contracts, how much of that annuity stream is based on activity that could be somewhat sensitive to the economic conditions? From what you have seen in the past.", "Anne Mulcahy", " ", "I would say all of the annuities, with the exception perhaps of just individually purchased supplies is under four and five year contracts for the most part; certainly three to five years and  lot of our supplies are now bundled along with financing into a single contract.  So the vast majority of the annuity are revenues under contract for multiple years.", "We talked about a services business that\u2019s now reached $3.5 billion that would be characteristic of a long-term contractual relationship.  We finance the great majority of our business, so our financing contracts are also multiyear generally three to five year contracts.  As I said, a lot of our supplies business is now is bundled into those kinds of contracts.", "The answer is it\u2019s financing, it\u2019s supplies, it\u2019s consulting services, it\u2019s technical services, and it\u2019s financed equipment all in the annuity stream and the vast majority of that is under contract for multiple years.", "Bill Shope - JP Morgan", "Finally on the increasing authorization obviously its clear the share repurchase remains at the top of the priority lists for use of cash. Can you help us understand where this puts you on your appetite for acquisitions in 2008?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I think we still have an appetite for acquisitions, it is just that they take a longer time and we are obviously really careful as we look at them.  So we are still looking and we are still doing a lot of work; it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d have something the size of global so right away that gives you a lot of access the cash and share repurchase.", "I don\u2019t think it will change any trajectory of share repurchase; we are going to be aggressive.  If we see something on the acquisition side, we will do it and there is enough cash to do both.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research.", "Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research", "Larry, I had a question for you on the cash flow guidance. Obviously going from 1.6 to midpoint of your new range 1.9, 300 million is a nice increase.  I was just wondering, you said several times in the call that we are only one month into the year. You were just in town  six weeks ago to give us the original guidance. What\u2019s changed? What makes you more confident this early on in the year that the cash flow guidance can go up at that material level?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well, first of all, we finished \u201907 where we had spectacular results.  So if that wouldn\u2019t give me confidence I don\u2019t know what would, first of all.   I think looking at that and what we were able to do on working capital gives me more confidence. Remember when we prepare for the investor conference, you are back in September, so there is a lot of months under the belt here that we\u2019ve seen good cash performance.", "I think I also said at the investor conference it was a conservative estimate of where I thought we would be.  So, I don\u2019t really think we are raising it that much; I think our performance dictates that we do that.", "Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research", "Then on the solid ink side, Anne, you launched a new product in September, a platform bringing color pricing closer to black and white.  If you could just update us there in terms of what that experience has been like in the fourth quarter and the solid ink outlook for 2008? I think we were expecting to see some more products per your guidance earlier.  What has it been like thus far and what does the roadmap look like from here?", "Ursula Burns", "Bob the pickup we announced in the third quarter color for the price of black and white as you remember on our product set that we sent to the market and the pickup is, I will put it in three different buckets, very good across all three.", "One is the understanding and acceptance by the industry analysts and the customers is exceptional.  The pickup of the product, we launched the MFP product in the latter part of the year and we actually sold out of that multifunction product that we introduced in the marketplace; very good pickup, very good acceptance.", "We launched a printer a little bit earlier on a worldwide basis and that flow has been strong.  We will add more channels to the printer to expand our reach to the customer base.  But, the flow has been good.", "If you remember this is the start of a communication and a marketing strategy for solid ink that we will strengthen as we go forward in 2008 with new products and new offerings.", "As for new products, we have told you before that we will move solid ink up line in 2008 and we will do that for sure.  It will happen in the second half of 2008 towards the latter part of 2008 with a full line higher-end multifunction products.", "Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research", "Ursula since you are here, next week\u2019s PMA, could you just give us an update in terms of the new incremental? Not new, you\u2019ve been there for now almost a year and a half, two years and learning rapidly.  But, just in photofinishing, photo books, greeting cards market projected to go to a $1 billion within the next two or three years, all greenfield for Xerox; dialog with partners and the retail channel, how is it going and what can we expect at PMA?", "Ursula Burns", "An exciting show next week at PMA; we will be there in full force.  We will clearly discuss applications in PMA, clearly Print Engines which you already know about, color print engines both in the office and in the production space.  But, the big push at PMA will be how do we allow customers, either end user customers or retail providing customers to actually do this photo work easier.  A lot of application work will be discussed.", "Our iGen3 enhancements will be discussed and shown there and some of our office color products will be shown there as well in partnerships with our partners including FUJI Film.", "Anne Mulcahy", "We just announced a plug-in module for our work center line that brings photo finishing down from the iGen and Docucolor line into the work center line which we think is the big deal and we are partnering with FUJI Film on that.  So, you are right, it\u2019s new business and it\u2019s new opportunity for us.", "Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research", "And certainly a positive pre-announcement with [inaudible] camera I think recently coming out of Fuji?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yes.", "Matthew Troy - Citi Investment Research", "If I understand that you guys will put on a unified front, you are sharing a booth at PMA for the first time?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Absolutely.", "Ursula Burns", "We are.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "I would like to ask a couple of questions around the channel and market coverage.  First for Larry, what is your thinking now about the earnings accretion you could foresee from global in \u201808 as compared to what that estimate of global accretion might have been when you closed six months ago?", "In addition, with regard to the channel could you, Anne, comment on other resellers, other VARs outside the global channel, since you haven\u2019t really said very much about them since you began some initiatives there just about a year ago?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "On global, I think as Anne said, I mean they are performing if anything better than expectations given some of the disruption that happened at the beginning of the year.  They are accretive modestly in \u201807 and they will be accretive to more extent, which is factored in the guidance for \u201808.  So, we are confident of their performance.", "Anne Mulcahy", "in terms of other channels Jay, I would say first of all that we\u2019ve got continuing good news coming from DMO in Europe,  the vast majority of our office business now is through distribution in those geographies and we are really pleased and you can see a lot of that in the office performance.", "In the US, I would say couple of things.  One is the increase in branded color printers is a good indication that we are getting traction literally with the VARs and the resellers as it relates to the Xerox technology and we\u2019ve also done a lot of work in some of the up market opportunities with regard to some of the multi-function distribution and packaged services that is starting to take off as well.  They are clearly looking for new sources of revenue and the Xerox relationship is a good place for them to go in terms of the breadth of what we\u2019ve got to bring to the channel.  So we are pretty pleased.", "We think it continues to bring opportunity and slowly but surely we keep adding new relationships and also broadening the products and services that we bring to the channel.  But we were pleased with their fourth quarter performance and full year.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "A question about competition and some recent announcements.  Shortly after IKON pre-announced earlier this month, in fact I think the same day, Canon USA announced a re-org of the company-owned resellers.  If you had any comments on that what it might mean competitively of anything?", "Similarly with respect to corporate relationships, Oce seems to be getting closer to Fuji in terms of some product partnering and as well closer as well with Konica.  Do you see any marginal changes in either respect in terms of competition?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Let me start with the Oce relationship with Fuji, I mean it\u2019s a tactical point product.  I certainly wouldn\u2019t characterize of its strategic and we source products from lots of different places, so that\u2019s really not something that I would say is unusual.", "Oce and Konica, I mean we obviously know them as competitors very well.  Apart or even collaborating, we think we are really well positioned with the product line up and capabilities we have to compete in the marketplace.  We are confident about the distribution capabilities we have now to face off against some particularly with the addition of Global.", "From a product perspective, we are in great shape and we said it earlier, but we intend that 2008 is going to be a strong product year from a product launch perspective in 2007.  So, we don\u2019t expect to see a material difference in the competitive environment based upon that relationship.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "On the Canon side?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Canon, really no change.  I think we saw some activity from Canon 7000, but it was really more on the upgrading of their own fleet than it was quite frankly impacting us.  So, nothing that we saw that would suggest that we are losing any ground in terms of either competitive replacements or our ability to continue the pace of growth we are seeing with our production color business.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Even our office color business, Jay, 67% activity increase.", "Anne Mulcahy", "It has been great.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Phenomenal performance on our side, so we are confident.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thank you very much and thanks to all of you for participating today.

Mulcahy - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Ursula M. Burns - President, Director", "Analysts", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Operator", "Good morning and welcome to the Xerox Corporation first quarter 2008 earnings release conference call hosted by Ann Mulcahy, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Ursula Burns, President, and Larry Zimmerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the website at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call will be tape recorded. Other taping and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mrs. Mulcahy. Mrs. Mulcahy, you may begin. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you and thanks everyone for joining us today. If you\u2019ll turn to slide four, we\u2019ll provide a summary of our first quarter performance. As you know, we settled the securities lawsuit last month and took the $0.54 charge in the first quarter. Excluding this charge, we delivered earnings of $0.27 per share, up from $0.24 in the prior year. ", "Total revenue including the benefit of acquisitions was up 13% this quarter to $4.3 billion. Wholesale revenue grew by 11%, led by a steady pace of activity, color, and services, and currency gave us a four point benefit. ", "During the quarter, we increased our investments in marketing, distribution, and pricing, resulting in improved install activity across the board. It is this activity that fuels our annuity stream and long-term growth. ", "While these actions paid off in activity gains, the investments, as well as the mix of business put pressure on our earnings this quarter. The decline in gross margin was offset by a lower tax rate delivering EPS in line with our expectations, but we know we can improve overall operational performance, balancing investments in the business with costs to bring margin back in line with our model. ", "We are operating in a tougher economy and we are competing more aggressively to win share. At the same time, our commitment to earnings expansion is not wavering. We plan to continue investing in key marketing and sales initiatives while taking actions that will reduce costs. ", "As a result, we believe it is prudent to take a $0.05 restructuring charge in the second quarter that helps us accelerate cost actions. We\u2019ll walk you through how this affects Q2 and full year guidance after we review the first quarter results. ", "During the first quarter, color revenue grew 13% and now represents 40% of total revenue, an increase of 3 points from prior year. In the office and production markets, install activity ramped up, the benefit of new products, expanded distribution, and more aggressive positioning in the market place. ", "Our focus on leading with services continues to fuel our annuity with 8% growth in Q1, and I\u2019ll take a deeper dive on revenue in a moment. ", "Q1 is typically our lightest quarter on cash flow yet we are on track to deliver full-year expectations excluding the cash impact from the securities litigation settlement. As important, we are continuing to build shareholder value through $334 million in-stock buy-back during the first quarter, and Larry is going to provide you more details on our financial position in a few minutes. ", "So netting out the quarter and looking ahead to the balance of the year, we believe with the Q2 restructuring actions, focused marketing investments, and continued progress driving activity and annuity, we can deliver solid operational earnings expansion this year and we\u2019ll provide detail on what we expect for GAAP and adjusted EPS before we open it up for your questions. ", "So if you\u2019ll turn to slide five, we\u2019ll review Q1 revenue. With the addition of Global Imaging to our core business, we are competing aggressively to increase placement of Xerox systems through new products and expanded distribution. This chart shows the year-over-year compare in actual and constant currency. The adjusted column on the right assumes that Global\u2019s revenue for Q107 is included in our results for the same period. ", "Again, total revenue was up 13% in the quarter to $4.3 billion. When we adjust the compare for Global Imaging, revenue was up 5% with 4 points of positive currency. Equipment sales were up 2% in the quarter adjusting for Global Imaging and down 2% in constant currency. ", "Post-sale, which represents more than 70% of total revenue, was up 11% in the quarter. Adjusting for Global and the benefit of currency, post-sale was up 2% in Q1. ", "So I know you are wondering if and where we are seeing the impact of the economy, so this is a good place to provide a brief explanation. As we said last quarter, we operate a global business with more than half of our revenue generated from customers outside of the U.S. We serve a wide range of markets, giving us diversification globally as well as in market scope. ", "We are feeling the impact on the corporate environment in the U.S. with delayed decision making on bigger equipment deals. We\u2019ve made some pricing investments, especially in production mono to drive more activity and the strategy is working, generating more profit and more revenue. ", "As importantly, we\u2019re seeing steady improvement from our operations in Europe and in key developing markets like Russia, Eastern Europe, and India. ", "The real benefit to our business in tough economic times is our healthy annuity stream. We generated $3.2 billion in post-sales this quarter, $300 million more than Q1 of last year. We did see more conservative purchasing of supplies by our North American distributors, reflecting their cautious approach to managing inventory in this economy. But we remain very confident in the continued strength of our annuity. ", "And more of the business from our customers is moving to rental or operating leases rather than capital acquisitions, especially in our production business. With operating leases, we don\u2019t see the revenue in equipment sales that flows through to post-sale over time. ", "Building off a strong 2007, Xerox global services generated $859 million in annuity revenue, up 8%. By targeting more vertical markets like healthcare, legal, and education, we are bringing our technology and expertise to areas that can decrease costs by simplifying their document intensive work. It is really an attractive proposition in any economy. ", "So summing it up, it\u2019s a challenging market in U.S. corporate environments. Fortunately we are global and diverse. Our annuity stream drives profitable revenue growth and we are stepping up marketing investments to win the installs and service deals that fuel our long-term success, and color is part of this success. So if you\u2019ll turn to slide six, we\u2019ll take a look at color. ", "Last year more than 40 billion pages were printed on Xerox color systems, significantly more than any competitor. Most important, pages remain the best source of our double-digit color annuity growth. Color page volume was up again this quarter, growing 32% and color now represents 14% of total pages, 3 points more than Q1 of last year. ", "Revenue from color this quarter was up 13%, which includes a 6 point currency benefit. Color equipment revenue was down 1% in constant currency, largely due to the mix of products sold and the pricing investments that are driving activity. The leverage here is in the annuity with post-sale from color up 16% in the quarter, and that\u2019s without factoring in any benefit from Global Imaging. ", "Color now accounts for 40% of our total revenue but only 14% of our total pages, indicating a tremendous growth opportunity for Xerox going forward. ", "So if you\u2019ll turn to slide seven for a review of the production business, but before we get started let me explain one change in the reporting on the production and office segments. Results from our developing markets operations are now included in the revenue providing a global perspective on our performance in these areas. We\u2019ll still show you total DMO results so you too can track progress in this growth area but know that numbers here include development market refills as well. ", "Total production revenue grew 6%, including a five-point benefit from currency. Equipment sale revenue was down 1%. Again, the focus here is on post-sale and where we see the benefit of tremendous page volume. ", "Xerox production systems generate more than half of the total digital color pages in the entire industry and that is fueling the 9% growth in our production annuity and is the leading indicator for stronger production revenue growth going forward. ", "We saw solid install growth in Q1, reflecting demand for new products and the benefit of pricing investments in the production mono business that drove strong activity. While color is certainly a key growth area in this business, black and white remains a big profitable business for us. With continuous feed, high volume cut sheet, and light production systems, we fully intend to remain the industry leader here. ", "In color, we had continued strong demand for the DocuColor 7000, 8000, and 260 series. Increasingly, developing markets are ramping up in digital production printing and this quarter was no exception, with DMO production revenue up 28%. ", "Next month is drupa, the industry\u2019s largest trade show and held every four years. We will be the strongest force at the show in digital printing, highlighting the competitive advantage of our technology, work flow, services, and applications, and we\u2019ll also make news with new technology and industry breakthroughs that will further strengthen our leadership, and there is more to come on that. ", "So if you\u2019ll turn to slide eight, we\u2019ll review the office segment. ", "With the benefit of Global Imaging in our results, total office revenue was up 16% in the quarter and 12% in constant currency. Our competitive play to install more and more Xerox units helps to boost post-sale, which was up 13% in the quarter and equipment sales were up 25%. ", "Our continued success in this market is led by expanding distribution, bringing the quality of our brands and extensive portfolio to more businesses of any size, and we are doing that through Global Imaging, which continues to expand their business, acquiring five more companies in the short time they\u2019ve been a part of us, and we are doing it through stronger partnerships with our resellers, agents, and dealers. ", "Building on the strategy to grow channels regionally, we\u2019ve just announced our pending purchase of Veenman, the largest office technology distributor in The Netherlands. This acquisition gives us access to more than 4,000 new small and medium-sized customers and more than doubles our sales force in this region, and we are going to continue on this path. ", "Great technology and services, more ways to sell the Xerox brand, and a strengthened competitive position that gives us more marketplace momentum, and we are seeing that progress through increased install activity -- 35% increase in black and white MFDs and 40% increase in color multi-function. And installs of color printers were up 35%. ", "Developing markets continues to contribute to growth in the office segment, with equipment sale growth of 21% and total revenue up 12%. ", "And in the second quarter, we\u2019ll add to what is already the industry\u2019s broadest portfolio of offerings, so expect to see news about several product launches aimed at businesses small or large, priced right with features that make it easier to get work done. ", "So if you\u2019ll turn to slide nine, we\u2019ll take a closer look at our developing markets performance. While the results from our developing markets are reflected in the office and production segments, here\u2019s a look at overall performance. Revenue from DMO was up 17% with post-sale up 16% and equipment sale revenue up 21%. Growth is driven from our strong presence in Eurasia, in India, Central and Eastern Europe and Latin America. And while our install activity is weighted towards product for small and mid-sized businesses, we are seeing increased growth for our production devices and higher-end multi-function systems. In all, it was a very good quarter for DMO across the board. ", "So just a quick summary before I hand it over to Larry, our revenue story is consistent -- annuity, activity, acquisitions, color, and services were all key drivers of growth. Our earnings were impacted by the combination of marketing investments, channel mix, and some negative currency that resulted in lower margins. ", "While we are taking actions in Q2 to get the model back on track, our investments and expanded distribution drove stronger activity, fueling the annuity stream that supports our long-term profitable growth. ", "And that\u2019s a good place for me to hand it over to Larry. I\u2019ll be back to wrap up and discuss our second quarter expectations and then Larry, Ursula and I will take your questions. Larry. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne and good morning.  While we delivered $0.27 of adjusted EPS and met the middle of our guidance range, we had some external and internal elements that impacted the way we achieved it. I will go into more detail on the next few slides but my key messages are: consistent revenue trend but skewed to lower margin channels; lower total gross profit margin down 1.3 points, driven by a sales margin decline of 2 points; the decline is due to product and channel mix, price investments, as well as rapid weakening of the dollar to the YEN; growth in selling expense as we invest in coverage and distribution; a tax settlement that will yield cash this year that offset the gross margin decline; adjusted earnings of $0.27; GAAP earnings per share were lower by $0.54 as we took a $491 million after-tax litigation charge. ", "Now let\u2019s be more specific -- slide 11. Anne covered revenues so I won\u2019t repeat it but I want to reiterate that in this economic environment, we were quite pleased with the revenue results this quarter. ", "Channel mix, product mix, pricing as well as a 12% weakening of the dollar versus the YEN in the quarter gave us 39.3 gross margin, 1.3 points down year over year and below our model of 40% to 41%. Given the dynamics of the market, we\u2019ve decided to accelerate cost actions and think it is prudent to assume we will be in the low end of the 40% to 41% range. ", "We have successfully done this before and know how to adjust our business model so that it continues to deliver expanded earnings. The focus of our actions is on technical service and supply chain cost, G&A and other infrastructure. We expect this to be in the $60 million range and although as we always do, we\u2019ll make every effort to offset it, we believe that we need to adjust our full-year guidance to contemplate this approximately $0.05 of restructuring action. ", "RD&E continues with consistent investment. SAG increases are primarily related to coverage and marketing investments of $21 million around the world. We believe our R&D investments and distribution investments will drive future growth. In SAG, $38 million is due to currency and $90 million is due to Global. ", "Other net was up $23 million year over year and is driven by currency losses, primarily due to the rapid change in the YEN to the dollar relationship in the quarter. We do a certain amount of hedging but when you have this significant kind of change in 90 days, it\u2019s hard to offset. ", "Equity income was up due to last year\u2019s restructuring at Fuji Xerox. Our adjusted tax rate was 21%, excluding our litigation charge and was improved due to the settlement of a tax audit that will yield cash this year. ", "So adjusted earnings without the litigation charge were $0.27. GAAP earnings with the $491 million litigation charge were a loss of $0.27. ", "Slide 12 -- cash flow from core operations was $5 million and cash from ops was $52 million. This is consistent with what we achieved in first quarter \u201907 with the exception of $100 million swing in accounts payable, which is just a timing issue as to when cash leaves to pay bills. ", "First, fourth quarter had a particularly strong source of cash from accounts payable. Inventory grew as it does each first quarter to build up for the year, so I think the results are on a path for good cash flow performance for the year. Our guidance was $1.8 billion to $2 billion before the litigation charge and now we will be in the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, just adjusting for the $795 million before tax litigation reserve. ", "CapEx was $71 million for the quarter, on target and debt increased slightly. ", "Our share repurchase for the quarter was $334 million, as we said we would accelerate share repurchase after last year\u2019s acquisition of Global Imaging. As of today, we have purchased $354 million, or 23 million shares this year for a total of $2.5 billion and 161 million shares since the inception of the program. We have approximately $1 billion remaining under our January 2008 board authorization. ", "Slide 13 -- our business model is driven by annuity. As Anne mentioned, even in times of economic uncertainty, this provides us a stable revenue stream and good source of cash flow. The leading indicators for our annuity continue to be positive. As we go through this scorecard, keep in mind that machines in the field as well as page data did not include printers, developing market countries, and Global Imaging systems, and all revenue measures exclude Global. Including these items would only improve the results. ", "Looking first at the top left box, digital revenue in the quarter was up 8%, MIF was up 7%, and digital pages flat. Color continues to drive digital growth with 16% revenue, 39% MIF, and 32% page growth. This growth, along with the positive impact of color on price per page continues to provide us a great opportunity as color represents only 20% of the MIF and 14% of the pages. Color also increases price per page. ", "Black and white digital pages and MIF is stable with declines in pages being driven in part by the transition of pages onto color and color capable devices. Black and white MIF does continue to grow, which along with our strong color growth is a positive indicator for future annuity. ", "We also continue to see strong growth in services, which is another key post-sale indicator and an important element of our growth strategy. Services annuity is up 8% in the first quarter and we see this growth continuing as more and more customers look to Xerox to help them reduce their cost by optimizing and simplifying their document process infrastructure. ", "These leading indicators, as well as the strong install performance that Anne reviewed with you, reflect well on the continued annuity performance. ", "So in summary, we delivered consistent revenue performance. We understand and have actions in place to improve our gross profit margin, are confident in our investments in coverage and distribution, and cash is on track and allows us to move forward on our share repurchase program and continue to deliver shareholder value. ", "Now I\u2019ll give it back to Anne. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you, Larry. So if you\u2019ll turn to slide 15, we\u2019ll view our earnings expectations going forward. So you are going to see here the adjustment for the litigation charge in both our Q1 results and full year guidance. In the second quarter, we expect earnings in the range of $0.23 to $0.25, and that includes $0.05 of restructuring. And as Larry mentioned, we will work hard to offset this $0.05 impact during the balance of the year. So for the full year, we\u2019re confident we\u2019ll deliver another year of earnings expansion with adjusted EPS in the range of $1.26 to $1.30. ", "So if you\u2019ll turn to slide 16 for a summary and then we\u2019ll open it up to your questions. Our results this quarter are a good indication that our growth strategy is working, yielding profitable revenue through growth in activity, annuity, color, and services. And we are not letting up at all in any of these areas -- in fact, our marketing initiatives are strengthening our competitive position in all areas. ", "The compounding effect of marketing investment, business mix, and the impact of the YEN could not be offset by our traditional cost productivity. We understand the issue, we know how to fix it, and we are already executing on the required actions. ", "At the same time, we remain focused on building shareholder value through share repurchase, dividends, and acquisitions. ", "We remain quite confident in our ability to deliver on our commitments, build value, and win in the marketplace. ", "So thank you for your attention and now Larry, Ursula, and I will take your questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. Anne, Larry, Ursula -- could you comment on the two side of the cost and expense coin? On the one hand, could you be more specific about the restructuring that you are going to be taking, particularly in terms of supply chain? This is not really a new issue. You seem to have had an ongoing focus anyway for some time on procurement, cost of manufacturing, ESR gross margin, so what\u2019s incremental here in terms of what you are going to be doing?", "And on the other hand, could you be a little bit more specific in terms of the nature of the investments you\u2019ve been making in coverage and marketing and would you expect that to be ongoing incremental spending as we saw in Q1?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay, Jay, thanks. I\u2019ll start and certainly turn it over to Ursula as it relates to the supply chain restructuring, but let me start with the expense side and as we said on the call, the vast majority of SAG growth was really due to Global and currency. It was about $128 million of the growth. ", "The remaining $42 million, half of that was with regard to compensation increases year over year. The other half was all incremental coverage and marketing and it came in the form of incremental territories as it relates to things like continuous feed and packaging and photo opportunities, as well as just pure coverage investments and more feet on the street. Marketing, particularly as it relates to low-end demand, which is yielding already in the short-term, so quite intentional as it relates to those marketing investments. ", "We do view those investments as continuing, although we believe that the growth will moderate in absolute spend and the ratios will get better for the balance of the year as it relates to SAG. So I think that kind of gives you a sense of where we are headed. ", "On the cost side, there\u2019s no question that a combination of elements -- currency, pricing, channel mix -- the fact that we had very strong growth in developing markets and services, which have lower margins with relative weakness in the U.S. all played out there, and that\u2019s why we decided we think it\u2019s really smart to do the restructuring now. These are things that we have been doing and continue to plan doing over the next four to six quarters, but we know what to do so we can accelerate it and clearly drive improvement quicker to offset some of the other pressures that we are seeing. ", "So the vast majority of the restructuring is aimed at cost and it is going to be driven by technical service and supply chain and for specifics on that, Ursula, you may want to comment. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "Jay, you are correct we have been speaking about making sure that we keep ahead of ourselves on supply chain excellence, particularly in the area of costs, as we broaden our channels. We have to look at that just to keep effective and efficient. ", "What Anne said, we decided to actually accelerate some of the actions. The two areas that we are going to focus on which will have an ancillary third area effect are warehousing for sure, some manufacturing, and as we restructure and look at our warehousing and manufacturing differently, it will drive some improvement in transportation costs as well. ", "So broad infrastructural areas but focus on warehousing, manufacturing, and some transportation. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "The next question has to do with pricing. You seem to have been at the wrong end of the pricing investment range we\u2019ve talked about for some time. Could you foresee that it might go even beyond the minus 5% to 10% that we have typically seen in any rural areas?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Jay, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say it\u2019s the wrong end -- it was the high end in the sense that we say it\u2019s a 5% to 10% range and our pricing investments clearly were in the 10% range. Selectively we really focused on two areas. One was the mono production area, and you\u2019ll see from the activity that it worked and it will continue to drive mono production activity, which is a great profit driver for us in terms of pages. ", "And the other is to continue the acceleration of color adoption, so really being aggressive and making sure that it\u2019s attractive to acquire color-enabled technology in this and you saw the activity levels in color, which were 40% in multi-function, 35% in color printing, a little bit more modest 5% or 6% range in production color but still good activity growth where there is so -- at the high end where the pages are. ", "So I think we certainly intentionally did that and we -- this is more about us than it is about the competition and clearly we think we can manage it going forward so that we don\u2019t see additional spikes in pricing. I think our intent is to actually deal with the cost side of the equation so that we can continue to be aggressive in pricing and get the benefits of the activity but not see the hit in margin that we did this quarter. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Finally you mentioned your view of U.S. corporate business conditions. How would you describe your other key markets like public sector, graphic arts, transactional, financial, and so forth?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think public sector is fine. We\u2019re seeing good continued activity in public sector. SMB, fine. Actually in financial services, we\u2019re doing very well because we are providing a lot of document services to optimize infrastructure that are helping rationalize cost in the financial services industry. ", "So we singled out the general corporate enterprise environment just because there is a level of caution and anxiety in terms of decision making that clearly is delaying. It\u2019s primarily on big equipment deals though, because we were really pleased our services signings were double-digit growth in the quarter, so we felt good about that. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "And graphic arts, Jay, remains strong for us as well and that\u2019s where we are seeing the growth in our high-end cut sheet and production color -- ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Sabbagha with Lehman Brothers.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. Just a couple of quick questions, sticking with the economy question, have you seen any of the weakness, the economic weakness in the U.S. move overseas, Europe or anything -- well, you\u2019re not big in Asia but anything you are seeing through Fuji Xerox in Asia?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think the answer would be no. Our Europe results, we kind of highlighted as being strong and clearly developing markets, as you saw, was extraordinarily strong from a growth and a profitability perspective. We have not seen any downturn either in Europe or anyplace else. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay, and then on color, color equipment sales, not installs, but looked relatively weak in the production business. Can you just provide a few more details on what went on there? Was it a trading down, was it pricing in color production or are you seeing a little bit of a slowdown because of the economy there?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I would say it\u2019s not economy because activity was quite strong and even though certainly pricing certainly is a factor, I would say that in color, it\u2019s a continuing trend for us. There wasn\u2019t any really major shifts in color pricing investments. Where we really shifted was on the mono production side. And if you look at color ESR, operating leases and rentals are really becoming a much bigger factor, particularly in the production environment. In the world of iGen and DocuColor, we\u2019re seeing a lot more operating lease activity and if you actually looked at the year-over-year impact, it cost us two points of the equipment sales. So that would actually keep us, quite frankly, very much on trend on the equipment sales side with good activity that actually was as strong or stronger in most areas of the color portfolio. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "And with more competition coming into that market as the year progresses, what is your view around the competitive threats in color production?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Ursula. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think that we have seen very little near-term impact, hardly any. I think that the products that came to market already, the Canon 7000, we are very comfortable with our performance of our 7000 AP device that we launched last year and our 8000 AP device. Those two devices performed very well in the marketplace and faced off against the Canon 7000 very effectively. ", "HP is talking about coming with a color device and if you look at our entire portfolio, [EPC] color and production color are comfortable as well there. I think the only other competitor that talked in this space is probably Ricoh and we see absolutely no impact on our activity from Ricoh. ", "So I think that while the competitors are speaking about being there, we are there today and performing very well in EPC and production color. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "And I would add we\u2019ll have a lot more out there in the future too, so we\u2019re not standing still by any means. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "And is the pricing on the derivatives of the 7000, the 16 to 65 page per minute, what do you think about the pricing structures of those two products, I guess?", "Ursula M. Burns", "As Anne spoke about our equipment pricing are in line with pricing declines, are in line with what we expect in the marketplace. No special activity. I think the breadth of our portfolio allows us to hold pretty well to tight pricing activity in our segment, of 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 110, we can actually hold prices in those product lines because we have such a broad product line. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Banc of America.", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America", "I guess the first one is it sounds like the restructuring charge that you are taking this quarter is one-time in nature. It sounds non-recurring in nature, so I guess I\u2019m just interested in getting your view on why it\u2019s being included in the \u201908 outlook. ", "And then I guess the next question would be you know, didn\u2019t see the iGen pointed to in the production segment comments. I was just wondering what\u2019s going on with the iGen. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, let me just begin by saying we didn\u2019t highlight iGen because quite frankly the 7000, 8000 activity was the highlight, if you will, in terms of growth. But iGen absolute installs we\u2019re quite pleased with and the trends have been very positive. We did have a very, very strong performance a year ago in iGen that muted the performance a little bit but in absolute numbers, it\u2019s on trend and we re pleased. So you shouldn\u2019t read anything negative into the iGen performance, and pages continue to look great in iGen, driving very, very strong post-sale growth from the iGen product line. ", "On the restructuring charge, I think we\u2019ve looked at it as we clearly -- these are cost actions that we had anticipated taking over the next four to six quarters. We are accelerating them. We think it\u2019s the right thing to do in light of all that we know right now, and I think as a team we feel very committed that we really have an accountability to offset those and are -- although we are not prepared today to tell you how, that\u2019s going to be a big focus of ours going forward, so that we can remain -- really keep the integrity of our outlook as we deliver expectations to the market. ", "I know that different companies do it different ways, but we actually think this is the right way to do it. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America", "Okay, I appreciate the commentary. And just I guess more of a clarification around pricing; it sounds like you are not seeing anything in the general marketplace or correct me -- I guess if you can just answer this question, I suppose -- what are you seeing in terms of pricing in the general marketplace sort of away from the specific actions that you guys have been taking to accelerate product placement?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything that we would look at that we would say is really outside of the trends we\u2019ve been seeing. If anything, I think there is a level of cautiousness about profitable revenue growth in the industry, so we are not seeing anything that really is out of the ordinary. ", "As I said, we did decide that accelerating the mono production business was a very wise thing to do in terms of the size of that market and the rest of our portfolio, and it\u2019s working. Obviously we didn\u2019t anticipate some of the currency impacts from a YEN perspective that we had to absorb during the quarter, but I think that overall there is nothing. ", "Ursula, have -- from your perspective?", "Ursula M. Burns", "No, I think that you said it all. In the high-end cut sheet area, we took actions to drive placements but in color, across the board office and production, we see nothing out of the ordinary. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "And Global, which has a great pulse, if you will, on the marketplace in terms of the SMB market, really hasn\u2019t seen anything from a pricing perspective that\u2019s impacted their margins. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America", "Thank you and then just one last one, going back, circling back to the demand comments, if I could. It does seem from a broader IT, hardware perspective, demand has certainly softened in the U.S. some and it sounds like based on our checks, this is broader IT hardware, that Europe is kind of following a couple of months behind. So do you get any sense that -- it sounds like you are not seeing an impact to your European demand yet, but do you get any sense that something could be coming up over the next couple of months based on conversations you are having with customers? I guess that\u2019s the first part. ", "The second part, it sounds like you are saying Global is holding up kind of relatively well, maybe in line, putting up the kind of growth that they\u2019ve been putting up in SMB in the U.S., which is pretty impressive given that SMB in the U.S. has been slowing markedly for general IT products. Do you get a sense that Global will be able to continue putting up those kinds of growth numbers as we move through the middle of the year here?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Europe first -- I think one of the things about Europe is that we actually have, if you looked at the portfolio in Europe, there are more -- there\u2019s more of a services content in terms of contracts in Europe than there is anywhere else in the world. So very big services deals, very big portfolio of pipeline for services opportunities, and I do think that the services business is more resilient than the hardware business and so we actually get a relatively stable and even bullish outlook from Europe in terms of the impact that our services offerings are having in Europe. ", "So I think that really is a help and so we are not as concerned about a downturn in Europe in general. ", "And on Global, from a trends perspective, we are really pleased. I think it is important to note that first quarter of last year was their last fiscal quarter. They were on a different cycle than we were. It was their strongest quarter, so the compare clearly put pressure on their equipment sale performance. Their post-sale was great and we are not at all concerned about the trends that Global is on. We think they\u2019ve got just an extraordinary discipline in delivering results, although the compare was a really tough one based upon the physical cycle, everything else looks great. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America", "Thanks a lot, very helpful. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks very much. You mentioned some of your channel partners are reducing inventories. Can you give us some color where channel inventory levels are and the magnitude of the impact in the quarter?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I can give you some general numbers here but I would look at it and say just year over year, the impact to us was about -- I\u2019d say about an $8 million profit impact, which you would translate into something like a $15 million to $20 million revenue impact in the -- for inventory levels in the channel, which is substantial but not unusual. We\u2019ve been in these areas before and I do believe that it\u2019s cyclical and they do come back and clearly this is one that we think will come back as it relates to channel inventory. ", "So the difficult part of it is just that because of the flow through of profit from consumables, it really does have a big hit in terms of the profit perspective, but there is no question it will come back. If you look at the equipment sales, I mean, look at the 35% growth in color printers. There is nowhere to go but up in terms of catching up on the supplies perspective, so we do think it was kind of a tactical move in the quarter that has to repair itself over time. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "And do you have a sense as to where those channel inventories are now? Are they going to continue to worsen lower do you think over the next couple of quarters or is that behind us at this point?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I don\u2019t think -- I mean, I don\u2019t think I want to share the specifics on channel inventory levels but I think that the strength of equipment sales would suggest to you that it would be difficult to actually manage the inventories any lower. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Okay, and second question relates to just printing volumes overall in conjunction with the economy. Are you seeing your customers -- any pressure there on volumes? And related, are corporates printing in color less on some of the color capable devices? Are you seeing any usage pattern changes in color printing? Thanks. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think the answer is no. I mean, color pages were up 32% in the quarter. The average for all of last year was 31%, so we think color pages would indicate we\u2019ve got a really consistent level of color printing. I do think it\u2019s fair to say that there is more printing on color enabled devices, so that some of those may be kind of more black and white in nature, just based upon what color enabled does. But the overall pages coming from color devices is staying quite robust, which we are quite pleased with. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "One final question for Larry; Larry, bad debt was up slightly in the quarter and you sold about $200 million in receivables. Can you talk just generally about your customers credit quality -- you know, DSOs, et cetera, and payment and the general health of that book? Thanks. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well, generally speaking we were quite pleased with the aging and payment and the way AR is going. I mean, I think there are always areas in AR where you can improve DSOs but we\u2019ve had really good improvement in DSOs over the last couple of years. We don\u2019t see any real pattern, a negative pattern at all on receivables and I think you get these onesies and twosies of ups or downs adjusting the reserve, but we are comfortable with where it is right now -- don\u2019t see any real change. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay, I think there\u2019s time for another question. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Good morning. Just a couple of final questions; Anne, maybe you could talk with regard to what\u2019s been going on with your equipment sales. Obviously you\u2019ve had substantial growth in terms of shipments, very strong placements this quarter, sort of I think accelerating but continuing the trend you\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. How should we think about what\u2019s going on within your MIF, when we are going to start seeing it more reflected in post-sale? Just your thoughts on sort of how this trends and how we should be thinking about the year as we go forward, so that we do start to see again a reacceleration on the post-sale line. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, I think as we look at it, and that chart that Larry shows, which is really the indicators for annuity, gives us a lot of confidence with regard to post-sale. I mean, you can have an anomaly in a quarter just because 90 days, you can have some shifts in terms of, you know, whether it\u2019s billing or supplies or that kind of thing. But those indicators really are the key to post-sale acceleration and the real keys are color and with 32% page growth, and we are seeing digital MIF growing, we\u2019re seeing color MIF growing very nicely. So services growing at 8% -- I mean, all of those clearly are the way we look at what the future is going to bring in post-sale and I think we do believe that over the course of the year as we look back, you will see very good progress in post-sale, and it\u2019s why we keep focusing so much on activity and making sure that we report activity growth because it truly is the best indicator for drivers of annuity. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, and I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but did you give what your total MIF has done?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I didn\u2019t. I can. Total MIF has grown 3%. That includes everything, Shannon, so it\u2019s light lens included, all -- digital MIF rose 7% and our color MIF grew 39%, so if you look at the trends, as we looked at full-year 2007, MIF was growing at 2%. In the first quarter of \u201908, it\u2019s 3%. Digital MIF is stable and color growth went from 35% full year \u201907 to 39% in the first quarter, so there is nothing that doesn\u2019t look good in terms of install activity and MIF trend. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, great. And then if you could just talk a little bit, I mean, there\u2019s obviously been a lot of things going on on the distribution side with Danka and Konica, and you know with what Ricoh is doing and with IBM, if you could just talk a bit about what you are seeing from the competition, how you are viewing -- obviously Ursula talked a bit about on the color side with the Canon product, but just in general how you sort of see the copier world shape going I guess through 2008. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "A good indication is Ursula and I were actually down with Global last weekend and you know, we talked a lot about what\u2019s happening in the marketplace and kind of the channel perspective. I mean, I think we see consolidation out of weakness versus out of strength, and that positions us well to gain share in that environment. So we are actually looking at it and targeting it, whether it\u2019s the Ricoh acquisition of the IBM continuous feed or the Konica Minolta acquisition of Danka, all of that we believe creates an opportunity for us to gain share in this market, which is one of the reasons why we thought it is time to be somewhat aggressive on the marketing and coverage side because we think we are best-positioned right now to gain share. ", "And obviously we are taking a similar strategy in Europe with the acquisition of Veenman, which is a Global-like, well-run company, great returns that sold no Xerox technology that will now be integrating Xerox technology into great customer relationships. ", "So I think we are real clear on this one. We know where we are going and we think we are advantaged from a distribution perspective and it just keeps getting better. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, great. Thank you. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay. Thank you very much for your participation and your interest. Have a great day.

She is joined by Ursula Burns, President, and Larry Zimmerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being tape recorded. Other taping and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mrs. Mulcahy. Mrs. Mulcahy, you may begin. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you, Lauren and thanks to all of you for joining us today. We are going to begin at slide four and you will see a summary of our second quarter performance. The strength of our global annuity model resulted in second quarter earnings and cash in line with our expectations. We reported earnings of $0.24 per share, which does include $0.05 per share from a previously announced restructuring charge. ", "We are seeing the challenges in the U.S. economy affect us primarily in large enterprises where there is a hesitancy to purchase higher end technology. However, this pressure was largely offset by steady growth in developing markets, consistent performance in the small and mid-sized business segment, and an increasing demand from customers looking to drive down costs by using our document management services. ", "While these areas contributed to revenue growth and support our healthy annuity stream, they did have an impact on gross margin. We\u2019re managing the pressure on margin with a clear focus on cost reductions and operational improvements to ensure we deliver solid bottom line results. ", "Total revenue of $4.5 billion is up 8%, largely driven by 10% post sale growth. Currency gave us a four-point benefit. Our gross margin was 39.2% of revenue, down a little more than a point. Selling, administrative, and general expenses were 25.8% of revenue, about flat from this time last year. We are staying the course with our marketing and sales coverage investments this year. ", "While the tougher economy has forced a hard look at all business decisions, we believe that expanding coverage, making pricing investments, and acting on more marketing initiatives serves us well today as well as in the long-term. We are already seeing these actions benefit us in developing markets, through Global Imaging, and from the install activity for our office color systems. And at the same time, we\u2019re managing the balance sheet well, generating $442 million in cash from operations during the second quarter. ", "We repurchased $377 million in Xerox shares this quarter, investing $711 million in stock buy-back during the first half of the year alone, and our board of directors approved an additional $1 billion for share repurchase, bringing the total available authorization to $1.7 billion. ", "So if you turn to slide five, we\u2019ll overview our Q2 revenue. So here\u2019s a look at the revenue trends, noting the year-over-year compare in actual and constant currencies. The adjusted column on this chart assumes that Global\u2019s total revenue for Q207 is included in our results for the same period. You will recall that we closed on the Global Imaging acquisition in mid-May of 2007, which gave us a month-and-a-half of benefit in the second quarter last year. So going forward, we will no longer need to adjust for the Global Imaging benefit, since we\u2019ve now lapsed the acquisition date. ", "Again, total revenue was up 8% in the quarter to $4.5 billion. When we adjust the compare for Global Imaging, revenue was up 5% with four points of positive currency. The leverage from post sale continues to be significant. It was up 10% in the quarter. That\u2019s an increase of $306 million with Global Imaging. Adjusting for Global and the benefit from currency, the trend in post sale remains strong, up 4% in Q2. ", "Where we are seeing the most impact from the economy is in production equipment sales, which led to equipment revenue up 2% in the quarter but down 5% without the benefit of Global Imaging and currency. As I mentioned earlier, our document management services are an area of strength for us. In fact, during the second quarter, we signed our largest outsourcing win to date in the U.S., a $100 million plus agreement with a major telecom company to manage the print operations of its 9,000 site serving more than 300,000 employees, and this deal is consistent with what we are seeing from our large enterprise customers -- services led deals that help them reduce costs and get more from their technology for less. It is a great value proposition for our customers and a marketplace differentiator for Xerox and it is working. ", "Our services offerings have generated $1.8 billion in annuity revenue in the first half of this year. That\u2019s up 8% from the first half of 2007, and color continues to be a strong growth driver as well, so turn to slide six and we\u2019ll take a closer look at color. ", "The adoption of color printing is accelerating. So far this year, more than $25 billion color pages have been printed on our system, putting us on pace for $50 billion color pages in 2008, and that\u2019s a 25% increase over last year. Revenue from color grew 11% this quarter to $1.7 billion, including a six point currency benefit. Post sale revenue from color grew 17%, and that\u2019s without factoring in any benefit from Global Imaging. And color now represents half of our total equipment sales and 40% of total revenue. ", "There are two key factors resulting in the flat equipment sales for color this quarter. First, the economic pressure in the U.S. and second, the timing of major new production launches delayed purchases this quarter. We will see the benefit of those launches in the second half, especially coming through our European and developing markets operations. ", "So if you turn to slide seven, we\u2019ll give you more details on our production business. Total production revenue grew 4% including a five point benefit from currency. Most important, color page growth lifted our post sale revenue up 9% in the quarter. So keep in mind that no one else in the industry comes close to generating the production pages we do. According to the research firm InfoTrends, our DocuColor and iGen presses account for about half of the total worldwide color pages printed by high-speed digital systems. They tell us that\u2019s more than twice as much as our nearest competitor. ", "In May, at the industry trade show known as Drupa, we launched six production color systems, including the iGen 4, the most productive and highest quality cut-sheet digital press in the industry. We also announced the Xerox 700 entry production color system and the DocuColor 5000 AP for mid-market production color printing. Along with our new color continuous feed system, we significantly upgraded our portfolio and sent a strong reminder to the industry of our leadership in this marketplace. ", "Drupa was a huge success for us and it exceeded our expectations at every turn. Order taking was 30% more than our goal heading into the show and we sold more than 300 systems and software applications, including a multiple iGen 4 and iGen 3 order to a photo and print lab in Switzerland, and four color continuous feed systems to [Strafor], a large European printer. ", "We took advantage of the order-taking opportunity at Drupa to unveil these new systems, but installs primarily don\u2019t start until late Q3. The result of the timing is a decline in production equipment revenue in Q2, with momentum building in the second half of the year. We are seeing strong demand for the iGen 4, with many large customers holding back on iGen 3 orders in anticipate of the iGen 4, and the Xerox 700 meets the need for high quality production printing at a very attractive price point, so much so that we are already seeing demand outpace supply. That\u2019s a good problem to have and one that we are addressing with urgency heading into the second half of the year. ", "So if you turn to slide eight, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the performance in our office marketplace. With the benefit of Global Imaging in our results, total office revenue was up 9% in the quarter and 5% in constant currency. Our competitive play to install more and more Xerox units helped to boost post sale, which was up 10% in the quarter. Equipment sales were up 5%, and we continue to expand distribution, bringing the quality of our brand and extensive portfolio to more businesses of any size. ", "Global Imaging acquired Florida\u2019s Saxon Business Systems in Q2 and last week purchased a company that extends its coverage in Nevada. That\u2019s seven acquisitions Global has made since we bought the company last May. It is a strategy worth repeating and that\u2019s why we purchased Veenman, the largest office technology dealer in The Netherlands, and we are looking for other opportunities to extend our coverage to regional distributors. Veenman gives us access to more than 4,000 new SMB customers and more than doubles our sales force in this region. More distribution translates into increased install activity, up 34% in color MFDs and 10% in black-and-white multi-function, and installs of color printers were up 12%. ", "During the quarter, we continued to aggressively expand our product portfolio for the SMB marketplace with competitively priced printers and multi-function systems, and there\u2019s more to come in the second half of this year, priced right and available through our multiple channels of distribution. And that\u2019s clearly what\u2019s driving DMO results in the office, with equipment sales growth of 16% and total office revenue up 14%. Turn to slide nine for a closer look at our performance in developing markets. ", "While the results from our developing markets are reflected in the office and production segment, here is a look at the overall regional performance. Revenue from DMO was up 19%, with post sale up 19% and equipment sale revenue up 18%. Any way you look at it, it was a strong quarter for developing markets across the board. ", "About a third of the overall revenue growth generated this quarter came from our developing markets, progress that we expect will continue throughout the year as demand picks up for our technology, both office and production systems and for document services. ", "So on that note, I would like to hand it over to Larry, and then of course I\u2019ll be back to wrap up and discuss Q3 expectations, and then Larry, Ursula, and I will take your questions. Larry, over to you. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Thank you, Anne and good morning. In the second quarter, we delivered to our expectations, with earnings per share of $0.24 and $430 million of core cash flow. I would categorize the quarter as good overall results with strong performance in some areas -- post sale growth, DMO, and office, balanced by weaker results in production and pressure on gross profit margin due to the mix of channels, products, and price. ", "The economy, as well as the timing of new product introductions played a part in a slower production business. DMO and Global Imaging played a very positive role in office. In addition, our cash flow performance and optimism going forward gave us the confidence to continue to invest in distribution acquisitions and buy back 27 million shares. ", "So let\u2019s go to slide 11 and review the P&L. Anne reviewed the revenue with you but it\u2019s important to note again the 4% growth of post sale revenue in constant currency and apples-to-apples in Global Imaging drivers our earnings and cash flow in a tough environment. Gross profit margin declined about 1%, driven by product and channel mix, as well as the year-over-year price effect of first quarter price actions. ", "The channel mix affect is reflective of the slower performance in the U.S. large accounts versus considerable growth in DMO and services, but through time this should self-correct. ", "From a second quarter view, we actually saw some improvement in price and margin sequentially. With restructuring actions, we would expect to see continued improvement by fourth quarter. ", "Having said that, our gross margin business model is 40 to 41, and with the first half at 39.3, we expect to be in the 39 to 40 range for the full year. As we have said before, we believe our model is flexible and we plan on adjusting it so that we will deliver earnings consistent with the full year guidance that we had given in the first quarter of $1.26 to $1.30, including the second quarter $0.05 restructuring charge, and any additional we feel we need to do later. ", "In expense management, we delivered productivity in R&D with improved expense to revenue, which we\u2019ll continue, and flat expense to revenue and SAG as we invest in distribution. The major part of the year-over-year SAG dollar growth is currency and Global Imaging. ", "As we guided last quarter, we took a $63 million, $0.05 a share restructuring charge, primarily gross profit related, and that will help margin going forward. Net income was lower, including the $63 million restructuring charge. ", "The tax rate was 24%, flat year over year but the rate was 26% if restructuring is pulled out. Restructuring was tax affected approximately 32%. Going forward for the remainder of the year, we would expect the tax rate to be 26%. And finally, EPS was $0.24, in the middle of our guidance, $0.23 to $0.25, inclusive of the $0.05 restructuring charge. Next slide. ", "We are pleased with second quarter results of $430 million of core cash and $442 million of total cash from operations. This keeps us on track to maintain our full year commitment of $1.1 billion core cash flow, allowing for the $795 million for litigation settlement we talked about last quarter. We expect settlement cash will run through cash from operations in the fourth quarter. ", "No surprises in cash flow -- it is driven by earnings and working capital is at the levels that we expected. Cash from investing included $88 million capital and internal software spending, $138 million for acquisitions to support our expanding distribution strategy, and $138 million partial payment into an escrow account for our Carlson litigation settlement. ", "We have been active in share repurchase as we repurchased $377 million in the quarter and $711 million year-to-date, approximately 50 million shares. We announced an additional $1 billion board authorization, which gives us approval to repurchase a total of $1.7 billion. We plan on being active going forward, consistent with cash flow and appropriate leverage, and at the same time maximize shareholder value. Lastly, we paid out $39 million for our quarterly dividend. ", "Overall, a very good cash performance and we continue to be dedicated to strong liquidity and investment grade rating. Next slide. ", "Our business model is driven by annuity. In times of economic uncertainty, this provides us with stable revenue stream and a good source of cash flow. The leading indicators for our annuity continue to be positive. As we go through this score card, keep in mind that machines in the field, as well as page data do not include printers, developing markets, and Global Imaging, and all revenue measures exclude Global Imaging. Including these items would improve the results. ", "As our channels of distribution evolve, this limits our ability to measure pages and machines in the field and it does not provide a complete picture of post sale dynamics. Going forward, we will need to supplement the scorecard as DMO and Global Imaging lead the way in office and are too significant to not include. ", "Our estimate of their impact on digital pages would show a change from down 1% to approximately up 1%. Looking first at the top left box, digital revenue in the quarter was up 8%, MIF was up 6%, and digital pages were down 1%, but would be approximately up 1% when we include DMO, Global Imaging, and printers. Color continues to drive digital growth with 16% revenue, 37% MIF, and 29% page growth. This, along with the positive impact of color on price per page, continues to provide us a great opportunity, as color only represents 21% of the MIF and 16% of the pages. ", "Black and white MIF is stable, with declines in pages being driven in part by the transition of pages into color and color-capable devices. Black and white MIF stability, along with our strong color growth, is a positive indicator for future annuity, and Global Imaging, DMO, and printers would increase this. ", "We also continue to see strong growth in services, another key post sale indicator and an important element of our growth strategy. Services annuity is up 8% in the first half and we see the growth continuing as more and more customers look to Xerox to help them reduce their costs by optimizing and simplifying their document management. These leading indicators, as well as the strong DMO, Global Imaging, and printer performance, reflect well on continued annuity performance. ", "So in summary, we delivered earnings and strong cash flow. We delivered shareholder value with acquisitions, quarterly dividend, and share repurchase. We invested in coverage. We took actions to improve gross profit margin and we are maintaining our full year guidance. ", "Now I\u2019ll give it back to Anne. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thanks, Larry. So we continue to say it, but it is an important message to leave you with, and that\u2019s our annuity-based business really is the driver of our profitable growth and it is an asset in tougher economic times. With the leverage from color and services, we are confident in the sustainable strength of this model through the long-term. So far this year, we\u2019ve launched 23 products, including a significant refresh of our production line and expanded offerings for the SMB marketplace, and we\u2019ll start to see the benefit of these innovation investments later this year as equipment activity drives page volume, pages that help boost post sale -- you know the story. ", "In addition, our broader distribution, developing markets, and Global Imaging organizations are rapidly growing our brand presence in SMB, and with the additional $1 billion in share repurchase authorization, you will see us continue to buy back Xerox stock. ", "And at the same time, we\u2019re managing the balance sheet with a close eye on the bottom line, making the marketing investments needed to drive growth while controlling costs and ensuring flexibility in our model so we can deliver on earnings expectations and generate strong operating cash flow. ", "So we expect Q3 earnings in the range of $0.28 to $0.30 per share, and full year EPS of $1.26 to $1.30. ", "So thank you all for joining us today and Larry and Ursula and I will be pleased to take your questions now. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Good morning. A couple of questions, the first, if you could talk a little bit about if you hadn\u2019t seen the dip in color production demand prior to the launch of the iGen 4, any idea on how the quarter might have tracked what your production color might have looked like? I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of sort of the magnitude of impact from delays in installs. ", "And then also, if you can give us any update on demand for some of the new products, like the 700, that would be great. Thanks. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay. If we look historically at our revenue growth in color production, it obviously had a significant impact on the quarter. Second quarter is our second strongest quarter in the year, so obviously it would have changed the story significantly. ", "I will say that I would look at it and say in the U.S., I do think that there\u2019s more economic content, quite frankly, to the production story but in terms of Europe and DMO, there\u2019s no question that we had demand we couldn\u2019t fulfill from the announcements of the new product. So it would have helped in a number of ways -- obviously it would have helped equipment sell revenue. It\u2019s our higher margin area of the business, so it would have helped margin as well, and it would have helped color growth rate. So there\u2019s no question -- I think you know, Shannon, that we decided to really go out more aggressively in Drupa because we didn\u2019t want to miss the window, and particularly in light of competitors pre-announcing products that weren\u2019t available, quite frankly, for a longer time. We thought it was a wise thing to do to go out and announce products, get the momentum built, since we\u2019re bringing these products to market late in the third quarter. So we will see some benefit in the third quarter, a lot in the fourth quarter. ", "The 700 is the product that\u2019s clearly exceeded our expectations. Early demand says that it\u2019s way more than we had anticipated, it\u2019s priced right, it\u2019s in a sweet spot in terms of entry production color. We\u2019re now working on increasing the supply as aggressively as possible so that we can take advantage of this demand through the balance of the year. But I think, Ursula, it would be fair to say we\u2019ll install every single one we get. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "We have already installed every single one that we have gotten, and we are working, as Anne said, on getting more. The up-tick in the 700 shows primarily in Europe. That\u2019s where we\u2019ve launched it first. We\u2019ll launch it in the U.S. and some of the DMO territories in the third quarter of this year, late -- early fourth quarter of this year and we\u2019ll see an additional tick-up in that segment as well. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "And then just sort of a follow-up to -- assuming that the color production demand remains relatively solid, at least in countries other than the U.S., and then sort of looking at the numbers that you provided, are you sort of taking a conservative outlook, given all the economic factors that are out there? Because when you look at your EPS guidance, especially with the benefit from lower tax and continued aggressive share repurchase, I mean, is this basically better to be conservative and prudent than aggressive kind of an attitude, looking at your numbers, given some of the tailwinds you probably will have in the second half?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, we\u2019re certainly not looking for any economic improvements balance of year, so should there be some, then I think we would clearly take advantage of some of the upside that it would bring, but that\u2019s not something that we\u2019ve considered as we\u2019ve done our outlook for balance of year. ", "It\u2019s an interesting scenario because the pressure on margin is coming from mix and the good news on tax rate is coming also from geographical mix, so there\u2019s a little bit of a trade-off there, Shannon, in the sense that the lower tax rate is being generated literally by the weakness in the U.S., which is the higher tax area, and the fact that the benefit from the disproportionate amount of the revenue that\u2019s coming from the emerging markets and Europe. ", "So I think it\u2019s fair to say that as the U.S. gets stronger, we will see that tax rate potentially go up a bit as well. But what we\u2019re looking at through the balance of the year is basically what we\u2019ve seen through the first half of the year. ", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachmann with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. I wanted to ask just a couple of questions, if I could; Anne, could you just talk about how you are thinking about, given that economic backdrop in the mix, how you are thinking about pricing on both the production side and the office side through the end of the year? And what risk do you see in the implications to gross margins that have ticked down over the course of the last four quarters, five quarters? If you could address that as you -- as it relates to the demand environment. Thanks. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think we would view the pricing environment, it\u2019s important to say, by the way, that pricing moderated a bit in second quarter. You may remember we were pretty aggressive, particularly in the mono-production area, so we brought that back a bit and think it was a wise thing to do. So pricing did moderate a little bit but it\u2019s still clearly a source of pressure on margin and we would expect that to continue. ", "Now, importantly it\u2019s primarily on the equipment sales side still, so getting the install still is a priority and maximizing our channels of distribution is a priority, so -- but we don\u2019t expect the pricing environment to deteriorate much more, nor improve significantly for balance of year. But I have to say that if you look at margins, I would say that for the balance of the year, we have a number of things that are going in our direction for margin improvement. The first is the impact of the restructuring. The second is, as I mentioned, production color, which clearly is a helper in terms of improving performance in production color. And the third is as we get into the second half of the year, that potential improvement in the ratio of SAG and RD&E is also a helper, so I think we have more helping us than hurting us but I don\u2019t think pricing will be the major helper going forward. It will come from restructuring, better performance in production color, and some improving ratios on SAG and RD&E. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. If I could just ask one more than, Anne, I want to change subjects for a second; I wonder if you could address how you think some of your acquisitions have performed, particularly in the software side, things like Amici, and how you think about your acquisition portfolio going forward, away from the distribution side. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, I think we would tell you that the biggest and most significant acquisition we\u2019ve done is Global Imaging and we continue to be more than pleased with Global Imaging. They had a very strong quarter. Amici, which is now known as Xerox Litigation Services, is a great performer. It\u2019s high margin, high value services business that we think still has lots of legs to grow. ", "The XMS, which is the mortgage processing business, as you would expect is under some pressure but the reality is that what we\u2019ve invested in clearly is going to be even more important to the mortgage industry going forward, which is a systemic digital mortgage processing platform that clearly has already got market share in the mortgage industry and I think will only gain, so we think that\u2019s an investment that will yield more in the future. ", "The other one is XMPie, which we\u2019re thrilled with. I mean, XMPie continues to be a great acquisition. Our graphic communications space is a world that\u2019s driven by applications and primarily personalization and to have XMPie in our portfolio is terrific. ", "So all in all, I think we\u2019ve been careful. I think we\u2019ve set our sights high but I think our acquisition process has yielded great results. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "And so Anne, with that as a backdrop and then I\u2019ll cede the floor, but would it make sense in your mind if you\u2019ve been successful in those areas, which I presume also would eventually lead to an improved margin profile, why not go after more on that side of the fence, rather than the distribution side which doesn\u2019t necessarily diversify your revenue streams?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, I think we are. I think this is more a question of finding the right properties. We are looking and saying to the extent we can do more, particularly on the vertical services side than the software side, we\u2019re very open to that. I wouldn\u2019t, by the way -- by the way, whatever we do in distribution becomes a channel not just for our traditional business but it\u2019s a channel for our services business and we are demonstrating that with Global already, that we\u2019re changing the boundaries of what those channels distribute with a wider portfolio of offerings. ", "So in one sense, distribution just gives us a bigger pipe to take all of our offerings through, so it\u2019s a driver of growth for the entire portfolio of the business. But I would look and say I think we are selective and we are totally open to acquisitions that will help us on the services and software side and continue to look at them and have them in our pipeline as well. ", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jay Vleeschhouwer with Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. Good morning. Anne, how are you thinking about the continuity of growth for DMO, specifically post sales within DMO? You\u2019ve been seeing some good mid-teens growth there year over year, but at least in the second half of this year, the comps do start getting quite a bit harder versus the second half of last year, so maybe you could talk about how you are thinking about DMO, both on the production and office side. ", "Secondly, with respect to the gross margin, is the 39% to 40% just the reality of this year that you have to acknowledge, or is this a leading indicator of another reset of the gross margin in future, notwithstanding some potentially favorable mix trends?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "On DMO, I think -- I mean, we did see extraordinary growth this quarter, 18% to 19% growth is pretty ambitious but if you looked at where we are investing, particularly on the marketing and the covered side, you would see it disproportionately allocated to DMO, so our intent is to continue to capture growth in DMO by investing in future sources of growth. And I think the model is very different from the rest of the world. I mean, when we look at our post sale in the rest of the world, a lot of it is driven by document services, technical services, financing. And DMO, it\u2019s really a consumable post sale model which does yield a higher set of returns in the post sale than you have from the blended post sale stream you see in the rest of the world, Jay, so you will continue to see kind of a higher ratio of post sale in DMO because of the makeup of the kind of razor, razor blade model that we have in DMO. ", "So I\u2019m not suggesting that we\u2019ll see 18% potentially over the long-term but I think we have double-digit growth in DMO for a long time to come and we\u2019re investing and making sure that we\u2019ve got the ability to get it. And I would say that we have in the services and the production market, we clearly have not yet really capitalized on the opportunity going forward there. I know Ursula and I were both at Drupa and I would tell you, the excitement from the developing markets on the high-end technologies, and even I think the order rate from DMO, Ursula, was higher than it was from Europe. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "We are impressed at the pick-up of the high-end technology, particularly color technology, in the territories in DMO -- Russia, Brazil, Mexico, the Eurasia companies, India. So all of the production equipment actually plays very well in those areas. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "And on the margin, I think we would characterize 39 to 40 as the reality of the economic mix that we are seeing right now. And that\u2019s why I wanted to kind of make clear that when you\u2019ve got weakness in U.S., weakness in production, you are really looking at your highest margin businesses, kind of not producing their fair share, and the extraordinary strength we\u2019re seeing from DMO and Global and services, which are all doing very, very well as lower margin businesses is really driving it. As the U.S. and production comes back, there\u2019s no question that the gross margin will improve, so we basically believe this is a temporary outlook, one that we are adjusting our business model to so that we can maintain our expectation to outlook, but that it will be conditional to economic improvement in the U.S. and -- but for as long a time as we\u2019re dealing with that, we believe we\u2019ve got the right actions in place so that we can really not have to deteriorate the overall business returns. ", "On the flipside of that, Jay, as the margin gets stronger with U.S., then you will see probably a tax rate change as well. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Additionally, Anne, can you comment on any areas where you feel that you need to capture or perhaps recapture share? We\u2019ve been seeing some interesting trends in both office and production with respect to Canon\u2019s numbers, Ricoh\u2019s numbers, Oce and continuous feed -- you know, where are the holes that you need to try to run through?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think, by the way, if you looked at the last share results through Q1, we actually grew share almost everywhere, which gives us one area of focus that we are focused on like crazy, and that\u2019s the entry production color area, and particularly the low-end of the entry production color area, and that\u2019s why the introduction of the 700 color press is so critically important and the success of it, because that is our path to be very aggressive in gaining back share in that area. But other than that, I have to tell you we are really pleased with share across the board. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "All right and then lastly, the usual question on vertical markets, graphic arts, transactional, public sector, financial, and so forth?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think the only one that we would break out would be graphic arts, and graphic arts only in the U.S., and that clearly is feeling the pressure but any of the other industrial verticals, government, we think none of that is material in terms of the results. ", "Jay Vleeschhouwer - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Banc of America.", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Thanks for taking my call. Just a quick question, I guess, on kind of intertwined installs and margins. Just interested in where you guys were maybe most surprised, or I guess what led to the -- I guess kind of to the biggest surprise in the install activity this quarter? I\u2019m going to sort of assume that you guys probably -- or did you expect some delays in purchasing, sort of ahead of Drupa or were you surprised by that? ", "And then secondarily, depending on the answer to that question, did that also lead to I guess some of the sequential decline in the margins, which I am sort of assuming you were a bit surprised by, because I got the sense coming out of the last quarter that you were expecting at least a slight up-tick sequentially in the gross margin. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "So let me just talk about installs first, and I think that we clearly -- I can\u2019t say we were totally surprised by it but the production color install rate was way off certainly our traditional production color rate. Now, we definitely changed our minds about bringing the production color products to Drupa that weren\u2019t available to Q3 and we did it to position ourselves competitively. It\u2019s the right thing to do. We couldn\u2019t miss that window to create excitement about the new products based upon what competitors were doing, but it definitely put a hold on the vast majority of our production color orders in the second quarter. ", "So it\u2019s a surprise, I think, in terms of where we thought we were at the beginning of the year and certainly first quarter, but once we assessed the state of Drupa, we made the decision, we knew there would be an impact, and we certainly got it, and it really is due to the strength of the refreshed portfolio. ", "So that\u2019s the only one. If you look through all the office categories, we had 10% in growth in office black and white, I think about 35% in color MFP -- I mean, we\u2019ve been looking at results like Lexmark\u2019s 12% decline in laser printers; we had a 12% increase in color printers, so we would look at it and say office was strong and our weakness was production color and I guess we sort of did it to ourselves but this is a full year, not just a quarter and we think that\u2019s the right thing. Ursula. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "And the major focus area in production color was the high-end of production color, where we accelerated the introduction or the showing of iGen 4. In the DocuColor 700 space, our activity in that space was flat on a yearly basis, so we didn\u2019t see a decline. But what we have seen is a significant pick-up in orders or demand for the 700, so that should add to that already solid base. The iGen 4 is the place that we actually decided to accelerate and saw delayed decisions for that. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Got it, so -- ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "You wanted me to comment on margins, sequential margin?", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Sure, yeah, that\u2019d be great. Thanks. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think when we talked about margin last quarter, we said that we would see the impacts of restructuring in the second half of the year, so we really had almost no impacts in terms of restructuring in second quarter. It was a quarter of implementation and I think understanding the impacts of the production color business on margin, you know, had we not had that dip in production color, I think you would have seen a sequential improvement in margin based upon the strengths and the impact of that part of the portfolio. But we haven\u2019t lost it. It\u2019s literally coming in the second half so this is one where I think our projection on margin, we can be confident in improvement because of the flow-through, both from the pent-up demand on the new production products, as well as the restructuring impacts. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Great, and just a quick follow-up, if I could; Oce\u2019s continuous feed numbers weren\u2019t great for the quarter. I know that\u2019s been an area that you guys have been talking about, or at least pointing to as an area of expansion. And I know -- I don\u2019t doubt at all that that\u2019s going to continue to be the case, but have you seen anything in that market through the June Q that has maybe dampened the enthusiasm around that market, your opportunity to sort of go into that market in a bigger way in the second half of the year?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Absolutely nothing that dampens our enthusiasm at all; actually, everything that we have seen, especially on the color continuous feeds, has boosted our enthusiasm on that market segment and our ability to be competitive in that segment. ", "Ananda Baruah - Banc of America ", "Okay, thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. Back to the gross margin, hoping to get a little color on the decline in post sale gross margin. On a year-on-year basis, that was down over one percentage point, and you haven\u2019t given much color on that. What was the primary driver of that margin erosion?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "The strength of services really drove -- I mean, that was the answer on post sale, nothing else. Services does come at a lower margin and because of the weakness -- this is right back to the same weakness in U.S., particularly high-end hardware, and the strength of our services business combined to have an impact on the post sale gross margin. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Are you seeing any pull-back at all in printed pages amongst your production, your highest volume production printing customers?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Yeah, I think on black and white pages, there is no question. You saw it in Larry\u2019s chart that we are seeing some accelerated declines on the black and white pages side, and that is primarily a U.S. phenomenon. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "How does that weakening page volume kind of outlook or scenario impact your outlook for equipment sales going forward in production? And related, you just showed about 5% declines in equipment revenue growth on a year-on-year basis, what should we think about as a target for the back half of the year as an organic equipment revenue growth number?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think that this would get back to the question is what kind of assumptions have we put into our outlook for the balance of the year and we are not expecting U.S. black and white pages to improve. That is something that until the U.S. economy starts to improve, I think there will be a relationship on the page side, not so much on color, by the way. Color seems to be holding up a lot better than the black and white page, which is more the transactional side of the business. So I think we\u2019ve made the assumptions that it is what it is until we see some kind of economic improvement. ", "On the actual equipment sales side, which is unrelated from the page discussion, I think we should see improvement based upon the fact that we\u2019ve got the benefit of the new product portfolio in the second half of the year versus what we saw in the second quarter of the year. So we would look and say -- we don\u2019t expect equipment sales to be a robust growth factor but it should be improving based upon the new product introductions. I mean, that\u2019s really going to help but we still think our model is a post-sale model and you are going to see overall revenue growth clearly leveraged through the post sale stream. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Final question is for Larry; Larry, bad debt expense was up slightly sequentially. Can you talk about your collections and customer credit quality, if you are seeing any meaningful changes there? That would be helpful. Thanks a lot. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "We haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change that we would call material in the customer payments here. Bad debts goes up -- revenue goes up, bad debts goes up and it\u2019s just that.  ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. Good morning. A couple of questions; getting back to the commentary on pricing, Anne or Larry, could you talk a little more about some of the drivers to why the pricing moderated in the quarter? Did you have some upside in other areas that allowed you to pull back in production monochrome? And if there was upside in certain areas, how sustainable should we think about those drivers going forward?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Mark, I think when we talked about it in the first quarter, we talked about the fact that the pricing pressure came through selected big deals. That\u2019s where you see sometimes the biggest impact on pricing. So generally what we don\u2019t do is kind of, if you will, reduce the water level for the entire portfolio. We try to do it selectively to win light house deals, which gives us the opportunity to manage it going forward, and what we did was clearly just manage and not offer the same level of pricing in Q2 as Q1, and we had the opportunity to do that. ", "You know, as we look at pricing investments across the board, you know, still under 10%, which is not untraditional for us and better than Q1, but it was mostly big deal driven versus any particular category of product. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay, and then getting back to the production refresh, Ursula and yourself talked about the demand outstripping supply right now. How should we think about your ability to perform, just given you are implementing a considerable level of restructuring activities in the second half? Is there any wiggle room to restructure if the macro gets worse, just given that you are trying to unleash this new product set with some pretty exciting demand levels at this point. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "On the demand side and the supply side, we are confident that we can meet the demand as we ramp up the production line. It\u2019s a pretty standard product introduction cycle that we go through, so we have very high demand in the 700. That demand will be met with supply as we [come to production curve] [inaudible] so -- and the restructuring wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with that at all. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Remember, the restructuring is very focused. It has literally I think zero impact in terms of our ability to execute against the plan, and I think that if the economy gets worse, I think that\u2019s something we actually are pretty good at. We literally know how to deal with anticipating and making sure that we take advantage of any cost opportunities to make sure that we don\u2019t, quite frankly, disappoint in terms of bottom line expectations. So you can be assured that we have all of our contingency approaches understood, hopefully not to implement but we know what to do. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I think in a price performance technology company, you have to constantly reduce cost and the only way to do that is through some small kinds of restructuring, and we\u2019ve done that a lot, and we\u2019re prepared to do it in the future and we would do it within the guidance that we\u2019ve given. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you. One more question, if I could; any update -- I may have missed it, so I apologize, but any update on the distribution inventory activities across the U.S.? I remember last quarter, you did talk about some of the distributors having some hesitancy to take on inventory. Has that changed or not?", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "I think we talked about specifically in the reseller channel and I think we would say it\u2019s a continuing trend. It has not worsened but there\u2019s no question there\u2019s a very conservative approach to inventory in the channels, but I would not say its worsened from Q1. ", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Thank you for taking the question. I had two questions for you. I was hoping that you could give us a little bit more color on the timing of shipments and installs for the new production products in the third quarter. Is it going to be fairly linear or it is going to be heavily back-end loaded in the quarter?", "And then secondly, Larry, I was hoping that you could give me a little bit more detail on the specific types of costs that were affected by the restructuring actions in Q2. Thank you. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay, timing on the -- you know, absolutely will be back-end loaded in Q3, so we\u2019ll get as much as we can done but primarily I think a September kind of delivery for, for example, iGen 4 and the 5000. Particularly, I think you will see a more steady 700 availability, although not available until probably Q4 or September or Q4 in the U.S. So definitely back-end loaded, that\u2019s comprehended within our outlook. It\u2019s why we know that we\u2019ve got a lot of momentum, particularly going into the fourth quarter as we look at the production business. But we\u2019re staged and ready and we\u2019ll take as much advantage as we can in third quarter.  ", "On costs and restructuring, Larry. ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "On costs and restructuring, what we said was that two-thirds of it was gross profit related, and that had to do with supply chain and also service, rate-fixed service were the two primary areas. ", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you. Last question, I think, we have time for. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Caroline Sabbagha with Lehman Brothers.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks. A question on the increased share buy-back authorization; I guess the question is why now? You still had $700 million left on it, which is kind of the level you\u2019ve been running at for the first half. Does it imply that you are going to do more than the $700 million for the rest of the year that you had outstanding?", "And associated with that, given what we think may be a bigger buy-back than you intended in the beginning of the year, the incremental cash-out for the litigation settlement, what is your view looking out 12 months or so on where you want the balance sheet, what sort of cash levels do you feel comfortable with, what sort of leverage do you feel comfortable with?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well, I think -- and I think we\u2019ve said this, Carol, but basically somewhere around $750 million as a cash balance is what we\u2019ve tried to do. We\u2019ve generally fallen into around $800 million, if you look back at the last quarter since we said that. We probably could do it at less than that but that\u2019s sort of a comfort zone number. ", "I think we just saw some opportunity to be active with share repurchase because of the share price, and so that\u2019s what we did, sort of bought ahead, maybe a little bit ahead of the cash flow in anticipation that we really have a strong fourth quarter on cash flow in this company and that we can meet what we say there. And I think the authorization was just simply a statement of the fact that we are kind of dedicated to that idea, that share repurchase is important for us and just increases it and the timeframe might increase because of the higher amount that we had there. ", "Share repurchase is done and consistent with cash flow, so -- as far as debt levels, I think in the second quarter, we had a seven-to-one ratio of debt in our financing business leverage, and we had about $400 million or $500 million of core debt. And somewhere around that is a comfort zone of where we think core debt should be. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Okay. And then one quick question on the product side -- we\u2019ve been talking, or you guys have been talking since the analyst meeting last November about the higher end solid ink product coming out in 2008 and I think second half of the year. Where are we in that processed? And I know you were testing out the price elasticity in solid ink with the existing products -- again, what have your results showed?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We are on track to bring solid ink [up market] at the end of 2008 with market introductions and the financial impact in the beginning of 2009. And as far as our test-out goes, we are still testing out, obviously, but the feedback has been good, strong on our color MFP, lower on color MFP introduction that we made last year, so on track for both ends. ", "Caroline Sabbagha - Lehman Brothers", "Terrific. Thank you. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Okay. Thank you, Carol and thanks to all of your for participating today. Have a great day. ", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation and you may now disconnect. Good day.

She is joined by Ursula Burns, President, and Larry Zimmerman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call, Xerox's executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor.  At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being tape recorded.  Other taping and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.  After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mrs. Mulcahy.  Mrs. Mulcahy, you may begin. ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Thank you.  And good morning and thanks to all of you joining us today.  During our call today we will focus on what we know is top of mind for you, the strength of our financial positions, the resiliency of our business model, how the economy is impacting our business today, and how we are positioned to weather economic challenges ahead while strengthening our competitive leadership.", "So if you will turn to slide four, we will review the current dynamics of our business.  From our perspective the economic challenges are primarily impacting our business with large enterprises, especially in the United States and to some extent in the United Kingdom.  ", "We are seeing a good deal of this pressure on sales of our high volume production systems.  Continued strong demand for our products for small and mid-sized businesses is helping to offset this economic impact.  We are generating a solid return on our investments through our developing markets and global imaging operations.  And we continue to benefit from demand for our outsourcing and document services.", "Certainly a broad worldwide presence helps us in today's environment.  So does a business model that is annuity-based.  More than 70% of our revenue is recurring, providing stability in tough economic conditions.  This annuity is a primary source of our operating cash and we are consistently generating solid cash flow with modest capital investments.", "To date operating cash flow is 754 million, including 260 million in the third quarter.  We recognize that the changes in our revenue mix, both from geographic and product line perspectives require us to reduce our cost base so we can maintain growth investments and increase earnings.  We are focusing on operational improvements through additional restructuring that will improve operating margins.  As in past years we expect the fourth quarter to be our strongest for cash flow.", "But as we look ahead we remain confident in the strength of our financial position.  We are not immune to economic issues and the unpredictability of these coming months will likely make for a challenging environment.  But we are better positioned than most and believe we have the flexibility to manage our business successfully through today's challenges as well as serving the long-term value of our shareholders.", "So let me take a moment now and review our Q3 results.  Larry then will share more detail about our financial results.  I will discuss our Q4 expectations and then Larry, Ursula and I would be pleased to take your questions.", "If you turn to slide five we will summarize our third quarter performance.  We are reporting earnings of $0.29 per share for the third quarter.  That includes a $0.04 benefit from tax settlements partially offset by $0.01 of restructuring.  Revenue has remained stable over the past few quarters, even as economic pressures have increased.  Total revenue of 4.4 billion was up 2% and flat at constant currency.", "Despite seeing pressure on page volume in large enterprises, wholesale revenue growth stayed steady and was up 3% with a 1 point currency benefit.  Again, where we are experiencing the most impact from the economy is in production equipment sales which led to a decline in equipment revenue of 4% at constant currency, a slight sequential improvement from Q2 as we begin to see the benefit of new products that started shipping in September.", "I will show you in a moment, install activity was relatively healthy in key areas like office color.  And that is an important indicator of our future success.  More installs of Xerox technology help to fuel our profitable post-sale revenue.  But as install activity and post-sale are very closely linked and flow through to annuity for the long term.", "Gross margin was 39.2% of revenue, consistent with the prior quarter, but down about a point from last year.  And selling, administrative and general expenses were 26% of revenue, up a bit more than half a point.  ", "The price and mix dynamic continues.  Strengths in developing markets and services put pressure on gross margins but also resulted in a favorable adjusted tax rate from the geographic shift in revenues.  At the same time we have maintained our marketing and sales coverage investments so we can build on our industry leadership.  ", "However, to better align our operations with the changing dynamics in our business, we will continue to reduce costs across the board.  These activities will accelerate in the fourth quarter helping us build more flexibility in our business so we can improve operating margins and earnings while maintaining investments to drive growth.  As a result we will take a restructuring charge of about 400 million in the fourth quarter.  Larry will talk more about this in a moment.", "And as I mentioned, we are managing the balance sheet well, generating 260 million in cash from operations this quarter.  So if you will turn to slide six, we will further review our revenue.  Here is a more detailed view of our revenue results for Q3 where you will see the direct impact of the economy on our production revenue and the lift from our expanded SMB coverage in office.  ", "In production revenue was down 1% in the quarter, including a 2% benefit from currency.  The challenges in production were primarily U.S.-based, with the beginning of some pressure in the UK on our sales to large enterprises.  The biggest impact is in production monochrome with 11% install activity decline.", "During the quarter we had only a few weeks of benefit from the launch of Xerox's iGen4 production press and the Xerox 700 entry color press, both of which just became available worldwide in September.  We are encouraged by early signs of demand for these products.  In fact activity was particularly strong in Europe and we expect additional momentum from these launches on a global basis during Q4 and into 2009.", "In the office, Q3 revenue was up 3% with a two point currency benefit.  And that was led by strong growth in global imaging systems and our developing markets.  Expanded sales coverage to the SMB market through global imaging and resellers and agents and concessionaires contributed a 15% increase in activity for black and white multi-function devices and as we continue to drive demands for color in the office with installs of color multi-function systems up 23%.", "Color revenue grew 5% in the third quarter.  Color pages were up 27% and now represent 17% of total pages printed on Xerox technology.  These results exclude the benefit from global imaging systems.  As mentioned earlier, growth in our developing markets is providing positive leverage to our overall business, with GMO revenue up 15% in the quarter from positive performance in all regions.  ", "Equally important is the continued growth of our document management services.  Through Xerox Global Services we are providing clients with more cost-effective ways to manage their document technology, convert paper to digital and simply document intensive work processes, especially in industries like legal, healthcare, education and insurance.", "Through Q3, annuity from a multiyear global service contracts is up 6%.  We're scaling the business not only through industry focused-efforts such as our Xerox Litigation Services for eDiscovery in the legal space, but also through key partnerships with leading IT companies.  ", "In fact, Xerox recently signed a worldwide agreement with IBM that will leverage our document management expertise to support back office functions.  Xerox Imaging Services will give IBM and its customer's digital access to better manage and use information currently stored in millions of paper-based documents.  ", "We're forming similar alliances around the world that played out industry-leading strength in end-to-end document management.  So now I'll turn it over to Larry for a deeper dive on our financials and then I'll return to discuss Q4 expectations.  Larry.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Thank you Anne, and good morning.  In the third quarter we delivered EPS of $0.29 and $260 million cash flow from operations.  While cash flow continues its positive performance in trend with $754 million year-to-date, earnings-per-share were helped by the positive effect of prior-year tax settlements.  ", "The challenging areas of our business that put pressure on results were a significant slow-down in U.S. large enterprise accounts, as well as continuing mix pressure on gross profit margin as growth came from lower-margin parts of our business, geographies, products and services.", "We believe that given this continued environment and trend it is appropriate to accelerate cost and expense reductions and announce an approximately $400 million restructuring charge for the fourth quarter.  ", "Work is in progress to identify the specifics but the size of the charge and the required savings going forward are clear.  In addition, I believe it's important to also focus on some of the positive aspects of the quarter.  Our annuity model yielded 2% constant currency recurring revenue growth which drove good cash performance, excellent growth in developing markets and global imaging.", "Solid performance in Europe, good overall office performance, continued growth in our services business.  These positive results, coupled with our restructuring cost and expense actions will protect us on the down side and give us an opportunity on the upside going forward. ", "So let's go through a few slides that I hope will add some clarity.  I will start with cash flow, talk a little bit about liquidity and receivables given the current environment, and then go to the P: &L and end with the annuity recurring revenue score card.", "Slide 8:  We are pleased with third quarter results of $242 million for cash flow and $260 million total cash from operations with year-to-date core cash flow at almost $700 million.  We are on track to meet our full-year guidance of $1.1 billion core cash flow, allowing for the litigation we talked about in Q1.  ", "As of October 1st, all of the costs and settlement cash is in escrow.  Settlement cash will run through cash from operations in the fourth quarter.  Cash flow is driven by earnings and includes $205 million of pension payment.  Inventory and accounts receivable are on track and will significantly contribute to fourth quarter cash flow.  ", "Capital and internal software was $85 million in the third quarter and $244 million year-to-date and consistent with $350 million for full-year.  Cash from investing also includes the litigation cash moving to escrow.  Cash from financing includes share repurchase of $91 million and dividend of $37 million.  And our cash balance is $873 million. ", "Though as we talk about good cash performance, I thought I would spend a slide on two questions I get asked.  Slide 9.  The first question is what are the debt maturities for unsecured notes supporting our financing business and second, what is the trend of receivable write-offs?  ", "Let's start with two points.  First we have consistently delivered significant cash flow from operations and cash balances.  It is the strength of our annuity recurring revenue model.  You can see in the top left box $1.4 billion to $1.9 billion cash from operations over the last three years.  And we will do it again this year, factoring in the impact of securities litigation.", "Second, bottom left, our debt maturities are spread evenly over the next 10 years and are in line with cash flow.  2009 is made up of $934 million of notes due January 15th, 2009, $150 million of notes due December 2009 and $448 million in private placements with a final maturity of $2,022, which is included because there is a put option in third quarter 2009.", "If we move to the bottom right you can see that in addition to our $1.4 to $1.9 billion of operating cash flow every year, we have a $2 billion revolving credit facility through 2012, with only $248 million drawn at September 30th, 2008.  ", "We also have a significant secured credit line commitment that we have not used in almost three years that goes through the end of 2010.  The $1.4 billion and $250 million private placement talked to the access we have had in credit markets in the last five months.  ", "So given the 10-year spread of our debt, our strong cash generating capabilities, particularly in the fourth quarter, our access to capital markets as well as over $2.5 billion of available borrowing, I think it is clear that our debt is well-supported and that we approach it in the same way going forward. ", "Lastly, top right, our receivable write-offs and reserves are consistently below 1% of revenue and the dollar growth is largely associated with revenue growth.  We inspect these reserves, along with write-off experience every quarter on a conservative basis and have not seen a material change in trend or aging.  ", "Now I would like to move to the P&L, slide 10.  Revenue for the quarter was flat at constant currency, with 2% growth in post-sale revenue and a 4% decline in equipment revenue also at constant currency.  Given the U.S. enterprise environment, the revenue performance was driven by developing markets, global imaging, office and services.  ", "These growth areas offset U.S. challenges as our investments in them paid off and kept our revenue on trend.  This did, however, keep pressure gross profit margin as it decline nine-tenths of a point.  We believe our cost reduction efforts will help improve this over time.  ", "RD&E continues on a consistent basis and will also benefit from the efficiency improvement.  SAG grew $47 million with $18 million of the increase due to selling and $10 million due to currency.  We believe these selling investments are yielding and are an investment in our future.  Bad debt provision also impacted SAG, but as discussed, is within our historical range as a percent of revenue.  ", "Other net increase reflects the year-over-year impact from gains or losses on currency of $17 million.  We had $14 million of restructuring in the quarter and a 6% tax rate, driven by the conclusion of prior years as well as higher content of non-U.S. profit and a lower effective tax rate.  This lower tax rate will have a positive cash effect in the future.  The tax rate, net of restructuring, helped $0.03 in the quarter and would have been 24% without it.  Our EPS was $0.29.  ", "Slide 11.  As mentioned earlier, we are accelerating our restructuring efforts and will implement an approximately $400 million charge in the fourth quarter.  Significant work is underway to identify the specifics.  The focus is to improve efficiency and effectiveness of our operations from our support infrastructure, delivery of our product and services as well as development and engineering.", "These actions will have significant savings in 2009 of 200 million and ending in the savings against the charge will have about an $80 million incremental use of cash in '09.  These are regressive actions in challenging times that also will play out well as opportunities present themselves in the future.", "Slide 12.  In spite of the challenges from the economic environment, our recurring revenue business model continues to improve and point favorably to the future.  As Anne mentioned earlier, page volumes, particularly in the U.S. enterprise, have been a bit pressured, but this has had only a marginal effect on post-sale revenues.  ", "Post-sale revenue growth at constant currency was 2% in third quarter, and year-to-date post-sale constant currency growth is 3%, adjusted for global imaging.  The leading indicators for our annuity remain solid.  ", "As we go through this scorecard, keep in mind that machines in the field as well as page data do not include printers, developing market countries, and global imaging, and all revenue measures exclude global imagining.  Including these items would improve the results.", "As we discussed during last quarter, we incorporated a new metric for total pages to provide an estimate of what our page growth is if DMO, printers, and global imaging are included.  Looking first at the top left box, digital revenue in the quarter was up 6%, machines in the field was up 6% and digital pagers were down 1% or up 2% including DMO, global imagining and printers.", "Power continues to drive digital growth with 14% revenue, 34% machines in the field and 28% page growth.  Although color equipment revenue growth was not as robust in this environment, the post-sale annuity revenue in pages had excellent growth.  In addition, the positive impact of color on price per page will continue to be an opportunity as color represents only 22% of machines in the field and 16% of pages.  ", "Black and white digital pages therefore are stable, with declines in pages being driven in part by the transition of pages onto color and color-capable devices.  Black and white machines in the field stability along with color growth and the solid installed performance Anne reviewed earlier are all positive indicators for future annuity.  ", "We also continue to see good growth in services.  Services annuity is up 6% year-to-date and we see this growth continuing as more and more customers look to Xerox to help them to reduce their costs by optimizing and simplifying document infrastructure.  ", "With over 70% of our revenues coming from post-sale, these positive indicators support the resiliency of our business model and stability of our revenues.  This stability of recurring revenue, coupled with our actions to manage cost and expense will yield earnings expansion and cash generation going forward.", "Now I'll give it back to Anne.", "Anne Mulcahy ", "Thanks, Larry.  So wrapping up, as we look at Q4, we're assuming continued economic challenges, resulting in pressure on margins, through the shift in our revenue mix, as well as currency headwinds.  Restructuring we took earlier this year would help to offset some of this pressure.  ", "Again, the fourth quarter is seasonally our strongest for operating cash.  We also expect and are already seeing some benefit in Q4 from our new production systems, as well as more demand for the broader line of competitively priced office printers and MFPs we launched this year.", "We expect to deliver fourth quarter earnings-per-share in the range of $0.03 to $0.05.  That includes $0.31 of restructuring.  Excluding restructuring, Q4 earnings expectations are $0.34 to $0.36 cents per share and we believe the $200 million in savings from restructuring that will realize in 2009 will increase operational profits and margin, positioning us well to deliver double-digit earnings growth in 2009.  We'll share more detail with you about 2009 expectations at our investor conference next month.  ", "So if you'll turn to the last slide, we can't reiterate enough that our annuity-based business is a true asset in tough economic times.  It delivers recurring revenue through multi-year contracts and generates strong operating cash flow.   As Larry mentioned, we expect to have another strong year in cash from operations.  ", "(Inaudible) of boosting our post-sale is increasing install activity of Xerox products.  Our investments in the SMB channels through coverage and a broad portfolio of service and technology are paying off and helping to offset the challenges we're facing in large enterprises.  ", "That's why with the strong growth from developing markets, revenue has remained stable this year.  We're managing the balance sheet with a close eye on the bottom line.  The restructuring action this year positioned us well for 2009, reducing our cost base and giving us greater flexibility in our model to operate even more efficiently and effectively in any economic environment.", "Well, let me end where I started.  We remain confident in the strength of our financial position need our ability to manage the business successfully through today's challenges, and for the long-term value of our shareholders.", "So thank you again for joining us today.  Now Larry, Ursula and I will open the line to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)  And our first question comes from the line of Carol Sabbagha with Barclay's Capital.  You may proceed.", "Caroline Sabbagha - Barclay's Capital", "Thank you very much.  Just a couple of questions, Anne.  First, on '09 guidance, not going into great detail because I'm sure you're going to give that in November, but sort of when you look out is it just the restructuring that's giving you confidence and say you can achieve double-digit growth.  ", "Second, what are you assuming sort of the economic backdrop is for '09 in that forecast?  Third, how much of the $200 million in savings from the restructuring would you expect to drop to the bottom line, and what is your thought process around FX going into that year?", "Anne Mulcahy", "So I would start, Carol, by saying we're certainly not depending on any economic recovery in 2009 to guide us in terms of our ability to deliver earnings growth.  We are assuming more of the same if not quite frankly some hedge on a deterioration in economic environment.  Clearly we have some opportunities based upon the strength of the product portfolio and another strong year of product introductions and the momentum we have in services.  ", "But the reality is we intend to take the full $200 million in savings to the bottom line plus.  So this really is an opportunity to insure, despite very, very tough economic circumstances where expecting continued pressure as it relates to currency in 2009.  And that's really why we're being so aggressive in terms of the cost reductions so that we can be assured of delivering the earnings growth that we would expect in 2009.  ", "Carol Sabbagha - Barclay's Capital", "Okay.  And one other question.  You did buy back some stock this quarter.  Just looking out over the next 12 months, given the credit environment we're in, what is sort of your approach going to be to stock buybacks?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think obviously we had indicated to you that we'd slowed down the buybacks.  That was  really due to the litigation settlement in the second half of this year.  And I think we'll continue to monitor and be conservative as we go into 2009.  ", "Obviously we look at a very low stock price that is an opportunity but we're going to be cautious and ensure that like always we're conservative with our uses of cash and to the extent that it makes sense to repurchase we will.", "Carol Sabbagha - Barclay's Capital", "Thank you very much.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Thanks, Carol.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.  You may proceed. ", "Richard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup", "Oh, great.  Thank you very much.  Anne, I was a little surprised to hear you say that Europe is relatively stable.  I was wondering if you could provide any more detail there, and specifically do you think that any of the strength that you're seeing in Europe is due to pent-up demand coming out of Drupa that may not last here as we go into Q4 in the first half of '09?  Thank you.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yeah, thanks.  Our comment on Europe stability was specifically with regard to Q3.  I think we have started to see weakening, certainly in the UK and clearly are not anticipating continued stability in Europe.  So we have comprehended a weakening environment.  ", "By the way, currency plays a big role in that because as you look at both the euro and the yen it has a significant impact.  So we've built in, quite frankly, a fairly I think realistic outlook of what we can expect from Europe next year.   And it's certainly not reflective of the stability that we saw in Q3.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Okay.  And then one follow-up if I could.  I was hoping you might be able to help us figure out how to think about the impact of recent currency movements on your margins and what type of remediation actions you can take and how quickly to maintain margins in the face of adverse currency movements here.  Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay.  I think I'm going to start and maybe Larry will want to jump in here but as we look at the euro the impact on revenue if we looked at, for example, today's spot rates on what we expect for Q4 is about a 5% negative impact on revenue for Q4.  Obviously it has some positive implications as it relates to cost as well, and we comprehend those then as we look at the outlook.  ", "But there is clearly a negative with regard to the impact of the euro on our revenue flow-through.  But we are always live in the world of constant currency and we'll continue to report that way so you'll always get a sense from the underlying strength of the activity.  ", "Probably the bigger issue for us is the dramatic turn in the yen.  And as we look at the yen, I mean, we hedge the balance sheet in terms of activity that we can currently identify, if you will, in the pipeline.  But going forward on forward purchases, it's really impossible to kind of hedge that activity.  So if I look at, for example Q3 we lost probably about $20 million.  ", "So I think that was an unexpected impact on our earnings.  If we looked at the biggest single disappointment that we didn't anticipate in Q3 it was really the impact on the cost base which obviously got reflected in gross margin for Q3.  We're expecting that going forward to continue, so when you ask about we'll do what we can on the hedging side, but it is not sufficient to offset the impact, so our plan is to restructure.  ", "And that we're going to live in the real world; we're going to comprehend the flow-through of that and we are going to actually restructure our cost base so that the kind of continuing negative pressures that we've seen continue and we can still improve our results to deliver double-digit earnings.  ", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Okay.  And would you be willing to give us some sense of the impact of recent yen movements on gross margins for the fourth quarter and then I'll see you at the floor.  Thank you.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Okay.  I mean, I think what we saw in the third quarter was probably two or three tenths of gross margin impact.  You know, that was in the third quarter.  That will accelerate going forward.  Probably two or three times that when we look at, quite frankly, the yen impact as it relates to the total cost base that -- now obviously all of our competitors are in the same place as well, so this is not something that disadvantages us; we all kind of get our supply from Asia.  ", "So this is kind of a level playing ground, but having said that we definitely expect it to get worse going forward and that's why we really have quite frankly done the due diligence on what kind of cost-base restructuring needs to happen so that we can offset that and more to deliver better bottom-line earnings.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Thanks very much.  To follow up on that last question, how are competitors responding to the weaker environment?  Have you seen any change in the pricing environment in both the production and the office side?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I mean, I think we would say that pricing has somewhat stabilized and it actually has improve a little bit from what we were seeing so we're giving you a 5% to 10% range on kind of price discounting that is pretty consistent for us.  So we had seen a little bit of a spike earlier in the year that has moderated.  ", "So pricing itself is not a significant additional pressure, if you will.  I think what we're seeing from competitors is competitors taking prices up, particularly supplies pricing.  We've seen almost all of our competitors take supply pricing up.  Obviously we are doing that opportunistically as well. ", "I think we're just starting to see that happen, so I mean, we are obviously intending to stay competitive and make sure that we win in the marketplace.  But I think we're seeing more, quite frankly, uplift in price, particularly on the post-sale side than we've seen in quite a while.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Anne, last cycle was characterized, particularly in the production segment, with excess capacity amongst the commercial printers.  What's your sense in terms of the amount of capacity out there.  Do you expect to see a capacity overhang in that commercial printing segment as we roll forward here given the weakness in pages?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I think, I mean, I think we would characterize it that there is probably -- I'm not sure if I'd call it excess capacity in black and white, but sufficient capacity without having to reinvest, if you will, in new technology where we see the opportunity for growth is in digital and color.  ", "And that's where all the growth is happening in the commercial print marketplace.  Obviously the excess capacity is in the analog world in the offset world, and that is a big problem.  And I think that we find that the commercial print world is prioritizing their investments for growth.  So we're seeing color, number one on the list.  And then digital in general being the only place investments being made in the commercial print marketplace.", "So you're right; we're seeing some pressure on pages but I do think that those who want to survive and grow in this particular economy are going to have to get into the value-based part of the market, which is all about color digital printing.  So we're optimistic that that actually will come back favorably in terms of the graphic communications marketplace.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank ", "Okay.  Last question around strength in DMO and SMB.  How sustainable is the strength in those segments, given the global economy?  What gives you confidence that SMB in particular won't soften going forward?  Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, for us global imaging is a great barometer for SMB growth and quite frankly they have been extraordinarily resilient in terms of the ability to deliver great results.  And so that's been a great kind of bell weather for us that their ability to perform in what we would view as a weak economy all this year, is fabulous.", "I think we are clearly moderating our expectations for DMO.  That's already comprehended in our outlooks.   Both from a currency perspective as well as some potential weakening of the DMO economy and I would characterize that as saying still growing, but perhaps not at the rate of growth that we've seen, which has been extraordinary, obviously, over the last few years.  ", "I mean, one of the reasons we invested in SMB is because we have such a low share there.  So from our expectation we have more to gain than we have to lose as we go after the SMB.  Those that are obviously very heavily vested already, particularly in the black and white side of the SMB marketplace have  a lot to lose.  We have relatively nothing there so we tend to benefit from the upside there versus, quite frankly, the downside risk.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JP Morgan.  You may proceed.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Yes, thank you.  Good morning.   A couple questions, if I could, just following up on Chris's question.  With the SMB market and the vulnerability of that segment to macro duress and tightening credit, are you trying to flex your financing arm a little bit to help out those folks?  Or are you kind of status quo right now?", "Anne Mulcahy", "You know, we really don't do a lot of financing in the SMB market.  most of our financing takes place in the large enterprise area and what we do offer, which is very attractive to the SMB market is leasing, operating leases, which allows them to invest in the technology without having to do a capital outlay.  So it's one of the reasons that it puts pressure on equipment sale margins for us but we think it's a really great offering in tough economic times to have operating leases.  ", "So it basically extends the ability to acquire the technology without taking, quite frankly, the balance sheet risk as it relates to the capital investments.  And so far so good; we're seeing that really as an attractive option for the SMB market.", "Lawrence Zimmerman ", "Just so we're clear, too, we're not taking additional credit risk.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay.", "Lawrence Zimmerman ", "If you were asking that.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "That was going to be my second point.  If you were flexible to taking on extra risks to maybe inspire greater demand generation with the SMB segment.", "Lawrence Zimmerman ", "No.", "", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay.  And then as far as global imaging, any change in the margin structure?  I know it's been a pretty attractive margin profile for you.  Has there been any change in that structure in this type of environment?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, we've seen margin improve because they're selling more Xerox products and that give us, quite frankly, the manufacturing flow-through on that.  So nothing but good news from global imaging.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay.  And then just lastly, maybe bigger picturing.  Anne, can you maybe just kind of give us some context around what you're seeing from your large customers this time versus the '01-'02 downturn?  Are they doing anything differently?  Are they slamming the brakes on some projects, all projects?  What kind of sense do you get from your major customers?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yeah, I think we do see a big difference.  I think we see both time to revenue, time to contract, all -- so I guess I'd kind of put the anxiety factor around the large enterprise business that feels a lot stronger right now than previously.  ", "So that it's not as much that we have seen a downsizing of activity.  It's a lack of new activity coming out of commercial enterprise -- the big enterprises than we've seen historically in the past. ", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay.  So there hasn't been a major deferrals, then, just a lack of new generation then?", "Anne Mulcahy", "Yeah.  I think it's just -- and by the way, that's where fortunately our Services business has been well-positioned.  I think we're looking at, we're doing big services contracts with financial services and weaker parts of the industry so that they can reduce the cost of their infrastructure.  So this is where the services business is really well-positioned in terms of the economic downturn.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.  You may proceed.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Hi, good morning.  ", "Anne Mulcahy", "Hi, good morning, Shannon.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Just a question in terms of sort of market share and competitive positioning, what you're seeing out there.  I mean, it seems as if this is more of the market issue as opposed to Xerox losing share.  But I'm just kind of curious as to what you're seeing.  And then sort of how we should think about some of the consolidation that's gone on in the industry with for example the Ricoh purchase of Icon.  Thanks.", "Anne Mulcahy", "Well, I'll begin and then maybe Ursula can talk a little bit about the implications of the Icon/Ricoh purchase.  But there is no question that I think we're faring well in terms of the market indicators.  For example, although it's a little bit of a lagging indicator, market share literally -- I mean we regained our color revenue leadership.  ", "We are number one in revenue leadership across the board, all segments.  We gained share in every segment except one which was production color and that's really where the 700 and the iGen4 are going to have a dramatic impact.  ", "Our installs as we look at just install increases in the quarter, we are up across the board with the exception of mono production which quite frankly isn't really a lot different in terms of what we are reporting from the past, so every market indicator would say that we are holding our own and potentially will gain share in tough times which for us is the strategy because that's the annuity of the future.  Ursula, the Icon Rico piece?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We expect, it hasn't closed yet, but we expect as it closes for this to go fairly well, the Icon and Rico management business going forward, but we are prepared to take advantage of any fallout that happens there for sure in a delayed or confused buying decision by their customers.  ", "More importantly though I think the biggest impact that combination will have will be on Canon.  It is clearly an advantage for Xerox Corporation so if you look at Canon's business, Global Imaging and now Icon Rico has tightened up Canon's go to market abilities pretty significantly.  We do not think it will be a negative for Xerox.", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "As a matter of fact, I might add that we are actually seeing winds in Canon's installs population due to the fact that those all become decisionable now with this particular Icon Canon installation so we are a little bit bullish about this.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay great, and Larry can you talk a bit about cash flow?  Obviously it's so important in the fourth quarter, given all of the -- everything that's going on, can you just sort of walk us through the biggest drivers of cash flow in fourth quarter and what we should keep in mind and how -- what leaves you at your comfort level with this sort of billion dollars approximately you're going to be expecting?", " ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well I think if you look at what we've consistently done in the fourth quarter, working capital has dramatic changes in fourth quarter so inventory and accounts receivable improve significantly and I am confident that we will do that again.  We also have our highest earnings of the year so the combination of that and improvements in working capital makes me confident that will happen in the future.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay and then one last question, with regard to the debt that will be coming due in the first quarter, how do we think about the interest cost on that debt relative to ways that you are going to be able to move it to the credit facility or whatever?  Should that be a net positive?  How should we sort of think about it from an interest cost standpoint?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well right now I would say that you ought to consider sort of a neutral point of view because you don't know what the market rates are but if you think of us using cash flow which will build up cash on hand in the fourth quarter, if you think of the revolver which has lower rates, I mean you could build a case here where we are going to save money because those are at 9.75 so assuming you don't go to capital markets and not crazy, I think with cash on hand and revolver, we certainly have more than adequate funds and it will be a lower rate.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah, with Bank of America.  You may proceed.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America ", "", "Hi guys.  Thanks for taking the questions.  Anne, can you at least anecdotally maybe give us a sense for if you hadn't done the restructuring with the two $200 million cost savings, what might we have expected from baseline APEX in '09?  ", "And I guess the reason I'm asking is because '07 and '08 you grew out back to maybe mid single digits, '08 today which is a bit higher than you traditionally have and you had some things going on the last couple of years in terms of product build out, distribution build out, things of that nature, that we might have expected to kind of taper off a little bit in '09, which might offset the '09 baseline APEX spend.", "I don't have a package of traditional levels but maybe a little bit lower on year regrowth level than they were the last couple of years, then you have the $200 million on top of that so I guess I just wanted to see if you could maybe give us a sense of where we might actually have seen things above and beyond the $200 million cost savings?  ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well I think, I mean it's a really hard question to answer because I mean there are so many variables that we are dealing with right now.  I would look at it and say if we hadn't quite frankly run into the tough economy, if we hadn't run into the currency impacts of quite frankly to the cost base particularly, then clearly there was little or no need to take a $400 million restructuring.  ", "Having said that, we are always working the issues and we would have taken these over time anyway.  These are all when optimization of technology enabled productivity, remote diagnostics, all sorts of opportunities for us to quite frankly be more efficient and more productive, which we have tried to take over time and comprehend within our earnings.  ", "I think the whole reason for accelerating this and doing it in the fourth quarter is prepare for the fact that we do believe that 2009 will be a very tough year from an economy perspective, from a currency perspective, and we want to set expectations for earnings growth that we can count on quite frankly restructuring to deliver.  It certainly gets our business more fixed, which is not a bad thing, and should conditions turn better, I think it's all upside for us.  ", "I mean, one of the things that clearly haven't yielded in total yet is we have been making coverage investments and we've stayed the course on our marketing and coverage investments because we know we have got the portfolio and the capability to deliver more with coverage and clearly that is a little dampened in a weakened economy and that investment is staged to deliver as the economy turns as well, so I guess that doesn't really answer your question but it's probably as good as we can do.

Just wondering what your thoughts are around  your graphic arts business, I guess your mom and pop commercial business, because at their heart, many of those folks are actually small/medium businesses.", "And we continue to hear from other large companies their concerns about the small/medium business, either customers or distributors getting access to financing and things like that, so can you just give us, I guess let us know what you are seeing there and what your thinking is around those folks and how concerned you are, if you are concerned about them getting financing?  ", "Anne M. Mulcahy", "Well, let me begin by saying I think we are trying to enable the graphic arts industry with operating leases so this really, once again, has an impact on equipment sale revenue but it enables quite frankly our graphic arts customers do what they have to do to be successful which is bring in digital technology and get into the value based kind of printing business without us taking the balance sheet risk quite frankly on capital investment on their part so we think that is a good strategy.  ", "Having said that, there is no question that we see some weakness, more so in pages I would say than just installs and our production color installs grew 4% in the quarter which certainly isn't at the rate that we've had in the past but it grew.

Mulcahy", "Twenty-seven percent so I do think that we are optimizing the graphic arts industry by helping the healthy graphic arts players have access to digital technology by ensuring that quite frankly these operating leases enable that and making sure that they are well positioned to deliver the value based printing capabilities that will be absolutely crucial to their survival and success going forward.", "Ananda Baruah - Bank of America ", "Thanks and then I guess just this last one for me, clearly you guys are pointing to sort of the numbers varied out, I guess production being the most significant area of weakness this quarter and it's production enterprise, I guess you had sort of the iGen4 and the 700 color press for only a few weeks this quarter in North America.", "It sounds like you guys feel relatively comfortable with the shipment trends you saw kind of the first couple of weeks from those guys, so where was the relative areas of weakness compared to what you guys were expecting in production for both mono and color, was it really more on the mono side that you guys were surprised a little bit?  ", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think Anne said in her talk earlier that the activity decline that we saw, the biggest weakness was clearly in production mono.  We did have the 700 and the iGen4 for a couple of weeks only, particularly in North America, iGen4 worldwide only for a couple of weeks, 700 in a couple of weeks, the shipment trends are very, very strong so I believe that we will continue to actually perform well in the color production side and we will continue to see weakness in production mono.", "Anne M.

Zimmerman", "By a wide margin.", "Keith Bachmann - BMO Capital Markets", "Sorry I understand that, what I'm trying to ask is if you think about what you have due versus what you anticipate in cash flow, should we think about the share buy back, keeping what levels of share buy back should we anticipate next year?

One is on the office margins, I mean they are strong because everything was strong, activity was strong, clearly it was by the way probably the most lucrative area for us is color multifunction.

We have got it broken out pretty well in terms of area of the business and I might add personally just to spend a minute talking about it.", "I would say that some of the development in engineering optimization that we have will probably have a bigger impact on production than office just because we do that in house so some of the manufacturing optimization and the development optimization will have a disproportionately positive impact on production.", "But there is going to be enough of a general infrastructure that it's going to be pretty significant for office, too, so Ursula, I think it's important to kind of characterize some of the things that we are doing because I think that they are pretty well thought out and they really position us well for the future.

Zimmerman \u2013 Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President", "Ursula M. Burns \u2013 President, Director", "Analysts", "Richard Gardner \u2013 Citigroup", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Chris Whitmore \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "Operator", "Welcome to the Xerox Corporation second quarter 2009 earnings conference call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chief Executive Officer.  She is joined by Larry Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer.  During this call Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the Web at www.xerox.com/investor.  At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded.  Other recording and/or re-broadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.", "After the presentation, there will be a question and answer session.  (Operator Instructions)  During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain.  Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I will turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns.", "Ursula M. Burns", "As many of you know, I took over the CEO role at Xerox on July 1.  With 29 years of Xerox tenure under my belt and the great benefit of working side-by-side with Anne Mulcahy, I am both humbled by the trust the board has placed in me and honored by the opportunity to lead our company now and well into the future.  We made progress in the second quarter managing through the challenges of the global recession by focusing intently on cash and earnings while investing for growth.", "Please turn to slide four and we'll get started.  We delivered $0.16 earnings per share, $609 million in operating cash flow, and a one point increase in gross margin.  All of this reflects the strong flow-through of our cost reduction initiatives and operational improvements.  At the same time, our industry continues to face challenges from the decline in enterprise spending on technology.  This is delaying purchasing decisions and slowing demand for document related supplies and support.", "Xerox has seen sequential improvement with revenue up 5% from the first quarter of this year.  And our clients are increasingly responding to the up to 30% savings we provide through our managed print services.  We believe it is imperative that we continue to innovate and build market place momentum for when the economy starts to improve.  That's why we're continuing our steady drumbeat of product launches, 12 through the first half of this year including the Xerox ColorQube that cuts the cost of printing a color page by up to 62%.", "Let me take a moment to review our Q2 results.  Larry will then share more detail about our financials, I'll provide some guidance for next quarter then Larry and I will take your questions.  So please turn to slide five for a summary of our second quarter performance.  Sixteen cents EPS is above our $0.10 to $0.12 expectations for the quarter.  This is the result of significant efficiencies captured in the business and a disciplined approach to cost and expense management necessary to help offset the economic impact on revenue.", "The recession is affecting our business in three key areas.  First, the overall slowdown in business activity has lowered demand for supplies, especially in heavily document servicing processes like financing applications, mortgages, insurance enrollments, M&A and hiring and training, all areas where Xerox's technology and services are critical and areas we are confident there will be an improvement as the economy rebounds.", "Second, we are closely managing costs and our customers are doing the same, which means delaying spending on technology until there are stronger signs of economic improvements.  And while sales cycles are longer and deals are smaller, our customers are taking advantage of the value we offer with outsourcing and other document services.", "Third, the especially hard hit developing markets dampen our total revenue picture.  In areas like Russia and Eurasia access to credit is still quite limited and is creating a huge burden on the business environment.  These factors contributed to a second quarter revenue decline of 18% including a five point negative impact from currencies.  ", "Wholesale revenue was down 8% in the constant currency and equipment sale revenue declined 25%.  Total revenue was $3.7 billion, which was $177 million higher than the first quarter that's an increase of 5%.  Again, the flow-through from restructuring and operational improvements are helping to relieve pressure from the revenue declines.  ", "Gross margins improved one point from last year to 40.2% and it's up sequentially by 1.3 points.  Selling, administrative and general expenses were down year-over-year by $157 million.  Second quarter operating cash flow of $609 million was $167 million higher than Q2 '08.  This performance positions us well to increase our guidance for full year cash flow to $1.5 billion from $1.3 billion.", "Our cash on hand was up $672 million in Q2 and we closed the quarter with a cash balance of $1.2 billion.  Total debt is down $347 million through the first half of the year.  We continue to remain on track to reduce overall debt by $1 billion this year.", "Let's turn to slide six.  This slide reflects the recessionary factors that are impacting our industry and our business and where our competitive position is holding up well.  As I mentioned, we saw some modest improvements in Q1 with revenue up 5%.", "In today's time, sequential trends tend to be more meaningful than year-over-year ones.  We're closely monitoring them so that our investments are well aligned with signs of economic recovery.  Equally important, our install base or what we MIF, machines in field, remains stable.  That means that clients aren't exiting technology contracts.  In fact, our digital install base is up 2%.", "And I've touched on services a couple of times, the decision making for services deals have lengthened and we are seeing an increase in smaller deals.  But the value of our offerings in this area really can't be overstated.  It's a competitive differentiator that is quite resilient and is opening up more deals for us than ever before.", "We absolutely lead the industry in managed print services and document outsourcing.  Our more than 50% win rate against competitors is helping us strengthen this leadership.  Gartner ranks Xerox in the top of its magic quadrant for print services.  We just secured the document outsourcing top ranking in the Black Book of Outsourcing.", "Others in the industry are clearly intrigued by the 30% savings that Xerox can offer and now they're making claims similar to that.  But we're confident that we are the only company with the vast experience and expertise to deliver savings with no strings attached.", "I noted earlier the economic impact on our business in developing markets.  You'll see here that it resulted in a 34% decline in revenue for Q2.  I was in Russia earlier this month and while conversations with business and government leaders alluded to some returning confidence, it will be a longer road to recovery, especially for the small and mid-sized businesses that are dependent on access to credit.", "Our brand remains very strong in these regions and we we'll continue to maintain our broad distribution capacity so we maintain and grow our market share.  In our office business we continue to see the direct impact of lower channel inventory and supply sales.  But our market share is holding up.  ", "For example, installs were up 10% in segments [two to five].  Operating margin of 10.8% was stable from last year and up four points from Q1.  We continue to have the industry's broadest portfolio of technologies of businesses of any size and we intend to maintain this leadership position.  That's why we launched eight competitively priced office systems in Q2. ", "Of note is the Xerox ColorQube, which is first A3 solid ink multi-function system.  A proprietary solid ink enables a huge breakthrough in the cost of color printing.  As I mentioned earlier, with ColorQube the cost of a color page can be cut by up to [$0.62].  The ColorQube buzz has caught on and created demand.  We are pleased with the pace of installs and will open more markets faster than initially planned to broaden availability.", "The decline in transactional business activity that I touched on earlier can be seen in our production business, which is impacted by lower black and white page volume and product mix.  That being said, demand for iGen4 remains strong as the commercial print industry invests in digital.  Xerox's iGen system is the industry standard.", "The sequential operating margin increase in production is good, but it's not good enough.  Certainly the economy has had a major impact on this business with declines in mono offsetting color gains.  But frankly with an operating margin of 4.7%, we see this as an area of improvement going forward.", "We'll continue to build on our strong leadership in this space.  In fact, at the upcoming Print '09 show we'll highlight a broad array of printing applications, technology, unique packaging and finishing systems.  You'll see that our innovation stays ahead of the pace making it harder for others to catch up.", "Revenue from color, while down in Q2, still represents more than 40% of our total revenue.  [Getting] it out we know the economic factors that are impacting our business, we're executing well in all areas where we can mitigate these factors and we're maintaining our focus on innovation, services, distribution and brand strength that will benefit us when the economy improves.", "That's a good time and a good place for me to hand it over to Larry for more details on our financial results.", "Lawrence R. Zimmerman", "", "At the first quarter earnings call we discussed the challenges of the current environment, as well as the difficulty in projecting the future results.  We said we would assume no change on our revenue trend.  We would focus on areas we could control, cost and expense, cash, and strive for sequential improvement across the board.  We targeted ourselves to achieve more total revenue in second quarter than first.  We delivered $177 million more.  We targeted ourselves to lower our cost and improve gross profit margin.", "We delivered 40.2 versus 38.9 in Q1 and up a point from last year.  We targeted significant expense reductions.  We delivered $224 million year-over-year in second quarter, $171 million of constant currency versus $109 million in Q1.  We targeted ourselves to deliver at least $0.10 to $0.12 of earnings per share.  We delivered $0.16 of earnings per share.  We targeted ourselves to generate at least $300 million of cash flow from ops.  We delivered $609 million.  These results demonstrate the strength of our business model.  ", "Slide eight.  We continue to aggressively drive for revenue in all parts of our business while recognizing the economic realities.  Although demand is lower and decisions are delayed, our product line and services are as broad and competitive as they have ever been and we continue to win in the marketplace.  Our focus on cost and expense reductions is yielding.", "Our gross profit margin was 40.2%, an increase from Q1 and last year.  Cost reductions, coupled with mix, more than offset the impact of a stronger Yen.  RD&E and SAG expense, excluding bad debts, declined $224 million with $53 million held from currency.  Again, our focus on restructuring and discretionary reductions is yielding.  Bad debt increased $46 million from last year, but is basically consistent with Q1 at about 1% of our finance receivables.  Going forward we are assuming it will stay at this level.  ", "Operating income was 7.6% up from 5% in Q1, as we delivered additional revenue and reduced cost and expense.  Equity income was $9 million, which reflects the business environment pressures on our partner Fuji Xerox down $21 million year-over-year.  And, finally, our EPS was $0.16 a share.  ", "Slide nine.  Cash flow has and will continue to be the strength of our annuity based business model.  Our people executed well on all fronts in the quarter.  We delivered earnings of $147 million, reduced inventory and accounts receivable by $325 million, reduced year-to-date debt $347 million projected to be down $1 billion full year, held CapEx and internal use software at $39 million, delivered $609 million of cash flow from ops, demonstrated access and capacity demand in capital markets with a $750 million bond transaction in May, enhanced our flexibility with $1.8 billion unused revolver capacity, and ended the quarter with $1.2 billion of cash.", "Based on these results, I believe we can deliver about $1.5 billion of cash flow from ops for the year or $1.45 free cash flow per share.  ", "Slide ten.  Let's quickly touch on currency and bad debts and then move on to our financing business.  Translation currency, converting of non-U.S. P&L to U.S. dollars has improved slightly and compares will approve in fourth quarter assuming spot rates remain the same.  Transaction currency converting costs, mostly yen, to a country's currency, for example, U.S. dollars or euros, we also have seen some improvement but the yen is still significantly stronger than last year, which pressures us on cost.  ", "In 2Q we were able to mitigate this with other cost reductions resulting in a 40.2 gross profit margin.  Bad debts, although they increased in this economic environment, they remained a relatively small percentage of our receivables below 1%.  We expect this trend to continue going forward this year.", "The bottom part of the slide addresses our financing dynamics to give a perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining investment grade status.  We lease finance the majority of our products to our customers in a three to five-year bundle total contract that generally includes the equipment, service supplies and leasing and financing.", "The equipment represents $7.6 billion of finance assets and we leveraged them, seven-to-one.  That's the $6.6 billion of debt on the slide.  The remaining $1.4 billion is core debt only 18% leverage.  Over the three to five years our customers paid down this obligation to Xerox.  This is a committed stream of cash.  The debt ladder shows how we manage the debt maturities and balance with operating cash flow.", "We keep these maturities at approximately $1 billion a year, contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years, which has been $1.5 billion to $2 billion and forecasted to be $1.5 billion this year even in the current environment.  As the debt matures, we have typically gone to capital markets to maintain the leverage ratio.  In May we borrowed $750 million in difficult times.", "In addition, we have a $2 billion revolver that gives us flexibility as to when we want to go to capital markets.  So the context and perspective I'm giving you on this is the majority of our debt supports contractually obligated payments from our customers.  Our core debt is small.  Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong, and we have comfortably managed this over the years and will continue to do so.", "Slide 11.  The last topic I would like to cover before turning it back to Ursula is our second quarter post-sale revenue dynamics.  Although certainly impacted by the economy, post-sale has held up relatively well with an 8.4% constant currency decline.  Over 60% of the decline, 5.4 of the 8.4 points was driven by paper and supplies.  Both of these revenue streams continue to be impacted by weaker end user demand and inventory management by out distributors, as well as end users.", "Developing markets with its two tier distribution has been disproportionately impacted by the economic slowdown resulting in a 25% decrease in post-sale revenue, which represents 3.3 points of the 8.4.  Their performance is magnified by currency changes in those geographies for which we do not adjust but which cost us about two percentage points on total post-sale revenue.", "We are seeing less of an impact on usage levels of our equipment, which affects our core annuity of outsourcing service and rental, only $90 million lower on a base of $2 billion or 2.6 points of the 8.4.  Our machines in the field continue to grow 23% for color and 2% for total digital.  This is another positive sign going forward as our install base is large and growing.  Although pages were down driven by mono production declines, colored pages grew 12%.", "So in summary, obviously, difficult times where we focus on what we can control, drive as much revenue as possible, up minded in reducing costs and expenses, drive the strength of our model, cash and of course, deliver value to our shareholders.  I think we accomplished all of these in 2Q and this resolve will continue going forward.  ", "Thank you and now back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Here's a closing summary of the quarter.  We are pleased with EPS, cash flow, gross margin and operational improvements that delivered solid bottom line results despite continued revenue challenges.  These results reflect the strength of our model and the resolve of our people.", "So our Q2 performance positions us well to deliver full year guidance.  Third quarter is seasonally our slowest on revenue.  So Q3 requires continued discipline in cost and expense management and prioritizing cash.  Building marketplace momentum also remains a priority and we'll maintain our focus on value-based offerings like managed free services and document outsourcing.", "This, along with the breadth of our technology, expanded distribution, and global account management gives us confidence in the strength of our long-term competitive position.  With that, we're setting third quarter guidance at $0.10 to $0.12.  We continue to expect full year 2009 earnings to be in the range of $0.50 to $0.55.  ", "Thank you for your time.  Now, Larry and I will be happy to take your questions.  ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from Richard Gardner - Citigroup.  ", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Larry and Ursula, aside from a seasonal revenue decline in Q3, could you walk us through the dynamics that are prompting you to guide earnings down sequentially?  ", "Ursula M. Burns", "It's primarily, the seasonality of our business revenue and gross profit are weaker in the third quarter.  One issue, we've also over delivered on the cost and expense savings in Q2.  We do expect to deliver a strong cost and expense savings in Q3.  We do start to lap some of the benefits that we did in quarter two of last year as well.  So weaker revenues sequentially, weaker profits sequentially, little bit of negative headwind from currency, and cost and expense savings still being pushed, I think, get us to the point where we're at 10 to 12.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "It sounds like you're expecting gross margins down sequentially, and I'm wondering why that would be the case given probably continued yield from negotiations with Fuji Xerox, as well as a more favorable dollar yen relationship in the quarter and perhaps a full quarter benefit of that.  And then maybe if Larry could give us a little bit of a sense of how SAG should trend sequentially as well, it seems like it should be down given that you've got continued restructuring savings, as well as a seasonal decline in revenue.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I think on the gross profit margin, what you see in the third quarter is seasonally less revenue.  And when you have less revenue, particularly on the wholesale side, it tends to fall right through because you have to keep your cost level there because you go into the fourth quarter and the revenue goes up and there's a lot more work there.", "So you tend to see, that's why the margin always goes down in the third quarter because you're losing predominantly on the post-sale seasonality in the quarter and that just affects the margin.  I don't expect it to be a huge effect, but it is an affect and that does make it lower, and that really drives the answer to why earnings per share would be down in the quarter.", "On the expense side, I think there would be sequential improvement.  It wouldn't be a huge number but you also have the currency less from a spot rate standpoint right now in the compares year-to-year, so that would take the expense back up.  And so I guess we're assuming that you wouldn't see a huge sequential decline there, it would be moderate.  And I think the combination of that gets you to the earnings per share that we are expecting in the quarter.", "Ursula M. Burns", "As far as the Fuji Xerox cost savings flow-through, we've been successful in negotiating some good cost reductions from Fuji Xerox.  We don't believe that we'll get significantly better news or additional news from Fuji Xerox going forward.  They're struggling like we're struggling and their economies are struggling like our economies are.  So we're working hard with Fuji Xerox, but not additional significant cost savings.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "And that's another point, the equity income sense that [inaudible].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research", "[Audio gap] hearing from your end customers about page volumes, demand for color, where they're printing, what they're printing.  And then also any thoughts on how they're looking at leases, pushing them out a year and just sort of in general what your customers are saying.", "Ursula M. Burns", " ", "Good question on page volumes, color, mixes, business, etc.  Most of the impact that we're seeing on page volumes is in production mono, significant impact in production mono.  It's a transactional business, the economy is hitting right in the middle of that segment, right in the heartland of that segment, so M&A things, legal business, training, employee onboard, and all of those types of activities which serve the production mono business well are down in this economic time.", "The good news about the business, the install base is there, the people still have the machines.  When the economy starts to turn up, we do expect \u2013 when it starts to rebound we do expect that our technology will be used more and more.", "Office, on the other hand, is a position of strength for us.  I said in the talk that we grew our position in segment two to five, our position in colors, in office stays strong, so color in the office and black and white new office is good, biggest hit in mono.  Page volumes overall, monochrome down, color down significantly less so holding up very well across the board, both in office and in production.", "Leases pushing them out, we do see technology refresh on a longer cycle, so people are holding onto their technology for a longer amount of time.  On the positive side, they are not canceling their contracts, though, they are holding that equipment.  We do think that when business volumes start to rebound that we will see customers being more open and more capable of upgrading their technologies.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Larry, could you talk a little bit about how we should think about working capital and the various different parts of the balance sheet as we go through the next couple of quarters?  I know you've guided full year you took up the cash flow number, but just in terms of the out-performance this quarter and then sort of how to think about next and then fourth quarter.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well, we tried to push second quarter and I think we succeeded.  We tried to make it like a fourth quarter so that we had a much better performance in working capital, inventory and AR.  And so I think you're going to see less of a skew where it all happens in the fourth quarter.  Again, third quarter is seasonally weaker so you won't see nearly the performance [audio gap].  The fourth quarter will be well done, but it's kind of a smoothing effect which we're really trying for, for the long term.  We'd like to actually do this trick more than in 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ben Reitzes - Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "I've got two questions, one is on cash flow.  You upped the forecast and it's $200 million which is a nice pop, but is anything happening to change your view of how you want to use the cash, in terms of when you think you can do share repurchases or acquisitions and how you're thinking about that into 2010 and 2011 even with the head start you got?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "Well, I think, Ben, we stay where we are in this environment on what we're doing with cash.  Right now we're paying down debt.  We have debts [audio gap] third and fourth quarter going forward here that we going to pay down.  We want to have a good cash balance [audio gap] and I think then we would evaluate if we change direction, if the economy got a lot better.  If the economy stays where it is, I think [audio gap].", "I think on the acquisition side, we have done small distribution ones.  We're still looking at those, but they would be on the small side [audio gap] and we'll re-evaluate.", "Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "So in short, it sounds like next year you re-evaluate if things remain stable on that share repurchase question.  And then with regard to post-sale, can you just talk some of the trends there in more detail?  What's going on with supplies, is supplies inventory correction over, is it not over, and how long will it last, and maybe any other puts and takes of post-sale trends into the back half of the year?", "Ursula M. Burns", "What we've seen on supplies is no significant change from what we saw in the first quarter. Stabilization in North America and in Europe, continued weakness in DMO and in our XIP business, our XIP business, so not a significant change there at all.", "How long will it last is an interesting question.  I don't really know.  We're preparing for not a significant change for the remainder of this year for sure.  We're preparing for supplies inventory to be under pressure and for the post-sales to be under pressure in total.  I don't really know when it will change.", "Benjamin Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Is there a way to quantify what the hit was?  You did a 40 plus gross margin.  Is there like a supplies hit with, was there a channel inventory reduction that was a hit to the gross margin, though, in the quarter and that may be resolved even in a depressed market?  Is there any way to talk about that?", "Ursula M. Burns ", "There really wasn't, Ben, not that we could see a big difference there, not a big driver there.  If you look at what Larry was speaking about in his discussion about how our post-sales slowed, we had an 8% decline in post-sales, but if you look at our core [new] business, the decline was about 4%.  ", "So the rest of the decline is from this inventory stocking and from our two tier business model BMO, XIP etc., the core business annuity faired significantly better than the rest of the annuity stream and the rest of the business.  And if you look at that, we're counting on that level to go forward, the inventory to stay kind of where it is, they can't really destock much more than they have.  We don't expect a big rebound there, and the post-sale stream on the core piece of the business we think will rebound when the economy rebounds.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank.", "", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Another question on gross margin, this time on product gross margin and the competitive environment, curious as to what you're seeing in terms of pricing and how are your Japanese competitors responding to changing in pricing?  ", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "We've seen pricing kind of be stable in the 5% to 10% range reduction, nothing unusual in price perspective, nothing unusual with a specific competitor.  As you know, Ricoh is probably the most aggressive competitor in the market.  They stay there, they remain there and their trends have not changed.  The rest of the competitors have kept their position as well.  We've even seen some price increases in some portions of the globe, not something that we've seen everywhere by the way.  So gross margin driven by pricing, pricing not a big change across the board.", "", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Just a follow-up on that, HP recently held a call which seemed to place a bull's eye on both your production business and your office business in terms of their expected growth going forward.  What do are you seeing from HP, and maybe can you specifically address how you complete against Indigo in the high end production market.", "", "Ursula Burns", "", "What we're seeing from HP is their focus on our business, as you said, and they recently announced a managed print service offering that we've had in the market for quite a while.  We are the leader there, as I pointed out when I was speaking earlier.  So what we see in HP is trying to catch up with the position that Xerox has both in the production space, in the managed print services space, in the A3 MFP space across the board.  We don't take them lightly, we are very confident based on our investments, our history, what we're doing in the marketplace today that we can effectively compete against HP.", "", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Are they competing more with price or more with service and solutions?", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "What we're seeing in managed print services they're competing right now with words so that's right now with an advertisement so we have to see that in the marketplace.  As I said on managed print services we are very, very confident there.  In the high end space, which I didn't answer to that portion of the question before, we are very, very pleased with iGen position, the install base, the activity we got in quarter two, very strong.  We do not see them positioning, competing with us on price.  ", "As you know, they are positioned in a different place in the marketplace our AMPBs and usage patterns for our iGen 4s are higher than their Indigo devices.  But we have a breadth of portfolio that allows us to complete effectively and surround them, get right on top of them.  So we're very - it's a tough market out there, we are very confident in the position that we have in both high end color and management services and A3 Office against HP and other competitors as well. ", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "One last question from me is on the revenue guidance or expectations for revenue.  Do you think the underlying rate of year-on-year revenue growth X currency will moderate, stay about the same, or get incrementally worse in Q3?", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "We expect it to stay about the same.  We have not seen an indication for it to move in any direction, so we expect it to stay about the same.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets. ", "", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Larry, just to be clear on, and congratulations on a cash flow, Larry, on the intentions for the $1.5 you have indicated $1 billion of core debt.  If I look at the debt ladder, will you take that $1 billion down by the end of the year?  In other words, will you refi or do you think you'll just pay that off to lower your total debt outstanding at the end of the year.", "", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "", "We'll pay down our debt, two payments that are due third quarter and fourth quarter, we're going to pay them, cash flow and the cash we have on hand and end up the year down probably around  $1 billion less debt than we had.", "", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "Ursula, I wanted to ask you about two things on the revenue side.  One is the managed print services, and then second is the Solid Ink.  And I wanted to get your prospective on how we might see - you mentioned that you're being successful in leader there, HP's jumped in the market.  How might we see the benefits of that unfold in terms of the income statement?  ", "What's the magnitude of growth that you think you can get if you look at CY10, I assume that shows up on the services outsourcing and rentals line item, but perhaps you can clarify that and then I'll follow up on Solid Ink if I could.  I'll stop there and then follow up on Solid Ink.", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "You'd see the benefits in wholesale lines and where the profit revenue flows through.  What it allows us to do is \u2013 what it allows our customers to do most importantly than what it allows us to do, is to be significantly more efficient in their document infrastructure.  What we end up doing is taking a large amount of spent and output spend and consolidate that.  ", "A consolidation doesn't happen at Xerox's expense generally it happens at single function printer expense.  [Inaudible] so you'll see that by us selling more devices, also by actually more revenue streams, wholesale revenue streams from the services side of the business.", "", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "But can you give us some prospective, Ursula, on how big is the business now in terms of run rate, any kind of just color to help us think it might drive some opportunities as we look to next year?", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "About $3.5 billion on the MPS business the whole MPS businesses, large and small MPS business about $3.5 billion.  It is growing it is a stronger growth engine or being impacted less than our equipment business.  So it's an area of strength for us.  By the way, these are global businesses as well.  It's something that we practice around the globe.  I think that's what you asked as well.", "", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "And then to follow up, Ursula, on the Solid Ink, it sounds like you're definitely suggesting you're gaining some traction there, any kind of color on how you think that impacts your growth trajectory as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months?", "", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "One of the major focuses areas for Xerox, because it's the big cry from our customers, to make color more accessible to them.  They know it's important and they want to be able to use color but we can't give it to them in a cost effective manner.  Solid Ink allows us to do that.  We launched it first quarter of this year in two limited geographic.  ", "We're expanding the geographies because the call for it is more than we thought.  People want it in all areas so we're expanding how quickly we open up the rest of the United States, go to Europe in the third quarter, GIMO in 2010.  So A3 the ColorQube device we expect to be a good impetus for customers to take up color more and more.  ", "We would see the benefit of this product more in 2010, as we said when we launched in 2009 because this is all pipeline building and all teaching customers how to actually utilize this in filling the offers.  And we'll see the benefit in 2010.  We're very excited about it.  It's doing what we expect it to do.", "", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan", "", "Firstly it is encouraging to see that after a really tough first quarter that you were able to establish and get back on track in terms of normal sequential growth.  And Larry and Ursula I guess the question, as far as 3Q the weak seasonal revenue trend guidance, does that imply that you get back down to 3% to 5% sequential growth or is something a little lighter, a little worse", "And then I guess the follow up is what are the swing factors there, just given that the S&P can really be hemorrhaging here going forward if with look at the CIT fallouts or potential fallout, just the tighter credits at large, as well as the continuing problems with DMO.  What type of cross turns do you see and what types of offsets are there?", "", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman ", "", "Let me make sure I understood the revenue question.  The third quarter sequentially, obviously, is a lower revenue quarter we get the currency compares a little better so that it helps it a little though, but it's definitely a lower quarter than second quarter, and we expect to see in a constant currency way the same kind of trends that we saw in the first, second quarter.  That's where [inaudible] fourth quarter as well.", "", "On the financing, the majority of our business we finance ourselves, that was the financing section I went through there.  And it's a great go-to-market strategy, works well for our customers in bundled contracts.  We make significant [inaudible] and profit from it.  And that gives us very little exposure to anybody else having difficulty in the business, whether it's the IT, anybody else because there's very little exposure to that area.  ", "As far as DMO is concerned, we really don't do financing there.  Now, financing is affecting the business there because people are having difficulty getting financing, but that's a risky business that we have not gone into.  We counted on other sources [audio gap].", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Larry, just to get back to the seasonality's, so just to put a bracket around it, historically you have been down 3% to 5% sequentially in 3Q.  Are you saying the currency can maybe make it so it's only down 2% to 3%?  Or you still expect to be in that down 3% to 5% bracket?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "", "I think it's roughly the same.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay and then getting back to Shannon's question \u2013 ", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "", "[Inaudible] before it happens is a gift [audio gap].  ", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "Sorry, Mark, continue, sorry.", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "I'm sorry we're having a tough feed here audio wise.  I didn't mean to interrupt.  I was just curious as far as Shannon's question earlier on the renewal activity.  Those customers that are renewing, any change in terms of the overall structure.  Are you having to throw in more goodies, as far as the post-sale kind of economics in years one, two, three and four out?", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "No change from the normal trends and so let me tell you what I mean by that.  Generally when we renewed a customer, we renew at a better value proposition for the customer.  They do business with us, we learn their processes, they either upgrade technology, gives them more functionality at a better price, or they up their service engagements and we give them, we provide them with more services and we negotiate a price.  ", "We are not seeing a change for the same service or same technology when a customer wants to move to that same technology if they did that significant pressure on price in that iteration.  Generally, it's adding more value for a little bit more price or the same value for the same as to we did before.  ", "So net-net, the answer to your question is no, we're not seeing people coming to us and saying can you please renegotiate our leases or can you change the price of the contracts that we have.  When a customer is in trouble, we clearly will work with them to restructure our business, but we're not seeing that in a wholesale way.  Does that answer your question?", "Mark Moskowitz \u2013 JP Morgan", "Yes you did I appreciate it.  Just lastly Ursula or Larry, in terms of the call structure, clearly you've been really good with them as far as keeping a tight grip on cost and cost containment and takeouts, but I'm just kind of trying to get a sense in terms of when do we really expect to see SAG in particular decline at a greater rate then your revenues.  Is that going to be a crossover point in 3Q or do we have to wait until fourth quarter in terms of year-over-year revenue declines are less than the SAG declines.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "", "I think the revenue declines that you have now you can't see expense and cost going down [audio gap].  So I think our expenses have been coming down [audio gap] taking every action we know how to take [audio gap].  Fourth quarter, by the time we get to the fourth quarter if the spot rates stay the same, you get \u2013 part of the problem here is you have five or six points of currency affecting [audio gap].", "So if in constant currency if you're down 12% or 13% [inaudible] going rate, then you'll see a year-to-year or better comparison there, but try to take the structure down at the same percent as actual [audio gap].", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "If I just may add, we want to make sure that we are positioned well when the economy rebounds.  One of the reasons why it never approached the cost base to the tune of the revenue decline that we've seen last, fourth quarter, first quarter and second quarter because of that if we did that we would not be able to add the have value and be strong when the economy turns around.", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "", "And we don't expect those trends to continue 2010 don't know whether there's a recovery, but we don't expect that 18 [audio gap].", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Company.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "I guess, Larry, I just wanted to go back to the cost savings and try to get a sense for what the driver or drivers were behind what you recognized I guess this quarter.  I mean it certainly seems like you did a little more than anticipated given how you guys came out relative to the guidance.  Did you pass more through to the bottom line?  Did you do some things on a pull-forward basis from the second half of the year that you thought maybe was going to take a little bit longer to do?  Was it some combination of both?", "I guess that's the first part and, then the second part sort of related to that is what should we expect in terms of, even if it's anecdotal, in terms of pass-through to the bottom line moving forward from the cost savings?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I think cost savings, what we did when we saw this significant downturn, we got our heads together as a management team and we focused on every possible area that we could and then we committed ourselves to get that done.  Now, we did an excellent job and we delivered it in the second quarter.", "Sometimes you put together a whole cost and expense action plan and you get three-quarters of it, so these things actually, there's 55,000 people here all working on things, some of them happen, some of them don't.  I think we had very good execution in the second quarter, we delivered a lot of it, and I think we see a lot of that continuing and I think we've reflected that in our guidance that it continues.  Did we over-achieve on some of those things in the third quarter, you know, that's possible.", "", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "So you maintain the savings objective for '09 of $300 million, do you guys begin to rethink that at all?", "Lawrence A. Zimmerman", "I think right now we're executing on the restructuring savings and the other cost savings we committed to and we think they'll deliver the earnings expectation that we set out there.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "I have a question on the equity income from Fuji Xerox because it seems like it's something else, it's another part of the business model that's been moving around a bit and I guess the question is, when you guys put together, originally, the '09 guidance, did you have the type of contributions that you're now seeing from Fuji Xerox baked into that guidance?  I guess is it coming in line with your expectations or has it moved away from your expectations?", "Ursula M. Burns", "It did move away from our expectations, it's coming in significant lower than we thought.  Business, flow-through business, economic impacts plus restructuring are both coming in worse than we thought.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "You talked about and, Ursula, this is probably best taken by you perhaps, you talked about post-sale trends in the U.S. and in Europe being about as expected, like steady with Q1.  Can you talk about overall European trends relative to overall U.S. trends, how things changed or didn't change as you moved through the quarter relative to your expectations?", "Ursula M. Burns", "They didn't change, unfortunately, they were about the same.  Europe and North America are still seeing the impacts of a slow economy and we didn't see a change in Europe vis-\u00e0-vis the U.S. at all in quarter two to quarter one.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Murray, Carret & Company", "So things didn't get incrementally more challenging in Europe, as you went forward either?", "Ursula M. Burns", "No, not incrementally more challenging or better.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research", "Ursula, can you talk a little bit about sort of global imagining and what you're seeing in small business and medium business in the U.S. and sort of thoughts on how that business may expand or potential opportunities for small acquisitions?", "And then, if you could talk a little bit about developing markets.  I know they're sort of on different sides of the spectrum, but I'm just curious as to sort of, any signs of any stabilization, obviously down substantially this quarter, or sort of how you're thinking about developing markets as you go through the next few quarters, and maybe even 2010.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Global imagining first, global imagining is faring a little bit better than the main business that we have and the other channels that we have.  There are acquiring, they acquired a company earlier this year.  They are always looking out for them.  As Larry said, all tuck in distribution acquisitions we'll take.  They accrete revenue almost immediately, so they're good to do.  Not a whole lot of them out there currently on the plate, but we're always looking.  ", "Small and medium business is suffering in the United States similar to other segments of the economy, struggling with growth, struggling with access to credit.  We happen to have a good position here.  We have a good channel.  We have a good infrastructure for financing, so they are doing better than most.  DMO is like the tail of two cities.  DMO is Russia, Eurasia, these economies.  I said in my talk earlier that I was in Russia earlier this year.  It's a difficult environment, very difficult environment.", "Large companies, but small and medium business as well are suffering from an upheaval in the economic environment in these portions of the world and we're seeing it in our revenue stream, some significant declines.  We are managing that business extremely tightly, not investing ahead of the curve, taking cost and expense out.", "We have a good flexible model in DMO.  So we can actually move cost fairly aggressively and we have done that.  We're not one to position ourselves so negatively that when the economy turns around that we can't take advantage.  Our brand is strong there.  Our management team, leadership team is strong there.  So very difficult environment in the DMO territories, but we are managing it extremely well and positioning ourselves for growth when the economy turns around.  And, by the way, the economy turning around, it won't be in DMO and it won't be this year.  I'm pretty sure.", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research", "Can you just talk a bit more about Fuji Xerox and what you think in terms of their opportunities for improving?  You know, they continue to restructure.  At what point do you think that will sort of settle down and I know Japan remains very weak.  And we were over there not that long ago and it was not exactly happy.  But I'm just kind of curious as to what you're thinking about Fuji Xerox over the next several quarters.", "Ursula M. Burns", "We want Fuji Xerox to manage their business very similarly to the way that we are managing our business, which is to focus on getting their costs in line to deal with the fact that the economies in their regions are weak.  They are doing that.  They're taking aggressive actions on restructuring, as you can see from the results.", "Japan is a major piece of their business, Fuji Xerox's business.  Japan is particularly weak.  So when you add those two things together we are pushing Fuji Xerox, focusing on them being extremely aggressive in managing cost and expense, but also focusing on investing for the future.  We get strong offerings from them, so we want them to continue doing that cost and expense management as their economies continue to be weak.", "We have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Richard Gardner with Citigroup. ", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Ursula, I just wanted to \u2013 it's more of a confirmation of something that you said earlier.  I wanted to make sure that you had said I believe you said that channel inventories on supplies were stable, that you didn't see any additional big draw down during the quarter.  And I wanted to gauge your level of confidence that there won't be additional channel inventory drawdown as we go into the back half of the year on supplies. ", "Ursula M. Burns", "You are correct, Richard.  I did say that channel inventory has reached a level that we have seen to be consistent, low level.  It's hard for me to say what they will do going forward.  We are planning for, and assuming that the channel inventories will stay as they are now.  If we start to see a turn in either direction, up or down, we'll react accordingly.  Up will make sure that we can supply the demand and down will continue to tighten our belt to make sure that we can deliver the earnings that we set.  So not a big change from what I said earlier.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup", "Thank you.", "Ursula M. Burns", "That closes our review.  Thank you for the questions.  That closes our review of quarter two earnings.  You can count on this leadership team to continue our strong focus on driving shareholder value.

She is joined by Larry Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. During this call Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor.", "At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or re-broadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox.", "(Operator Instructions) Some of the subject matter that is discussed during this conference call is addressed in the Registration Statement on Form F-4, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that includes a joint proxy statement prospectus. We urge investors and security holders at Xerox to read the joint proxy statement prospectus because it contains important information.

Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019ll get started on Slide 3. In a tough year, we delivered a strong close to 2009 with results that reflect our disciplined approach to managing cash and reducing costs.", "Full year adjusted earnings came in at $0.60 per share, above our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57. In Q4 we delivered $0.25 per share, above our expectations of $0.20 to $0.22. The results exclude a $0.05 charge for the acquisition related costs we disclosed last month. The ACS acquisition is on track to close in early February and we\u2019re making excellent progress on our synergy initiatives. We\u2019ll talk more about that after the Quarter 4 review.", "Cash from operations was very strong. We generated $967 million in operating cash during Q4 and $2.2 billion for full year 2009. That\u2019s $500 million better than our previous guidance. ", "Total debt came down $1.1 billion in 2009. This excludes the $2 billion of ACS related notes issued last month. The company ended the year with a cash balance of $3.8 billion, which includes the financing raised to support the acquisition.", "Selling, administrative and general expenses were up year-over-year by $23 million, driven by currency. And SAG as a percent of revenue was 26.7% in the fourth quarter. Gross margin of 39.9% improved 2 points in Q4. So we\u2019re pleased with our progress in delivering solid, bottom line results and operating cash, the result of heavy lifting and cost and expense management and across the board operational improvements. ", "The results also reflect the modest improvement we\u2019re seeing in revenue. Modest is the key word here. During the quarter, our developing markets improved relative to the major downturn in these geographies last year, but we have not seen a significant or consistent shift towards increased spending on document technology in the U.S. and Europe, especially in large enterprises.", "While we remain quite confident in our global competitive position, we are seeing strength in services signings and in our channels businesses, we believe revenue will continue to be under pressure until there is a more sustainable economic recovery. Therefore, we remain sharply focused on sizing our business to better match current revenue levels. We\u2019ll implement additional cost reduction activities throughout the year. This gives us more flexibility in our business so we can improve operating margins while maintaining investments to drive growth.", "As a result, we\u2019ll take a restructuring charge of approximately $250 million in the first quarter. Larry will talk more about this in a moment. He will also review our financial performance. Then we\u2019ll both take your questions.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 4 for a bit more color on revenue. Fourth quarter total revenue of $4.2 billion was down 3% including a 4 point benefit from currency. Post sale and financing revenue was flat or down 4% in constant currency and equipment sale revenue declined 15% in constant currency. We saw improvement in our post sale revenue which reflects some pick up in supplies and the benefit of our customers retaining their Xerox equipment throughout this recession.", "Our install base remains stable and will continue to help boost our annuity stream as the economy improves. Post sale revenue also benefits from strong signings for Xerox\u2019s managed print services. We lead in this growth market and we continue to see demand for Xerox\u2019s value proposition of saving clients up to 30% on their document costs. ", "An encouraging sign of economic stability was evident in our equipment sale revenue. It grew over 40% sequentially and that\u2019s well above the historic norms for Quarter 3 to Quarter 4 seasonal growth. This progress is reflected in our office business where we saw greater channel activity that supports the S&B market. ", "In office, our operating margin improved, supplies revenue grew and install activity was strong for the new Color Qube multifunction system, launched in the U.S. earlier this year and in Europe in September. Color Qube\u2019s Solid Ink Technology helps cut the cost of color printing by up to 62%. It\u2019s a great example of how Xerox continues to leverage innovation and customer value to maintain and grow share, even in this tough economy.", "Our production business is particularly hard hit by the economy but new products like the 7002 and 8002 Digital Color Presses and our leading iGen System delivered solid performance in Q4. While maintaining our strong commitment to and leadership in the graphic arts marketplace, we\u2019ll focus some of our 2010 restructuring activities on improving the operating margins in this business.", "To sum up the revenue picture for Q4, we saw some signs of stability, specifically in developing markets, our distributors, OEM channels and Canada, and through demand for our new Color Technology and Xerox managed print services. We\u2019re maintaining our investments in key areas that will have long term benefits. In fact, we launched 34 products in 2009 and continue to expand our distribution throughout the world.", "And through our acquisition of ACS we\u2019ll be the world leader in business process and document management. As important, we are making additional operational improvements to align our business with the dynamics we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace. These actions position us well to deliver a strong 2010.", "Now I\u2019ll turn it over to Larry who will share more detail about our financials. Larry?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. 2009 presented our business and management team with significant challenges, a worldwide recession driving down demand and volumes; a credit crisis impacting access rates and creating liquidity pressures on our channels and customers; and the negative effects of currency changes on our revenue and costs. We reacted by taking actions on cost and expense and cash management which enabled us to deliver above expectations given the economic realities. As we go forward we intend to keep the same discipline in place to insure positive returns for our shareholders.", "Fourth quarter and full year earnings are very positive. Our revenue trends have stabilized and we did see some improvements. Currency had a positive effect on revenue and the general trend of decline moderated. With our focus on cost reduction all year, we delivered solid gross profit margin for the quarter and the year, almost 40% and grew gross profit dollars by $25 million in the quarter. The strength of the yen continues to pressure our costs, but our actions have been successful in containing them.", "We continue to manage our expenses, RD&E and SAG with full year declines at constant currency of $414 million excluding bad debts. Fourth quarter improvements are consistent with the full year\u2019s performance but appear lower due to currency and a year-over-year one time adjustments. Operating margin was 7.9% in the quarter, 6.8% for the year, driven by our cost and expense actions.", "Other net was adjusted by $63 million or $0.05 a share to recognize the acquisition related costs associated with ACS. We had previously forecasted $0.06. We saw improvements in our equity income driven by Fuji Xerox as a result of their restructuring. They also had modest restructuring in the fourth quarter worth [inaudible]. ", "Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 20%, same as last year, driven down by the geographic mix of our results. Our EPS was $0.25 versus our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22 and $0.60 for the year versus our guidance of $0.55 to $0.57.", "Next Slide. Given the 2009 environment, we challenged our management teams around the world to manage cash as the number one priority. They did and delivered cash from operations of almost $1 billion in the fourth quarter and $2.2 billion for the year versus a forecast of $1.7 billion. Achievements were where we wanted them to be, profit and working capital. Fourth quarter working capital improvements were $489 million and $758 million for the year. In addition, we managed CapEx to only $193 million for the year.", "We reduced our debt by $1 billion and accessed the capital markets for $2 billion at attractive rates to finance our acquisition of ACS. This allowed us to close out our bridge facility loan commitment. ", "We ended the year with $3.8 billion of cash. This performance reinforces the cash flow strength of Xerox. Year after year, our annuity based business model has delivered on a consistent basis free cash flow that yields significant cash flow per share. Even if I leave out this year of $2.29, the free cash flow per share averages over $1.40 for the past few years. We expect our performance to continue going forward. The addition of ACS will further strengthen our performance as their business model is annuity based and delivers strong cash performance.", "Next Slide. Four topics I will quickly cover. Currency, with the euro versus the dollar at about 1.48 in the fourth quarter 2009 versus 1.31 in Q4 2008, we have reached the point where translation currency is now helping us on revenue. Transaction currency, primarily yen although flattening out at 89 to 90 to the dollar and 132 to 134 to the euro, it is still challenging to our cost base. However, we are starting to lap the sharp rise in the yen. We continue to focus on cost actions to enable us to maintain and improve our gross profit margin.", "Receivables, both write-offs and provisions remain stable at less than 1% of receivables. Year-over-year bad debt provisions had nominal impact in the quarter, which is an improvement sequentially. The bottom part of the Slide addresses our financing dynamic to give a perspective in context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment grade credit rating.", "The equipment that we finance for our customers represents about $7.6 billion in finance assets. This is a committed stream of cash that our customers pay us over the life of their contract with Xerox. We leverage these assets 7 to 1 to derive the $6.6 billion of financing debt on the Slide. The remaining $2.7 billion is core debt. Approximately $2 billion of the core debt represents the debt we took on in December to finance the ACS transaction. ", "The debt ladder shows how we managed the debt maturities and balanced with operating cash flow. As is shown by the chart, we maintain these maturities at about $1 billion a year. Contrast this to our cash flow from ops over the last seven years which has been $1.5 to $2.2 billion. As debt matures, we typically go to capital markets to maintain our 7:1 ratio. So our debt is increased to pay the ACS acquisition, remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment, our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong and we will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010 to quickly pay down the incremental ACS debt and enable a return to other cash usages such as share repurchase during 2011.", "Next Slide. Post sale revenue has shown improvement in the fourth quarter, particularly in supplies. Unbundled supplies and other sales were flat year-over-year. This is an improved trend even considering weak results last year. In addition developing markets showed improvement in the quarter with almost no impact on post sale versus previous quarters, where it represented a third of the impact. ", "Service and rental and outsourcing, which represents 65% of post sale, I would characterize as consistent with what we saw in previous quarters. Throughout this downturn, this has been the most stable of the streams, down this quarter $59 million on a base of $2 billion. And I anticipate steady improvement. Our machines in the field remain a positive indicator, growing at 17% for color and 1% for total digital. Pagers continue to show pressure driven by mono production declines. So overall, a modest improvement in the post sale revenue trend.", "Next Slide. Our full year guidance of both earnings and cash will be based on a Xerox ACS combined company. Our adjusted EPS for 2010 of $0.75 to $0.85 and $2.6 billion for cash from operations is consistent with the guidance we gave at third quarter earnings even though we will only have about 11 months of combined operations. We will differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give transparency into the fundamentals of the business. ", "2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles, restructuring and asset impairment costs, acquisition related costs including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs, and any discrete unusual items. The major differences between adjusted earnings and GAAP EPS are an estimated $280 million in restructuring charges, $75 million in acquisition related costs and $375 million in amortization of intangibles. In addition, there is one discrete item that will effect first quarter and full year 2010. In January Venezuela devalued its currency. As a result, we expect to record a $22 million charge in Q1 for the re-measurement of the impacted assets. Other than this charge, we don\u2019t expect this to affect our results as Venezuela is less than $75 million of our revenue. ", "The restructuring charge is consistent with insuring that our cost and expense structure is in line with our current business model. For the full year, we expect $280 million of restructuring which includes the $250 million in the first quarter plus an estimated $30 million balance of the year. Of the $250 million, $210 million is severance and $40 million is non-cash asset write-offs. We expect annualized savings of $205 million, $140 million of which the majority will benefit us in the latter part of 2010. In addition, we anticipate Q1 Fuji Xerox restructuring of approximately $25 million, which we will include in our adjustments.", "So in summary we continue to manage our company with discipline, exceeding earnings in cash commitments while positioning our business for strength going forward. Now back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Larry. That\u2019s a good lead in to a status on our acquisition of ACS. As I mentioned earlier, we are on track to close this transaction early next month. The shareholder meeting for both Xerox and ACS are February 5 and our acquisition operations office is making significant progress on the revenue and cost synergy projects we outlined last quarter. We\u2019ve delivered over 60 initiatives that are managed across four teams, corporate governance, delivery and infrastructure, sales and innovation. Through these initiatives we remain confident that we\u2019ll deliver $100 million in profit synergies during year one, ramping to over $375 million by year three.", "Here\u2019s a quick snapshot of our progress to date. Our corporate governance team has created new organizational models to support the combined governance structure. Our delivery and infrastructure team has prioritized the areas where we can achieve productivity improvements through outsourcing and implementation of ACS\u2019s proprietary activity based compensation. ", "The sales team has focused on everything from the sales process to compensation to customer engagement and is prepared to implement cross selling opportunities for our client relationship managers. More than 90% of ACS\u2019s business is in North America and only 20% of our customers overlap. We\u2019re ready to start pursuing this major market opportunity as soon as the deal closes.", "And our innovation team has tested and validated Xerox technology that will help ACS automate current manual based work processes and create differentiated new offerings to help their clients reduce costs. So I\u2019m very pleased with our progress to date and remain confident in the great value this acquisition brings to our business, our customers and our shareholders.", "Let\u2019s turn to Slide 11 to wrap up, then Larry and I will take your questions. During a very challenging year, we focused our priorities on generating strong operating cash flow, reducing costs and generating and strengthening our competitive position through breakthrough innovation like Color Qube and value based offerings like managed print services. We delivered, even exceeded on our commitment in these areas and more. At the same time, we took a hard look at the fundamentals of our business and made the strategic decision that even in tough times, we must change and invest to grow. Our acquisition of ACS is designed to do just that and is a natural evolution for our business. We\u2019ll expand from being not just a leader in document management but also a leader in business process outsourcing, helping to simplify and automate document driven work. It opens new opportunities for our brand, our business and for the customers that we serve.", "In 2010 our objectives are very clear. ACS is a top priority. As important, we\u2019ll continue to focus on maintaining leadership in our core document management business, bringing new innovation to market and expanding distribution channels around the world. In fact, we are set to launch differentiating technology in both our office and production businesses this year. ", "Through cost and expense management restructuring, we\u2019ll size our business right to drive improved margin. And we\u2019ll continue to generate strong cash flow while reducing debt. We\u2019re starting the year with first quarter guidance of adjusted earnings per share of $0.11 to $0.13. This excludes $0.24 in adjustments for the first quarter and reflects only a partial quarter of ACS [inaudible].

Burns", "It was okay from a sequential standpoint and we did see some strengthening of revenue, particularly in DMO where the revenue as you know in the previous quarters, particularly in Quarter 4 of 2008 and [inaudible] 2009 were significantly pressured by the downturns [inaudible]. We did see improvement in just about every country in DMO from a revenue standpoint and activity standpoint for sure, so that was a good significantly.", "We also did see an improvement in supplies. Our SMB business channels that cover our SMB marketplace improved slightly as well. We still see pressure in U.S. and in Europe, particularly in large enterprises and we still see pressure almost across the board in our black-and-white high end production business. Color by the way, color at the high end especially with the new 7002 and 8002 and in the office with the Color Qube is trending better. And so overall, you know, kind of a balanced picture in some geographies picking up, some not so much and color the place where we\u2019re investing a lot of energy doing a lot better.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "", "Was there any difference in terms of linearity this year versus other years?", "Ursula M. Burns", "There was. Quarter 4 always sequentially is always better than Quarter 3, but this Quarter 4 was better than a normal Quarter 4 over Quarter 3, particularly in equipment. We saw it across the board, but equipment improvement was strong. Generally Quarter 4 is about, let\u2019s say about 20% higher than Quarter 3 but we did see this quarter about 40%, so 20 additional points of improvement. So not a normal Quarter 4 for us, a stronger Quarter 4 on a lower base, though, but a stronger Quarter 4.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "", "Larry, can you talk a little bit about sustainability of cash flow? Clearly some of the working capital improvements probably won\u2019t necessarily repeat themselves, but how should we think about cash flow from a core Xerox standpoint and then is there anything that we should keep in mind with regard to cash flow as we look forward through the year as you incorporate in ACS?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Thank you, Shannon. Well first of all, I think the first thing is to look at the last seven years and we consistently every year that we have a good year with cash the question comes up about sustainability. And so I think sustainability of this cash model after seven years speaks for itself, number one. Number two, we\u2019re committed to the $2.6 billion that we forecasted back in October. We\u2019re reconfirming it now which is the combined companies. And you know I see improvements across the board. Obviously we had tremendous working capital improvements in the fourth quarter so you would expect this of 2010 to be delayed towards the end of the year. And if you look at 2009, if you looked at the first quarter you wouldn\u2019t have projected $2.2 billion for the year. So I think we\u2019re going to see a build up and a skew of cash in 2010, especially as we take on ACS for the 11 months of it. But we\u2019re confident we can make our projections here.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "With regard to your slideshow from actually three months ago, I just wanted to go back to a couple of things you said. You\u2019ve reiterated your view for the combined company of $0.75 to $0.85 but then at that time you also laid out $0.95 to $1.05 for 2011 and $1.10 to $1.20 for the combined company in 2012. So given that you overachieved in the fourth quarter, how do you feel about the numbers for 2011 and 2012 now that you\u2019ve overachieved in the fourth quarter and you\u2019ve got more of the planning process under you?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We remain extremely confident about our 2011 and for that matter 2012, I know it\u2019s a little bit far out, EPS numbers, cash numbers, the model that we laid out three months ago and even five months ago actually is doing nothing but strengthening as we work more and more with ACS and we manage our business on a daily basis. So there\u2019s $0.95 to $1.05 and $1.10 to $1.20 and the $2.6 billion in cash in 2010 and $2.8 in \u201911 are numbers that we remain committed to and are confident in.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "", "So obviously when ACS reports tonight no surprises and kind of steady as she goes?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We expect none but a basic report.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "", "I just wanted to go through something with regard to your core gross margin. Obviously the yen hurt you on the cost side but is the yen causing your competitors to price more benign in this environment? When they have to bring back overseas sales for them it\u2019s a hit so you know is the yen actually causing the pricing environment in the market to be more benign than it usually is and is that keeping gross margins stable at all? And can you talk about the pricing environment as it relates to that?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Ben, it\u2019s interesting that we\u2019ve seen stability throughout this recession in the pricing environment. We see price declines of around 5% to 10%. This is kind of in the range that we\u2019ve seen for every quarter in 2009, you know, up or down a little bit on the edges but we\u2019ve seen no significant change in trend in pricing in the marketplace.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "", "Larry, blended tax rate for the combined company, what\u2019s your best view of that?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "32%.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "", "And blended gross margin just a little higher than the average?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Blended gross margin is between 33% and 35%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "Ursula, just if you could, maybe give us a little bit more detail for what you guys saw in the small medium business, the improvement there and in the supplies as well. I guess where did you see it specifically and then maybe on the supply side since it sounds like its more SMB related do you think that the sell in that you saw is indicative of sort of what year end demand is or do you think there could be some channel fill there?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I\u2019ll start with DMO first. I mean DMO is a market that is essentially a small to medium business market and we did see improvement in our product set and our activity levels as I said in just about every country in DMO that was a good indicator for the small to medium business market in that segment of the world. In our North American and European countries we did see stronger performance in our channels business. It\u2019s hard to say strength but stronger performance in our channels business. So this is our resellers.", "We did see a stabilization of the stocking levels that our channels have. As you know through 2009 we went through a significant destocking in the channels and where they\u2019re at now, where they were actually in Quarter 3 as well is a level that\u2019s been maintained. So we expect for that to grow as the economy improves. We don\u2019t expect additional significant degradation of that and we do believe that some of it is sell through, not only sell in. The economy is still fairly cautious out there and our resellers are very aware of cash, so we do not believe they are buying ahead of the curve. They\u2019re buying to supply customer demand.", "So we think that there is a real pick up in business there, a real pick up in activity there. And end user usage.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "On the enterprise you\u2019re not feeling it\u2019s actually doing much better but are you more optimistic sort of going into 2010 about potentiality of enterprise spending? Are you getting any anecdotal feel reaching your customer base, I suppose?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I think what we\u2019re seeing is the continued pressure on the black-and-white business in large enterprises and the graphic arts segment. But we\u2019re seeing some good news in color as we continue to push the envelope in newer and better technologies. Our 7002 and 8002 is doing extremely well in the marketplace. iGen 4 interestingly enough in Quarter 4 had a really good quarter, page volumes, activities, etc. So I do believe that we\u2019re seeing a little bit of loosening but the pressure is still there, particularly in the very large geographies in the U.S. and in Europe.", "So it\u2019s mixed. Black-and-white is still down, color stabilizing, seeing some bright spots in the marketplace.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "", "And if I could just ask on the March quarter guidance, given I guess I\u2019d say through the organic or secular strength in the core business for December you know it feels like there\u2019s maybe, well I just want to make sure there\u2019s nothing built in to the March quarter guidance that kind of implies maybe some softening in the core business because it seems like you guys if you wanted to you could have maybe guided a little bit higher. I\u2019m not saying you should have. That\u2019s why I want to make sure the pushes and pulls there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re not clear on in the March quarter guidance.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well I can assure you that we\u2019re going to try to get the highest actuals in the first quarter that we can but when you look at the combined companies and you look at getting two months of ACS, when you look at the fact that the synergies come later in the year, when you look at the fact that the restructuring helps us later in the year, I think it\u2019s a really good representative guidance.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co.", "", "Larry, it feels like there\u2019s a couple of things that have happened that could serve as sort of tailwinds, at least on the margin, that probably weren\u2019t baked into the original 2010 combined company EPS guidance. I guess one would be a little bit lower financing cost and it seems like after today\u2019s report and your comments about what to expect from the JV perhaps a little bit of an incremental benefit there that wasn\u2019t baked in. Is that a correct assumption?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well I think you\u2019re pointing out positive things but whether or not they were baked in, I mean we bake in a lot of assumptions. Some get a little better, some get a little worse and you know our expectation is that we can, you know, these are again projections out in time.

And what is implied for core Xerox growth rate but baked into that number?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes, the first question I am comfortable with the $22 billion. You know some of this is adjusting for currency here, so we have to be careful. Who knows where the currency goes? But you know the two businesses together will be around $22 billion for sure, so I\u2019m comfortable, number one. Number two, I think we can assume that from a core business standpoint we expect to see modest improvement going forward that hopefully will get better as we go through the year and the economy gets better.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Do you expect core Xerox to grow constant currency basis in 2010?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "I wanted to get more color on restructuring.

And can you split that between restructuring of the core Xerox business and integration or restructuring related to the combination?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Of the $250 million that we referred to as happening in Quarter 1 that\u2019s all core business restructuring, Xerox restructuring. It\u2019s about 2,500 people. It\u2019s split about a third of the benefit, the cost line, is in R&D, a third will be in gross profit and then a third in SAG. The areas that we\u2019re focusing on are the supply chain, obviously manufacturing to the supply chain is something that we continually focus on; the back office functions; technical service and managed services and that\u2019s driven primarily by efficiencies; technology efficiencies, you know, machines break less and so on and so forth and we\u2019ve become more efficient; and then we have done a pretty big infrastructure change in Europe and that will allow us to reduce some of the heads there as well. And then obviously in development and engineering costs on the R&D side.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "I guess I\u2019m trying to reconcile the relatively positive outlook for revenue with incremental restructuring. Why isn\u2019t that incremental restructuring flowing through into better earnings guidance going forward?", "Ursula M. Burns", "First of all we did, if you looked at our guidance, we did contemplate significant cost reductions in 2010. The restructuring is a way to get at those cost reductions. The reality is that we are about a $2 billion plus company smaller than we were when we entered 2009. And the restructuring is to assure that we can do some of the good things that we should be doing, which is invest a little bit more in our people and just a little bit in the business; keep our margins strong; keep our earnings strong; and size the business for our $15 billion revenue stream growing versus a $17.5 billion revenue stream. It\u2019s that simple. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Just to follow on from Chris, Larry did you say that the $250 million restructuring or $280 million in restructuring this year for core Xerox that that would translate into $200 million in annual savings? Did I hear that right?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes.", "Ursula M. Burns", "", "That is correct. It\u2019s $250 for core Xerox, $30 million when we join the companies together.

The deal hasn\u2019t closed yet. What core Xerox is in terms of EPS guidance?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a productive thing to do personally. I mean we\u2019re going to be a combined company and to split EPS when you\u2019ve put two companies together is just not a productive thing to do. So our guidance is with both companies together. You just can\u2019t go forward when you start to mix companies and break out what somebody\u2019s EPS would have been had you not been together. It\u2019s just not. Productive is the best word I could use there.", "Ursula M.

It was about 6% in the previous quarters. Color pages were up in this quarter and were up throughout the year. So I expect the trend to remain the same, improving slightly in the black-and-white space, but not significantly, and improving in the color space. So more color page growth in 2010 versus 2009. Machines in the field are stable, color miss is growing, digital miss is growing so we expect even though we\u2019re pressuring on the black-and-white high end business, we expect the pages to stabilize at a slight decline and color pages to continue to grow.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "", "So total pages a slight decline for CY \u201910, Ursula?", "Ursula M.

In other words does the factoring receivables go up or stay about these levels and how do you think about that transition?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well the factoring year to year helps us $100 million in the fourth quarter and $100 million for the year.

So yes, it was about $257, you\u2019re right, sequentially.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes. So, well sequentially is a different subject. I mean we always do more, there\u2019s more receivables in the fourth quarter. But year to year we did increase $100 million in the fourth quarter and that same $100 million is for the full year. And for 2010 we\u2019re going to have program consistent, whether or not it ends up $50 million more than the year before or $50 million less. We\u2019ll have to see how it goes. These programs are done quarter by quarter but my expectation is it will be around you know the same kinds of numbers that we did this year.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Fair enough. Thanks very much, guys.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "I just had one other point I wanted to make. When I was asked about the gross profit margin of the combined companies I said $0.33 to $0.35 and that includes keeping the core business in the range of $0.39 to $0.40. ACS has a margin in the services business. You know they have a lower SAG and they have a lower gross profit margin and they actually end up with a very good operating margin. Their gross margin is around the 18% to 20% range. So when you weight the profit dollars you get the $0.33 to $0.35. So there\u2019s no decline really in the base business or the others. They just have a lower SG&A as it relates to gross profit margin.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "", "I wanted to follow up on Chris\u2019s and Keith\u2019s questions earlier, Larry, if I could, regarding the incremental restructuring of the core business for 2010. I just want to get a sense since you\u2019re not really going to update the EPS guidance, the incremental cost savings, are you going to reinvest that in sales coverage? Is there something we should think about in terms of maybe trying to get a little more out of the gate in terms of momentum when you close ACS? In terms of getting out there and spreading the word? Or is this more of a signal that you\u2019re still a little cautiously optimistic about the large enterprise coming back this year?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "No. It\u2019s none of the above. You just have to go back to 2009. We entered 2009 and we tried to do as many cost and expense actions that we could that would offset revenue decline and not use up cash. So they generally were not associated with restructuring. They were things like reducing the 401(k). They were things like having no salary increases. They were things like not giving raises to people, cutting travel, all those kinds of things that generally are not sustainable forever. Our people have done a great job. They deserve to get raises. They deserve to have some of their 401(k) come back. So there\u2019s a lot of positive things that have to be done here.", "In addition to this, a little bit of what Ursula said, when we did these cost and expense actions we didn\u2019t know the revenue was actually going to end up $2.5 billion down between currency and demand. And so when you look back at what we did to make 2009 a really good year in this environment, we have to make trade-offs now going forward to get our going forward cost base consistent with $15 billion of Xerox business. You know we still have 100% of the cost actions we took and we had all this restructuring. Some of those cost actions are going to go back to normal cycle and we needed restructuring to downsize ourselves consistent with the revenue.", "So that\u2019s pretty much the story. You have to tie 2009 actions to 2010.", "Mark Moskowitz - J.P. Morgan", "", "The other question revolves more around the install activity, the longer term contracts that you\u2019ve entered into in the recent months. Ursula, can you talk about the economics of years 2, 3 and 4? Are you having to throw in more goodies to get folks to sign on for multi-year engagements? Or are you kind of holding the line there in terms of the economics? Just trying to get to the margin. I\u2019ll take it terms of years 2, 3, 4 and 5.", "Ursula M. Burns", "So the way I characterize it for our management services business and then I\u2019ll do our equipment business. By the way, they\u2019re not too distinctly different from each other. We have not needed to change a normal practice that we have with the clients and that by the way that normal practice is that when you renew a contract, you renew it if it\u2019s the same exact business at a lower price than we did when we first signed on. Generally when we renew we add more services to that contract and so the total price and total cost of the contract actually does not change significantly materially. But we\u2019ve not seen a change in trend at all. We have not had to lengthen our signings or throw in more goodies as you say. It\u2019s a pretty normal business environment from that perspective. We sell equipment for 3 to 5 years. They take it. ", "We manage it for that long and we set a price over the years. Same thing with managed services contract.

I\u2019m just kind of curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about market share and shifts in a different segment.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good question. Thank you. Good question to close on as well. What we\u2019re seeing from competition, let me take it into the segments that you\u2019ve kind of divided it into. I\u2019ll start with the Japanese competitors, Reko and Ikon the combination has put as you know quite a bit of pressure on Canon. And Canon and Reko therefore are kind of duking it out to fight for the old Canon [miff] that Ikon used to cover. That is not really impacting us differentially. We do sometimes see some aggressive pricing between those two and when we come in we actually have to be engaged in that price. We\u2019re increasing coverage. We have a great set of offerings. Not just the Color Qube but a whole color fleet that we launched in 2009. So our activity and our participation in that market is stronger. It was stronger in 2009 than even in 2008 and you\u2019ll see in both black-and-white office and in color office that we\u2019ve either maintained or grew share. So I\u2019m pretty pleased competitively how we\u2019re positioned in that space.", "At the higher end, we had some weakness as you recall. At the low end of the inter-production color [face] and actually at the high end we reset the entire product set. At the high end, the 7002, the 8002 just hit the market not too long ago and iGen 4 is going very, very well. So our share in those segments of the marketplace should be strong, particularly in Quarter 4 and Quarter 1 of 2010.", "Competition there is not any more aggressive than it\u2019s always been. It\u2019s been fairly aggressive but our product set, our coverage, etc., puts is in good stead. Oc\u00e9 Canon, we really haven\u2019t seen anything on Oc\u00e9 Canon. It hasn\u2019t closed and if anything it\u2019s been an opportunity for us as the Oc\u00e9 guys are trying to figure out who they belong to. Our continuous feed products continue to gain share, continue to do very well from an install base and a page volume base and continue to gain share. So from the competitive standpoint fairly good.", "HP, we don\u2019t really see them a whole lot across the board. I mean they\u2019re obviously out there. They\u2019re a very good company, very large, but most of our battles on an equipment base is with the Japanese competitors not with HP that much. ", "And then on the services side we\u2019re doing extremely well in managed print services. Gartner just gave us yet another accolade as being the number one provider in this space. So our services signings are the highest signings level in the Quarter 4 time for the whole year. Services are doing well.", "But believe it or not, from a competitive position we\u2019re holding our own or doing better.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "", "Great. Thank you.", "Ursula M.

Second Quarter 2010 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She's joined by Larry Zimmerman, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. ", "During this call Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corp., today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions] ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. Our second quarter results reflect strong across-the-board improvements in driving revenue growth, generating cash and expanding earnings. I'm quite pleased with our solid performance. And I'm confident that we'll continue to deliver consistent, steady progress throughout the year. ", "Along with reporting Q2 earnings today, we're also raising full-year earnings guidance. It's a good sign of our improving business and momentum in the marketplace. ", "So let's start with a review of the quarter. Just as a reminder, considering the acquisition of ACS that closed in February and its related expenses, we\u2019re reporting not only GAAP earnings, but also adjusted earnings per share. And to ensure we're providing clarity on year-over-year compares, we're also reporting on a pro forma basis, which assumes that ACS was in our 2009 results. ", "Our second quarter pro forma revenue was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency. We delivered Q2 adjusted EPS of $0.24, above our guidance of $0.20 to $0.22. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.16 per share. This includes restructuring and intangibles, as well as acquisition-related and litigation costs. ", "Cash from operations continued to be quite strong at $678 million in Q2. For the first half of the year, we generated $1.1 billion, keeping us well on track to meet our full-year operating cash expectations of $2.6 billion. Through disciplined cost and expense management, our operating margin of 10.1% was up nearly one point on a pro forma basis. Revenue and cost synergy targets related to the acquisition are on target. I'll provide more detail about this in a moment.", "First, let me review our revenue results and Larry will cover our financial performance and I'll close and we'll both take your questions.", "So let's turn to Slide 4. The first quarter, we introduced our new revenue categories and segments to better reflect the balance between our Technology and Services businesses, each of which represent about 46% of total revenue. Our revenue categories are now Equipment and Annuity. Equipment revenue represents the sale of our document technology. Annuity includes everything else, recurring revenue associated with our Technology and Services business. It represents about 83% of our total revenue. ", "Our segments are now Technology, Services and Other. Revenue from Technology includes the sale of document systems as well as the supplies, technical service and financing of products. Revenue from Services represents our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing offerings.", "Total revenue of $5.5 billion was up 48%, including a one point impact from currency. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2%, or 3% in constant currency.", "Annuity revenue on a pro forma basis was flat in the quarter and up 1% in constant currency. And we made good progress in Equipment sales growth, up 14%. This is the payoff of decisions that we made at the height of the recession to continue investing in new products. It is also a result of our ramp up in marketing spending to drive more Equipment sales. We launched 34 products in 2009 and another 14 through the first half of this year. So as the economy has turned more positive, we've been winning in the marketplace and saw the benefit this quarter in Equipment sales and install activity. ", "You can expect this increased investment in marketing to continue, both in demand-generation campaigns that support our product sales and in brand-building awareness around our expanded offering in Business Process and Information Technology Outsourcing.", "Let's turn to Slide 5. In our Technology business, we closely monitor page growth and Machines in Field, or MIF. It's always worth repeating that our Technology business helps to fuel our Annuity stream. More MIF leads to more pages, which generate more revenue from supplies and technical service.", "For Q2, we saw a steady growth in MIF, supported by a 45% increase in install. This install activity reflects strong demand across all segments, including a 56% increase in entry-level devices. That's a good indicator of accelerated demand from developing markets and small and mid-sized businesses, most of which comes through our indirect channels or network of Global Imaging companies. ", "As important, our leadership in color printing continues to drive an increase in share of MIF and pages, important trends that generate more revenue and gross profits than our business from black-and-white systems. Total color revenue grew 8% in the quarter, reflecting the continued success of our ColorQube MFP and a very strong launch in Q2 of the Xerox Color 800 and 1000 series. Color pages were up 9% year over year and grew a point sequentially from quarter one. It's a good sign that uses trends continue to improve, helping to offset declines in black-and-white pages. We saw sequential page growth across most categories. The most notable decline was in production black-and-white. This is no surprise, since the total production monochrome market is declining. It's still a highly profitable business and one that we benefit from, however, our growth strategy and where we're aligning our investment is all about advancing customized digital printing to create more color pages. ", "In some cases, we're replacing monochrome pages with color. In many other areas, we're generating new color pages through applications that can only exist because of the advantages of our digital technology. Think photo books and highly personalized direct mail as examples.", "In the services side of our business, which has tripled since the ACS acquisition, signings were $4.2 billion, up from $3.9 billion in Q1. On a trailing 12-month basis, signings grew 12%. And the pipeline continues to look exceptionally strong from our Business Process, Information Technology and Document Outsourcing stock offerings. The joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS, plus increased interest in our diverse services portfolio, led to a significant Q2 increase in pipeline. ", "So to sum up the quarter, we're seeing consistent, positive trends in the marketplace since the beginning of the year. For us, these are signs of modest yet steady economic improvement, as well as the benefit of a broad product line and expanded services. Demand continues to improve for our technology, especially in color, developing markets and from SMB.", "With Annuity revenue at 83% of total revenue and Services signings up double digits, we're getting great leverage from multi-year contracts for Business Process and Document Management. Our portfolio is now well balanced between Technology and Services, each of which contributed to a strong first half of the year. It\u2019s momentum that gives me confidence in the strong second half as well. ", "That's a good place for me to turn it over to Larry.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning. As Ursula said, we delivered second quarter earnings above our guidance, which is the result of positive trends in our business, which we expect will continue. Revenue growth improved, solid gross profit margin and dollar growth, good expense management, significant growth in earnings and operating margin and excellent cash generation. We also see continued progress in cost and revenue synergies associated with our acquisition of ACS. ", "So let's start with our Technology slides. Technology revenue grew 3%, 4% constant currency, and represented $2.6 billion or 46% of our business with a segment margin of 10.7%. We've categorized the lines of business in Technology as Entry, which includes all A4 devices and desktop printers; Mid-range, which includes A3 devices that generally serve workgroup environments in mid to large enterprises; and High-end, which includes production printing and publishing systems that generally serve the graphic communications marketplace and large enterprises.", "All of these lines continue to trend positively, with color performing well across the board. In Entry, both black-and-white and color had strong install growth reflecting the continued strength we are seeing in developing markets as well as in other channels. Mid-range also had good install activity with particular strength in color. With the ColorQube launch last year and more recent Color Laser A3 launches, we have refreshed our color products in this segment with more to come in the third quarter.", "Additionally in second quarter, we refreshed our black-and-white A3 product line, which should drive black-and-white install improvement. At the High-end, the recently launched Color 800 and 1000 is off to a strong start and helped fuel production color growth. Black-and-white improved but remains pressured, reflecting both the move to color and continued weakness in the graphic arts market.", "We were pleased with revenue growth of 4% in constant currency and segment margins of 10.7%, which improved almost a point from last year. ", "Slide 7. The Services segment is comprised of three lines of business: Business Process Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing and Information Technology Outsourcing. Revenue mix for the quarter was about 53% Business Process Outsourcing, 33% Document Outsourcing and 14% IT Outsourcing. On a pro forma basis, total revenue grew 1%, driven by BPO, which grew 3%. Growth areas included electronic payment services, federal debt card services and healthcare services. ", "Although growth was somewhat lower than in Q1, we expect stronger growth in Q3 due to strength in signings and pipeline expansion. Document Outsourcing growth improved sequentially in constant currency. ITO revenue improved sequentially and essentially showed flat revenue in the quarter.", "Operating margin was strong at 12.6%, which on a pro forma basis is 1.4 points improvement over prior year. Indicators for future revenues were very positive and signings and pipeline growth were strong. On a trailing 12-month basis, new business signings, including a growing amount of synergy signings, grew 16% and total signings of 4.2 billion grew 12%. We saw a strength in both BPO and Document Outsourcing. Signings in ITO continue to be affected by delayed decisions in large accounts. But looking forward, we see an improving pipeline. ", "On a year-over-year basis, we grew our total Services revenue by 23% including synergies, which are now over $2.5 billion. We expect to convert this pipeline into signings in the coming quarters. So overall, positive results in both Technology and Service segments.", "Slide 8. Pro forma revenue grew 2%, and 3% at constant currency, and is within our 2010 business model of 1% to 3% growth at constant currency. Gross profit margin was 34.8%, which is up almost half a point on a pro forma basis and at the high end of our 33% to 35% range. We have done a lot of cost work to offset the year-to-year pressure of changes in currency exchange rates. This cost work, coupled with hedging and currency sharing with our partner, Fuji Xerox, gives us the confidence that we will remain in the 33% to 35% gross profit margin guidance range.", "RD&E improved $8 million year-over-year driven by cost savings from restructuring. SAG increased $9 million on a pro forma basis and improved as a percent of revenue. Improvements in bad debts expense in G&A were offset by investments in selling. Improvements in all cost ratios delivered almost a point in operating margin improvement to 10.1%. Our adjusted tax rate was 32% and we delivered $0.24 of EPS on an adjusted basis, which was above our guidance as we saw improved revenue growth and good cost and expense performance.", "We continue to differentiate between GAAP earnings and adjusted earnings for guidance and actuals reporting in order to give you transparency into the fundamentals of our business. 2010 earnings on an adjusted basis will exclude amortization of intangibles; restructuring and asset impairment costs; acquisition-related costs, including direct transaction costs and specifically defined integration costs; and any discrete, usual items. So overall, a very solid quarter across all lines of the income statement.", "Slide 9. In 2Q, we delivered $678 million of cash flow from operation driven by earnings. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations is $1.1 billion. Working capital was a $90 million source of cash in the quarter, with accounts receivable more than offsetting growth in inventories. Working net capital will improve in the second half of the year. Free cash flow was $551 million, with CapEx and cost of internal software of $127 million. Our year-end estimate of CapEx is approximately $600 million. This includes about $400 million from ACS, which is consistent with their historical Cape levels.", "Cash from financing was a use of $457 million, driven by the payment of $950 million of senior notes, which came due in the quarter, partially offset by an increase in the revolver, which we anticipate paying down over the balance of the year. We ended the quarter with $1.1 billion cash balance and we are very confident in our ability to achieve our commitment of $2.6 billion cash flow from operations for the full year.", "Next slide. To continue the story on cash, we are making excellent progress on paying down debt to get to our desired leverage and achieve $1 billion of available cash in 2011. We reached a peak of $10.5 billion of debt with the closing of ACS on February 5 and have reduced debt by $900 million, or half of our $1.8 billion target for 2010. ", "In the top right box, you can see the math of the first half actuals, $1.1 billion cash flow and $900 million of debt reduction. And looking at the second half, we have $1.5 billion cash flow to go, with $900 million more debt reduction to reach our target. ", "Given our positive performance in the first half, our intention is to call in the fourth quarter our 2003 ten-year bonds of $550 million, which carry a 7 5/8% coupon and have three years remaining.  This will not only save us interest expense, but will give us increased flexibility in our debt reduction. ", "In our fourth quarter, we expect to report a $15 million charge as a discrete item, which represents $8 million of a non-cash item of unamortized issuance costs from 2003 as well as $7 million of a premium. Last point, we were confident of the $1 billion projection of available cash in 2011. ", "Now let's look at the debt in the financing dynamics box. I continue to show this debt breakdown to ensure there is perspective and context in understanding our debt and our commitment to maintaining an investment-grade rating. We have $9.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion is in support of our Financing business. The Finance receivables of $6.9 billion is a committed revenue stream from our customers. In addition, we stagger our debt ladder to be well below our annual free cash flow and total liquidity so we can access capital markets opportunistically. ", "And just to touch on receivables, we had significant improvement in second quarter year-over-year in both our write-off experience and requirements for bad-debt provisions. So we are making significant progress paying down the debt. Remaining debt supports the financing of our customer equipment. Our cash flow and financial flexibility are strong. We will focus on significant debt reduction in 2010, which will enable a return to other cash usage such as share repurchase during 2011.", "In summary, we continue to be very encouraged by our results, and we are optimistic going forward. Now I'll give it back to Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "So thanks, Larry. And before we wrap up, here's a quick update on our acquisition synergies. They're coming through three main areas: cost, revenue and innovation. During this year, the first year of the acquisition, the synergies we are achieving are primarily through cost reductions. We're ramping now in the Other areas for payoffs we'll see in years two and three. In the cost synergy category, we captured all the governance of the synergies. We're also seeing productivity gains, where we've integrated ACS\u2019s proprietary practices into our existing technical and managed services.", "To pursue revenue synergies, we are cross-selling in more than 100 accounts. From these efforts, we have over 10 new signings to date and a joint pipeline of more than $2.5 billion, up from $500 million in quarter one. ", "And the third area is innovation synergies. For the past couple of years, we've been polling the research in our lab's smaller document technologies. It's the software and data recognition tools that turn static information into more dynamic data. With ACS's offerings, our innovation is creating more automation and less paperwork, meaning faster transactions and simpler business processes. We're starting to embed these technologies across ACS, capturing savings along the way and a stronger return on our innovation investments, so good progress on all fronts. And I'm personally tracking it with the team on a regular basis. In doing so, I am confident that we'll deliver above our $100 million target for year one. ", "Let's turn to Slide 12, then Larry and I will take your question.  We are now a new Xerox. And I always like to remind customers, investors and our people of that. Xerox is now the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. We are expanding offerings through our broad distribution channels, through our global scale, our renowned brand and our innovation. We're more differentiated in the marketplace and we're more competitively advantaged. The benefits are reflected in our first half results. Revenue was up, we generated strong cash flow and we improved operating margins. And as a result, adjusted earnings were above our guidance and position us well to raise our expectations for the full year. ", "For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.19 to $0.21 per share. And for the full year, we now expect adjusted EPS to be $0.88 to $0.92 per share. That's an increase from our previous guidance of $0.75 to $0.85 per share. ", "With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross", "Ursula, can you provide just some more commentary on what you're hearing from your customers, both geographic as well as vertical in terms of demand, how they\u2019re feeling about their budgets, and just any color you can give?", "Ursula Burns", "Overall, still very cautious across the board. But we're seeing some lift in certain areas, just like we did in quarter one. Small and mid-sized customers are investing a little bit more. They invested more in quarter one and fortunately continued to invest a little bit more in quarter two. In our developing markets, the activity is strong. Customers are a bit more confident. Obviously, financing and all that has loosened up a bit, so our DMO activities are strong as well. Enterprise customers, we're seeing stability with some signs of hope, some signs of life. Color is doing better than black-and-white in enterprise, especially at the High-end, but still a little cautious. So color is good and black-and-white still I\u2019m not investing that heavily. Good results on a quarter-over-quarter basis though. So some solid outlook from quarter-over-quarter basis. ", "In Europe, what we're seeing is -- interestingly, despite all of the bad news, we're seeing a pretty strong business environment. Clearly, there is caution, clearly there are questions, but what we see is continued investment in color, continued investment in the new technologies we're putting out and definitely continued invest in Services. So not -- so overall balanced results. ", "And in government -- so just let me cover government because that's another high point. Another interesting point, we hear a lot about pressure on government, but what we're seeing in particularly our Services area, which is where we have the most immediate response, we see that government, state and local, is still very interested in our offerings, very strong positions there. Growth there, so signings are up there. Our pipeline is very strong in state and local governments, because what we provide to them are services that either are mandated by a federal government so they have to do it or they provide either cost cutting or some level of efficiency. So activity with the government is up. Lots of conversations, lots of signings and good pipeline. So overall, it's reasonable, balanced, and revenue --because of that revenue is growing.", "Shannon Cross", "Then can you talk a little bit -- I mean, the $2.5 billion for the pipeline of Services, clearly from sort of revenue synergies, is really strong. Where is that relative to sort of where your expectations were? And how far do you think you are in terms of milking that 100 customers that you've talked about?", "Ursula Burns", "So the $2.5 billion that we talked about is, I would say, at the higher end of our expectations, so strong. We knew that -- and we talked about this in the first quarter that we knew that people were interested in what we -- in the new offering, the new Xerox. And we knew that because they called us or because when we called them they were very excited to speak to us. That's now turning into literally deals that we can put our hands on. And even though not all signed yet -- we have 10 deals -- over 10 deals signed, but $2.5 billion of pipeline is all interest that's been gated to us. So net-net at the high end of what we expected. So positive, positive so far.", "Shannon Cross", "And then I\u2019ve got a question for Larry. Can you just talk a bit about how you\u2019re managing currency, both euro and yen? Clearly, euro more top line and I guess SG&A and then yen on the COG side.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Sure. Well, just to set the stage, there's two kinds of currency that we deal with. One is translation, which is converting local currencies, so France, euros into dollars, you convert the whole P&L. And since Europe is about 20% of our business, the translation currency relationship between the dollar and euro on translation usually hits at some point of the margin of that business. And so that is something that we\u2019ve dealt with year in and year out, as long as I've been -- since 1972 when we went off the gold standard. So every company deals with translation rates going back and forth and I don't think that's an issue for us. ", "Transaction currency, which is primarily transferring costs from one location to another, and in our case it would be yen to euro in Europe and also to the United States. The biggest change is the euro to the yen. The dollar hasn't changed that much. And we're going to manage this the same way that we managed when the same thing happened in the fourth quarter of 2008 and managed our way through 2009 with not really having a blip on gross profit margin. And the way we do that is, number one, we address it as a cost issue. So translation, transaction currency changes, your costs go up and you have to address it like you would any other cost increase. And so we have a lot of cost-reduction programs centered around it. Sourcing, suppliers, those kind of things are ways that you can manage those kind of costs. We do hedging, to some degree that helps us. We have a currency sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox that says that we don't take the whole brunt of any currency changes, so we\u2019re usually going after a smaller part of the currency change. ", "We have opportunities for pricing because, obviously, other of our competitors in Europe are getting product, then it's got to be higher costs for them also, so everybody has the same cost pressure. And I have a high confidence that we're going to be in our guidance range, not in spite of any kind of currency headwinds here. And I think we always give a balanced guidance view, which takes into consideration that we get some good things happening, some tougher things happening and we work through them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Can you talk a little bit about the install growth? It looked like the entry level was extremely strong, but I know there were easy comps, but it still looks very high. Can you talk about what's going on in the market, like Entry, Mid-range and the High-end and compare and contrast what was better than expected and what some of the trends are that show this install growth, which looked pretty impressive?", "Ursula Burns", "The Entry, the strength -- the unusual strength within the Entry segment and DMO and -- DMO small and medium business clients have the largest uses of this type of technology. DMO had a bang-up second quarter -- had a very, very strong first quarter, continued strength in the second quarter, very good therefore. I mean, it's almost as simple as that. No one else underperformed and DMO over performed. So that at Mid-range, we offered new products -- by the way, we offered new products across Entry, Mid-range and High-end, so new products helped in Entry as well. Mid-range we offered new products. We have our Color MFP, the ColorQube device, out in the marketplace and that's doing very well. We took the risk of launching it in the midst of the -- one of the worst recessions that we had in 2009, and that really has taken off, it's good. And we launched another set of color and black-and-white Mid-range devices, so strength there. And in the High-end, and particularly in color, we launched our product called the 800/1000, two configurations. We continue with the iGen, with our 700 -- with our 7002 to 8002. So we have a very strong product line in color at the High-end and the activity is coming in all geographies at the High-end, in all geographies at the Mid-range, as I said, and then primarily in DMO at the very low end.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "And so did the High-end grow in total when you add it all up or was\u2026", "Ursula Burns", "It sure did. It grew by 7%. And installs also grew. Installs grew in color and declined in black-and-white.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Yes, and when you net it together at the High-end?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, we grew.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Then moving away from that -- but one last thing on that is that what do you think this says about the imaging market? I mean, are we turning? Is it just easy compares, is this sustainable? What does it say about the printer market?", "Ursula Burns", "Well, I think -- so we have to acknowledge that the compares are easy, easier, I mean, to avoid that. But despite that, I think that there are a couple of things that are happening. As the economy starts to stabilize and improve a bit, people are starting to invest more in game-changing technology. And in some cases that's as simple as going from a black-and-white device to a color device. We are offering them a lot more choice in color, so they're making that -- they\u2019re making those decisions as the economy loosens up a bit for sure. If you look through the numbers, though, you\u2019ll see that black-and-white production continues to decline. I think that what -- that's another indicator that we're making this transition from color -- from black-and-white to color across -- basically across the board. So I think what it says is that this growth -- this strength that we saw, I don't expect to continue to be our norm for the rest of the quarters or even quarters into the future. This was a very, very strong quarter. But I do expect activity and particularly color activity to continue to grow in the years to come, just not at this rate.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "And then can you just discuss a little more about your government exposure? There seems to be a lot of confusion out there. What is the -- of the ACS you bought, to my understanding, it's about 40% government and there's a large state and local. If could you just talk about you bought, what the government exposure is, and then maybe what the combined Xerox looks like in terms of government exposure and differentiate between federal and state and local. I think there's a lot of confusion out there as to what your exposure is and how that's really going.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, we call it an opportunity, not an exposure. We get 40% of our ACS revenues are from governments, 35% is from state and local and 5% from the federal government. In our legacy business, we have about 20 -- a little bit more than 20%, 23% of our business is in government, about 20% in state and local, and about 5% in federal. So in total, we're about 25% in state and local, 5% in federal government. So that's  -- those are the facts of our mix. ", "If you look at what we provide to state and local governments, our Technology for sure, either Document Outsourcing or pure Technology contracts, but the big piece that we bought from ACS is in Medicaid, Medicare, customer care, transportation. It's in the lines of business, ITO, et cetera, that they\u2019re -- that they participate in. As I said in the talk part of my -- of the earlier sections, this is generally either federally mandated for states and locals, federally mandated programs, so unemployment , delivery of -- they do unemployment cards, Medicaid or Medicare delivery, education requirements, things that are required. That's one set of activity that's done. By the way, as I said, the signings and the pipeline and the revenue that we generate from this in quarter two, all strong. Pipeline is the highest that it's been since first quarter of 2009. So we are not seeing a massive like wind in our face in the government at all in the ACS section of the business, nor are we seeing it in the Document Outsourcing or Technology side of the business. So within ACS government business, as I said, single-level growth, mid-single digit growth in quarter two, bookings up at a very high rate and the pipeline is the largest that it's been. So the facts on the table are that we're not really seeing a big push in government. ", "Let me move it to Europe just quickly there. Similar type of mix of business. Some of that is in our Document Outsourcing business and a little bit and growing portion in ACS, similar type activities. We\u2019ve talked to you in the past about a Department of Works and Pension contract. I was just over to BWP earlier in the year and the requests from them is similar that we get from everyone. First, help us save money, please. Help us be more efficient in front of our clients because we have more and more of them in front of us. The more using our services, we have to become more efficient and more effective in the way that we talk and we have to be cost effective. So they're speaking to us about not getting away from them, but please help us automate and save money, make more customer friendly and save money, et cetera, et cetera. Some of them are saying, I need to save money, just plain and simple. So what we do there is do more services under the guise of the contract. And in some conversations we have about extending contracts such that we can actually lock in a revenue stream going forward and get some cost concessions for them in the near term. Net-net we balance this fairly well. We balance it to the point where we actually can feel very comfortable about our position in both state and local and federal governments around the world.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Just finally, any pricing pressure out there in the copier/printer market? There\u2019s some thesis out there that pricing\u2019s going to get really bad when HP gets more product. We're not seeing it yet. I was wondering if you are.", "Ursula Burns", "We are not. What we\u2019ve seen, pricing 5% to 10%, and it's now -- it's actually tending toward the lower end of that range in quarter two. I would expect that we have -- that if there is price pressure by any single competitor, we'll do as we always do. We try to win in the marketplace and -- win in the marketplace and provide the value. And I think two other additional points. One is that everybody's going to feel the pressure if there is cost increases based on transaction currency.  So I don't know what -- we're expecting the cost to go up, so we're actually managing to not put too much pressure negatively on price, so not to bring price down. And in the last...", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Hard to cut price with the strong yen and the weak euro, right?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, exactly. And then the last piece is that we have a little bit of different model than HP. HP has a printer-based model and we have a multi-function model. And multi-function means add a whole bunch of things together, put it in one device and become more efficient, more cost effective, et cetera. So our value proposition is better in this market and a market under pressure than HP\u2019s is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Hey, Ursula, I was wondering if you could just talk about uses trends as you saw them through the quarter. They seem to have improved last quarter and just wondering if you saw the same kind of improvement or if things just sort of held steady there?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, so I think that we've seen an improving trend quarter-to-quarter and a similar trend therefore. So color, in just about every segment, think about it, has gone -- has improved. So color pages are up 9%, color mix is up, color is up. Color is up, that's good. Black-and-white, particularly in the Core business, the Core Office segment of the business, that's very High-end. Black-and-white is up as well. So we've seen strength in black-and-white, particularly -- all segments except for the very High-end have improved. The very High-end, so what we call High-end production in printing, I think, whatever it's called  -- High-end production printing is under pressure and that pressure continues. It started in the end of 2008 and it continues. We're pushing a lot of that continuance. As we get more and better color offerings, the 800 and the 1000, for example, we move -- we push to move pages from black-and-white to color. So we expect to see that portion of the business continue under pressure. By the way, we're not going to give it away, because it's a big piece of our business. Very, very profitable and customers still do need it. But we don't expect to see growth there. We expect to see growth from color and we're seeing it.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "In the High-end business, is there I guess any difference in the trend you're seeing, I would say from your kind of -- I guess your Production business, the portion that goes to the graphic arts versus the portion that goes into kind of enterprise environments and how production centers, whether it be placements or usage of placements?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, it has nothing spectacular, but I am more than hopeful, I'm fairly confident that we'll start to see movement, especially in the graphic arts segment of the business. The question is how you capture that movement, what offerings, what special business development tools that you give them to move their business along. I talk about photo books and packaging applications, which is a portion of this graphic arts business. That's where we're focusing our investments. And we're doing that because we know that there\u2019s a change a\u2019coming, as they would say. There is a need to automate their business and there is money there. So we're helping the graphic arts customers to do that with technology, but we're also offering draft around it. But net-net quarter one to quarter two, we've seen not significant improvement in or change in graphic arts or in enterprise.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Anything -- I believe the comment last quarter was things enterprise, commercial enterprise, they\u2019re a little bit more stable-ish. Obviously you're seeing some deals get done that weren't getting done, maybe second half of last year. It seems like the install trends are about the same. Are you seeing any change in the content? Are the reasons that the -- the reasons the installs are getting done, are you seeing any net new projects getting done or is it sort of still the same,  sort of the release of stuff that was on hold coming out of last year?", "Ursula Burns", "I'll offer it to two -- answer it in two segments and then we'll move on to the next question. ", "First from a Technology side of our business, we're seeing upticks in certain geographies that we saw traction already in certain segments of the business. But in the other place that we saw kind of amazing -- very solid growth was in High-end color and that's, I think, almost solely because we gave out -- because we offered two great products to the marketplace, the 800 and 1000. Significant traction there, not only in that product, but also because we have those products and people coming in looking to us and we're selling other products as well. In the Services side, as I said, we had amazing -- very strong revenue, very strong signings, very strong pipeline and that's because we have very strong offerings. And we have amazing coverage. The combination of ACS and Xerox together has made the value proposition that we offer significantly more compelling, and we are definitely seeing the benefit of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "You mentioned what signings were over the latest 12 months of plus 12%. Did you characterize what the signings were for the quarter on a year-over-year basis?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, we can. The signings for the -- we don't really give you specifics on the quarter, but we say that -- I can tell you that they are stronger -- that they are strong. Strong. I would not put very in front of it, but they\u2019re strong.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "So lower than the latest 12 months scenario of 12%?", "Ursula Burns", "No, no, no. They're very high -- they\u2019re much higher than the trailing 12 months, which you would expect them to be, because the trailing 12 months -- and that's the reason why we give trailing 12 months, because there's spikes, up and down some days, sometimes higher, sometimes lower. This quarter, quarter two, the signings in that quarter for the next -- for the 12 months to come is about $2.5 billion. So but signings overall, signings in the quarter were stronger than the trailing 12 month and it's very good. ", "And one other thing about signings, if I may, we talk about signings growth, Services pipeline growth --and Services pipeline growth is about 23%. That bodes well because in the next -- the next time I speak to you, you'll have those pipelines -- some portion of that pipeline into signings. And then the next time I speak to you, you'll have some portion of those signings into Revenue. So it actually is a good way that it grows across the market, yes.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "On the OpEx, Larry, I was hoping -- could you give us some color on what OpEx in total, both R&D and SAG, will do sequentially in the September quarter?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well, I mean it depends on currency. I mean, I don't see significant changes going forward.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Yes, let's hold currency constant at today's spot. Does that mean that OpEx -- excuse me, R&D is actually flat?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "R&D, I think, you'll see improvements going forward to some degree. They're small. And I think generally speaking, SAG will be flat or with a slight growth, but it won't be a dramatic change.", "Ursula Burns", "Keith, let me just do one thing. If you go to Slide 7, it\u2019ll show you the signings for our BPO business, our ITO business and our Document Outsourcing business is about $4.2 billion, which is over the quarter one signings for about $3.9 billion. So sequentially, we see signings growth. And if you look at the last 12, the trailing 12 months\u2019 growth, it's about 12%, so versus 5% in the first quarter. So we're seeing growth across the business line, we're seeing growth in both signings for the forward and signings for the trailing. So it\u2019s growth across every way that I can actually speak to you about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Ursula, there's been a lot of discussion around the state and local government on the call. I wanted to follow up on the earlier question and ask what is your assessment of the -- I guess the strength of the pipeline in state and local government now versus say six to 12 months ago? And I understand that most of that's federally mandated, a lot of it's federally mandated and the bookings are strong, but is there a risk that those customers can come back a year or two before a contract comes up for renewal and ask for pricing concessions, and therefore put some pressure on the pricing and margins for existing contracts?", "Ursula Burns", "So as I said a little bit earlier, Richard, our pipeline in the quarter is the highest that it's been since quarter one of 2009, so\u2026", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Particularly for state and local governments?", "Ursula Burns", "For state and local. It is the strongest pipeline that we've had in -- since we've seen the company and since we've had the company, which hasn't been that long, but since we've been looking at it. Pipeline is strong, the signings are strong and the current business is strong. Is there a risk or chance or that people can come back and ask for price concessions? In all of our business is that risk or chance. I mean, everywhere we have it. Are we seeing it? The answer is no. Are we having conversations? The answer is yes, every day with our clients. We understand. Sometimes we initiate those conversations because we understand exactly how much pressure states are under. So the way that we manage this business is not to wait for them to call us and say, my goodness, I need more help. We actually go out continuously and offer them more help. Sometimes that help is extend a contract. You extend the contract, we\u2019ll give you some price concessions. That saves us a significant amount of time and money in the long run, so we'll do that kind of thing. Or we'll add more to the service that we're providing them. A lot of that is for some form of money, obviously. The more they need, they need more efficiency. So the conversations are there. They are definitely happening, and some of them, I'm sure, will result in us having to change the terms and conditions or the game or the contract. But that's not the norm here, not by any stretch of the imagination. Even in ACS's past, in our past, and in ACS\u2019s present with us, and neither -- we're not seeing that either as a norm.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "And then I wanted to go back to the install strength as well, and I know that you specifically mentioned DMO and SMB. And in DMO in particular, do you think that this is just reflective of a typical cyclical rebound in those markets and strong end-market growth in DMO, or do you feel like you're actually gaining a significant amount of market share in DMO?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, we're gaining market share in DMO. There's no doubt about that. But there is a level of cyclicality in this business, I mean, no doubt -- meaning DMO is improving and last year -- a couple of years ago, they were not. But we\u2019re doing because the market is more buoyant in DMO. But in addition to that, we\u2019re just not rising with the tide, we're definitely rising above the tide, especially in low-end MFPs and color. Just think about color, if you think about color growth then you can -- just about every line that we're doing business in up through the High-end we're gaining in share.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "And then I guess a skeptical analyst, within the SMB area, I think some people might say that you're benefiting currently from the supply constraints of one of your major competitors there. And I'm just interested to get your assessment of whether you feel like that is a material benefit to your SMB momentum right now or whether you just simply feel like the increased distribution with Global Imaging is the primary driver there?", "Ursula Burns", "I see absolutely no benefit that we're getting from supply constraints from our competitor, none. All of our benefits -- and this is as firm as I can be on a phone call, all of our benefit is because we have a great product line and we have great distribution, period.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "I actually wanted to follow up on Richard's question, more on the renewal side or rescoping side. Can you give any color on the bookings you're seeing in the pipeline that you see? How much of that represents new customers or new bookings versus renewals and extensions of existing contracts?", "Ursula Burns", "Right. The pipeline is 100% new. The way that we\u2019ve talked to you about pipeline is new customers. Renewals for -- in our business are strong. We are -- this is probably the highest renewal quarter that we\u2019ve had ever in ACS, and we\u2019ve -- not even us, but ACS has. We're at the high end of the 85% to 90% renewal range. We\u2019re at the high end of that. So think up a number that will be at the higher end of that and maybe a little bit before -- maybe a little bit above. So renewals are phenomenal. ", "Last quarter, we had a great signings quarter, new business signings quarter. That's a little bit softer this quarter. Renewals are significantly stronger this quarter and the pipeline is strong, as I said, up 23% and the pipeline is 100% new. There's no renewals in the pipeline.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "So if I understand that correctly, the new signings have moderated a little bit, but renewals have increased. Why do you think that is?", "Ursula Burns", "Well, I mean, one of the things that we\u2019ve focused on, making sure that we have bedded all of our contracts that's coming up. So we\u2019ve focus on -- we have a big book of business and we have to make sure that we bed down. That's the only reason, it's not really anything else. So the big energy here and the big thing that you should focus on here is the pipeline. And you\u2019ve hit on it before. We were up 23%, the pipeline is up 23%, it is the strongest pipeline that we've ever had. And that pipeline is varied across all of our lines of business. And so we\u2019re -- and the pipeline is not yet all signed, obviously, or else it would be in the signings. But we don't put it in the pipeline unless it's a real deal that we can get, a real, real deal that we can get. So we are very pleased with the pipeline. And if you remember on signings, we signed the California Medicaid bid. That's a $1.6 billion contract that we signed in quarter one. And so quarter-over-quarter, it's hard to replace the California Medicaid, so signings -- new business signings are a little bit light because we had $1.6 billion signing in quarter one.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "Question for you Larry on the guidance increase. I'm just trying to understand how much of the guidance increase is related to upside on the margins versus the top line. You didn't talk much about top line guidance for this year.", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well, we normally -- there's only so many lines that you're going to give guidance on. And so we're confident of 88% to 92%. And I think when we get the actual, we'll know exactly where we got them.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "The $22 billion that you've targeted previously, is it fair to say you're expecting some upside to that?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Yes, I'm not sure I would say that. I mean, you have currency that affects it, you have mix characteristics that affect it. It's a big number to point to so\u2026", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "Last one for me. On the cost cutting, are the synergies, the 100 to 150, are we now shading the high end of that range?", "Ursula Burns", "We're shading above 100. I think that's the best way to categorize it. So we're above 100, and we're running towards 150.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I want to come back to the ACS update in terms of the 10 signings to date, 10 plus signings. How much of those are competitive displacement versus placement of some home-grown type of processes? And then the second kind of correlative question or part of that question is, were these wins that were kind of predicated on bidding processes that took place after ACS closed? Or were they kind of relationship sourced, initiated months or even years ago?", "Ursula Burns", "I\u2019ll take both and Larry can feather in whatever he needs to. As far as how many of the 10 plus are competitive, I actually don't know the numbers exactly, but I can tell you the flavor of the way this business works a bit. A lot of what we compete against are processes the customer has already in place. So it's not a competitor in there doing something, it's they\u2019re -- they're doing it themselves, so we're taking over their customer care or with their HR process or financial and accounting processes. So in general, that's the kind of business that ACS does. Most of the market is under-penetrated. So I don't really know exactly the number, the 10 plus, how they break out. But in general, you would see that most of them break out that we're displacing somebody's own home-grown process. ", "As far as bidding process goes, some of these -- and this will be the same going forward as well -- is the expansion of a set of services in a client that we already do business with. So we do business with -- I'll use Procter & Gamble, even though they're not one of the -- may not be one of the 10. We do business with Procter & Gamble in customer care and then we take over their health -- HR outsourcing business. Some of it is that and that's not generally a bid. So we generally don't bid for that, we generally prove ourselves and expand our business there. Sometimes -- and some of these I am sure are bids as well. But I don't know the breakdown specifically, but the flavor of the business goes that way.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "As far as the install activity, getting back to the earlier question, I just want to get a sense in terms of the distribution or composition of the installed growth and across High-end, Mid-range, what have you. How should we think about the post-sale benefit a year from now? Would there be any sort of disruption to the trend line because of entry level being a bigger part of that mix? And will post sale be maybe a lighter relative growth a year from now? I know it's kind of hard to put the crystal ball together, but just trying to get a sense of the composition a little more", "Ursula Burns", "So the post sale from these -- from this install growth, this activity growth, obviously, it has a positive impact on post sale. But you are right to look at the entry level as a different type of install than the high. So you can't correlate -- you shouldn't correlate that high-entry growth to a significant wholesale growth. So it\u2019ll grow because we have a lot more devices out there. High-end is more impactful in the post sale than low. But I tell you what, this trend, this big movement in number of machines that we put in place and the high penetration of color devices, will help for sure as they get in and start getting used. There is no -- this is all positive news from a post-sale perspective.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I have one question for Larry, actually, if I could, real quickly. Larry, just given the strong performance of the cash flow for the first half of the year and given how the second half historically has always seen an outsized performance versus the first half from a cash flow perspective, just trying to get a sense, do you have a little more flexibility in terms of maybe not having to throttle forward as heavy on the working capital efficiencies that you talked about earlier this year? Do you have any more wiggle room or could we see upside if you keep throttling forward?", "Lawrence Zimmerman", "Well, our goal is -- I mean, when it comes to setting a target for cash flow, we want to do well in every line. We want to do well on working capital, so that's how we work it. So we look at the inventory by itself and we look at what we think is a competitive inventory to have and hopefully that yields us more than our goal. If you look at last year, we blew the doors off on AR and inventory in the fourth quarter. I think we -- in the first two quarters of this year, we haven't really capitalized on those two. I think we will in the second half. And it\u2019s -- I'm not -- I don't have the goal of 2.6 that stops me from working on working capital. So I hope that answers your question.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Douglas Ireland with JMP Securities.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "I was wondering, the ITO signings are up 125% and I was wondering if that is where you're seeing a lot of your cross selling success, is there any way to\u2026", "Ursula Burns", "I don't think ITO signings were up 125%. We're trying to dig through it right now to find out...", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "I'm looking quarter-over-quarter, sorry.", "Ursula Burns", "Oh, quarter-over-quarter, I don\u2019t -- ITO signings are a small number, you can't -- in the quarter, so you can't read it's $500 million. So you can't read a lot into it. So say your question one more time.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "I was just wondering if -- I'm trying to really get a line on where you're having success in the cross selling. I'm very interested in how that's playing out, so I\u2019m looking for signs of where you're successful there.", "Ursula Burns", "So ITO signings are up, but so are Business, BPO and Document Outsourcing. You can\u2019t -- we shouldn't read into the fact that the ITO signings were up as that\u2019s the major driver. Signings were up because every portion of the Business line, including Document Outsourcing, signings are up as well. So the mix is good. The mix of the Business lines in BPO and the mix of adding an ITO and Document Outsourcing is good.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "And is there also a Technology pull-through?", "Ursula Burns", "On the ITO piece in particular, there would be a pretty big Technology pull-through. But I'll give you an example of a Technology pull-through from a BPO signing that we had. We signed California Medicaid last quarter, and when we signed California, it's a $1.6 billion signing, one of the portions of California Medicaid was technology to support the BPO outsourcing and that technology was not Xerox technology. And one of the synergies -- we don't count it in the synergy number. One of the synergies that we will benefit from is to remove all of the technology that's not Xerox and replace it all with Xerox. We've already gotten that approval and we're in the process of doing [ph] (1:11:24) that in the California Medicaid contract. It doesn't add revenue to us, right, because $1.6 billion is $1.6 billion. But think about the gross profit and the profit benefit that we get from this additional ability to use Xerox\u2019s technology in a BPO contract that you cross sell, but we didn't cross sell, we cross implemented. It\u2019s that way. So we're seeing cross selling. ITO pulls management services for sure, BPOs pull Technology, our Technology pulls the BPO offerings in ITO. So we're cross selling in just about every way. $2.5 billion of pipeline from the synergy perspective comes from that, comes from the fact that we're bringing each other in and showing our wares to each other's client.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "And then looks like the post-sale revenue was just slightly down quarter-over-quarter. Is that seasonal? Is it affected by the price increase that happened at the end of the last quarter?", "Ursula Burns", "You hit it right on the nose.  Now that\u2019s  -- the driver for that is -- and we did -- be aware of this, we had a very good supply pull-through because of the price increase and then we would actually normalize in this quarter, and we have done that. So I think it's a little bit more normal.

First Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.

Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. Our results in the quarter reflect progress in scaling our Services business, while maintaining our leadership in document technology.", "Steady revenue growth and our sharp focus on operational improvements resulted in a 28% increase in adjusted earnings. This is the last quarter that we need to report on a pro forma basis. You'll recall that we closed on the ACS acquisition in February of 2010.  So going forward, we have the benefit of a full year of ACS results in our year-over-year comparison.", "Our first quarter pro forma revenue increased 2%. We delivered Q1 adjusted EPS of $0.23, which was above our guidance. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.19 per share. This includes $0.04 from the amortization of intangibles.", "Cost and expense management remains a strength of ours, leading to a Q1 operating margin of 9.1%, a year-over-year improvement of close to 1 point. Gross margin of 33% is within our range and reflects the results of more revenue coming from services and the continued impact of currency.", "The first quarter is typically our lightest in the year for cash generation. Due to some seasonal effects of our business on working capital and the timing of accounts payable, we used $30 million in operating cash during the first quarter. We remain very confident in our cash flow for the balance of the year and continue to expect to deliver $2.5 billion in operating cash and $1.9 billion of free cash flow for the full year.", "Our CFO, Luca Maestri, will provide more detail on cash flow and our financials in a moment. First, I'll review a summary of our Q1 performance and discuss how we're managing the impact on our business from the earthquake in Japan, then Luca and I will both take your questions. ", "So let's turn to Slide 4. In the past year, we transformed not only our business into a leading player in the services base but also our business model with growth largely driven from an increasing annuity stream. 85% of our total revenue comes from annuity, and annuity was up 3% in Q1 or 2% in constant currency. Total revenue of nearly $5.5 billion was up 15%. On a pro forma basis, it was up 2% in constant currency.", "Equipment sales were flat in the quarter. This was not surprising considering the double-digit growth rates we saw in Q1 of last year as the economy was improving, especially in developing markets, fast for the year and we're facing volatility in some Middle Eastern markets, stalling previous rapid growth in this region. With a series of recent product launches and more to come in Q2, we expect to see an improvement in equipment sales later this year. For now, we're being prudent in our planning considering potential product constraints from Japan. I'll talk more about this in a moment.", "First, let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of the metrics that fuel our annuity: pages, MIF and signings. In our Technology business, we focus on color page growth and machines in the field, or MIF. Many of you that I always know that I always provide a reminder of this equation: More MIF leads to more pages; more pages, especially Color pages, generate more revenue from supplies and technical service; MIF plus pages equals more revenue flowing through to our annuity stream.", "For Q1, we saw continued growth in MIF, with Digital up 2% and Color MIF up 14%. Color is 32% of our MIF and 25% of pages. Total Digital pages were down  5%, the result of declines in transactional black-and-white pages. Yet within total pages, we had a 7% increase in higher value Color pages. We're focusing our investments on creating more Color pages through affordable, office color printing and more advanced digital production printing.", "As important, we continue to grow our distribution network, including 4 recent acquisitions that expand our assets to small and mid-sized businesses. 3 are in the U.S. and 1 in the U.K. In our Services business, Signings totaled $3 billion and were up 3% on a trailing 12-month basis. Keep in mind that the trailing 12-month and year-over-year compares can easily be skewed by big deals. That's the nature of ", "a services business and was the case this quarter. ", "In Q1 of 2010, you recall that we signed the $1.6 billion 10-year California Medicaid contract. The size and duration of the deal creates a tough compare for this year.", "That said, I am very pleased with the success of our Signings this quarter. It's $3 billion of revenue that benefits us over the length of multi-year contracts. And many of the wins were the result of cross-selling with ACS.", "Notable deals in the quarter include a $200 million contract to manage IT services for MGM Resorts International, reducing document devices from 2,700 to less than 900 through managed print services for the workforce provider, Kelly Services. ", "Managing clinical and technology applications for clients who use Allscripts for most hosting services. Since Allscripts is the most used solution for electronic health records, this is a significant deal, valued at $500 million over the next 10 years and reflects increasing demand from healthcare providers for IT support.", "In addition, we're continuing to win government contracts for transaction and claims processing as well as transportation and parking services. Our growth in Services was driven by an 8% increase in revenue from our BPO offering, 4% from Document Outsourcing and 1% from ITO. That's strong performance across the board, along with a 29% increase in our total pipeline.", "We're also scaling our Services business through acquisitions. In Q1, we announced an expansion of our call center business in Europe by acquiring Unamic. And through our acquisition of CredenceHealth, we're strengthening our portfolio of software solutions that serve the healthcare market. ", "In summary, our progress in Services and Technology reflects our differentiation in the marketplace and the benefits of our diverse portfolio. We continue to hold the #1 revenue market share position for document technology and the breadth of our services offerings as well as our global account relationships give us a competitive advantage. So it was a good start to the year.", "Before I hand it over to Luca, let's turn to Slide 6 for a review on how we're responding to and impacted by the tragic events in Japan. Most important, we are relieved to learn that our people, the Xerox employees in Japan and our colleagues from Fuji Xerox, are all safe. And since Fuji Xerox's major manufacturing and operations sites are in Tokyo and regions south and west from where the earthquake hit the hardest, our facilities were not damaged.", "We do business with a number of other partners and vendors in Japan, and we're working with them on a daily basis to comprehend the impact on our supply chain. Our #1 priority is fulfilling customer orders and maintaining the uptime of their Xerox systems. That means alternative sourcing for components and materials often at a higher cost, and it means more expensive distribution methods like airfreight to avoid the long delays in many ports. As a result, we're seeing increased supply chain costs, but we are focused first on our customer needs. ", "Our employees in Japan and our colleagues in Fuji Xerox are doing an incredible job managing the complexities of this very challenging situation. We were extremely grateful for their perseverance and tremendous support. Based on our analysis of the situation, we expect to see some product constraints toward the middle of the second quarter, impacting the pace of install for Xerox and Fuji Xerox. And we don't expect to see a full recovery until later this year.", "So from a financial perspective, there are potential Q2 headwinds in 3 areas: Equity income from our 25% ownership of Fuji Xerox; supply chain costs; and equipment sale revenue due to possible product constraints. Considering there is still much uncertainty, we're providing a broader range than usual for our earnings expectations in the second quarter. We expect that over the course of the year, we will minimize the impact on cost and revenue. ", "Therefore, we remain fully committed to delivering on our full year expectations. We maintain a 24/7 focus on managing the situation in Japan, and I do feel that we're in a better position than most. Above all, we're doing what we can to help our colleagues in Japan recover and rebuild. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. As Ursula said, we are reasonably pleased with the overall results for the quarter and continue to see opportunity for further improvement ahead of us.", "Revenue growth on a pro forma basis was 2% in Q1, which was good performance but under our full year range of 3% to 5%. We expect to accelerate revenue growth as we move through the year because of our significant signings in 2010 and as we begin to realize greater synergy revenues. Therefore, we remain confident in our ability to be in the 3% to 5% range for the full year.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 9.1%, up nearly a point year-on-year on a pro forma basis and a very good start for the year. As anticipated, we saw currency and the mix of business impacting gross margin.  But this impact was more than offset by disciplined expense management. Our RD&E and SAG ratios improved quite significantly, thanks to restructuring and synergies and we're well on track for a full year objectives of $270 million of restructuring savings and over $120 million of cost synergies.", "On the gross margin front, we expect improvement over the year where we continue to implement restructuring and synergy initiatives, and we see now reduced headwind from currency. ", "Equity income in the quarter was $34 million, which reflected a strong year end for Fuji Xerox. The $34 million includes $11 million in Fuji Xerox restructuring, which we did not adjust out this year. Adjusted EPS was $0.23 and grew 28% year-on-year. The only adjustment to reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles, and GAAP EPS of $0.19 was an improvement of $0.23 year-on-year.", "As Ursula indicated, going forward, we expect equity income to be affected by the events in Japan, especially during Q2 and Q3. We also continue to assess the direct impact on our operations, and we'll provide an update on this during our investor conference in May. As a result of the uncertainty from Japan, we are providing a range for Q2 EPS, which is wider than usual. ", "Let us turn now to Slide 8 for a review of our segments, starting with technology. Technology revenue was flat in Q1 at $2.5 billion, about 46% of our business. Importantly, segment margin of 10.7% was up over a point year-on-year with benefits from restructuring more than offsetting the negative impact from currency.", "Overall, good performance despite some headwinds in the entry category caused by lower installs and equipment revenue. Entry for performance is weighted heavily towards the developing markets. The results in Q1 were in part affected by disruption in the Middle East. Looking forward, we anticipate trends to improve although Q2 will face a difficult compare given the 56% install growth that we had during Q2 of 2010. On the product side, we are in the midst of a refresh of our lower end, multi-function product lines, which we expect will have entry performance.", "Mid-range continues to show very good growth, thanks to a strong Color portfolio, which delivers industry-leading quality, productivity and price value. The product line will also be strengthened by new product announcements in Q2. In high-end, the Color Press 800/1000 continues to perform well and is the driver of our Color install growth. As we go through the year, we will have more product launches such as the already announced inkjet production system that will build up on our leadership in the segment.", "In summary, solid overall performance in Technology during Q1, and we expect this will continue throughout the year.", "Moving on to Services on Page 9. Services revenue was up 40%, or 5% on a pro forma basis. Growth was driven by BPO, which was up 8%, and Document Outsourcing, up 4%, with good sequential improvement. ITO revenue was up 1%.", "BPO's 8% growth had strong contributions from HR services, from customer care volumes and new business ramping transportation. This growth more than offset declines in government services associated with lower unemployment claims volume and contract run-off.", "BPO signings were $1.25 billion with good momentum across all lines of business. ITO had very strong signings, which more than doubled year-on-year, and also had strong pipeline growth. We expect this positive trend in ITO to continue as new contracts ramp during the year. Document Outsourcing also had a very good quarter with strong signings up 42% year-on-year in addition to the revenue growth of 4%.", "Overall, signings grew 3% on a trailing 12-month basis, which represents a deceleration given the 10-year $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal that we signed in Q1 of last year. In total, our Services pipeline was up 29%, including synergies. Segment margin of 10.3% was up 7/10 of a point and reflected the positive contribution from restructuring and synergy savings.", "In summary, positive results in both our Technology and Services segments.", "With that, let us move to the cash flow slide on Page 10. Cash from operations is seasonally weakest for us in Q1. And this quarter was further impacted by the timing of accounts payable. The accounts payable timing will work itself out through the year, and we remain committed to achieve $2.5 billion in operating cash flow for the year. Earnings contributed $289 million to cash flow, a strong performance but not enough to offset working capital usage of $584 million. ", "Let me make a few comments on working capital. The accounts receivable movement is in line with prior Q1 performance and reflects the tremendous effort that is made each Q4 to drive collections. DSOs actually improved year-on-year, reflecting our focus on cash generation. Inventory performance is also in line with our expectations and reflects the building back of inventory after the high Q4 sales period.", "Accounts payable was a greater use of cash than normal but broadly expected given our seasonal timing of payments. CapEx was $111 million for the quarter, and we're well positioned relative to our full year outlook of $600 million. That was flat for the quarter, and our cash balance was $1 billion. ", "Slide 11 provides more detail on our debt and cash flow expectations, beginning with debt. Given our borrowing capacity and our objective to optimize funding costs, we intend to call our 2027 trust preferred securities during the second quarter. These preferred securities were issued in 1997 have a par value at $650 million and carry an 8% coupon. This action will help reduce interest expense and will be cash accretive by the end of 2011.", "In our second quarter, we expect to report a $34 million pretax charge as a discreet item, which represents $24 million of non-cash, carrying value adjustments and a $10 million cash premium.", "We are raising our year-end debt target by $650 million, the face amount of this security to $8.6 billion. Just to be clear, through this transaction, our liabilities remain unchanged and this action has no impact on the level of available cash or on the timing of cash deployment. We also remain committed to maintaining a solid investment-grade rating.", "When looking at our debt balances, it is always important to keep in mind that the vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing business. We have $8.6 billion of debt of which $6.3 billion can be associated to the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers which assumes a 7 to 1 leverage of our finance assets of $7.2 billion. These finance assets represent a committed revenue stream from our customers.", "As I've said before, we remain confident in our achievement of cash from operations of $2.5 billion, and we expect to have $1 billion to $1.2 billion of available cash of this year.  We are fully committed to using over 70% of available cash towards share repurchases beginning in the second half.", "In summary, we had a solid quarter in spite of some fairly challenging external circumstances. Our annuity base business model and our market leadership position are strong assets, which we would continue to leverage to grow earnings and return value to shareholders. ", "Back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. ", "We're a full year into our acquisition of ACS and fully realizing the benefits of being the world's  largest enterprise for business process and document management. We continue to expand our offerings through products and services that give our clients more flexible choices and give us a competitive advantage while strengthening our annuity stream.", "We continue to expand our distribution channels, reaching more and more customers, especially small and mid-sized businesses, on a global basis. And we continue to operate our business effectively and efficiently, helping to offset margin pressures from revenue mix and currency.", "As a result, in Q1, adjusted EPS increased 28%. Revenue was up, and we improved operating margins. Generating significant cash flow is imperative to our business and a key focus for our leadership team. This year we expect $1 billion to $1.2 billion in available cash for acquisitions and to buy back stock.", "For the second quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.23 to $0.26 per share, and we remain committed to delivering full year adjusted earnings of $1.05 to $1.10 per share. ", "With that, I thank you again for joining us today. And now let's open it up to your questions for Luca and me.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Can you just talk a bit about what you're seeing in terms of page trends? Actually, sort of end usage at customers? Because you had page volume that was down 5%. You had document outsourcing was up 4%. So I'm kind of curious as to sort of what you think everything that's out  in terms of what customers are doing and their willingness to print? And then I have a couple of follow-ups?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I think that what we're seeing from page trends is the continuation of the trends that we saw in the beginning all through 2010 and 2009. So with a little bit of a hiccup in this quarter driven a little bit by the Middle East. So this is what is happening. In black-and-white, particularly high-end production pages, we continue to see a decline of those pages. That's pretty much what we expect, and it's kind of in our business model and our business thinking today. That decline has not significantly accelerated but it is definitely continuing. It's a big piece of our page volume. At the same time, seeing a pickup, an increase in color pages and we're seeing an increase in average price per page because as we mix towards color, the price per page actually trends upwards, which is good. We're seeing an increased importance of the low end of our business, so the printing trends in small and medium mid-sized businesses. And we're responding to that by increasing our product intensity there and our distribution there, primarily through acquisitions. And so -- and then overriding that, we had a pretty big stall in activity and therefore, in pages in the Middle East, which we expect to come back as that region settles down, which it is beginning to do. So as we work our way through 2011, we'll see continued growth in color, continued growth in average price per page, a decline in high-end black-and-white pages and a stabilization in the growth in the low end pages, which will bring our trends pretty much in line with what we expect them to be.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay, great. And then, Ursula, if you could talk a little bit about geographic trends in terms of demand, what you're seeing in the various regions? And any color you can shed on, sort of what Fuji Xerox has seen in terms of demand in Japan? I know it's a tough situation right now. But is it sort of -- is some business getting back to normal? Or just how should we sort of think about that and also Europe and some of the other regions?", "Ursula Burns", "Let me start with the other regions and I'll end with Japan. In the developing markets, which was a high-growth area for us, it remains a growth area for us. We, as you know, had difficulty. We and everybody else had difficulty in the Middle East area. It's a pretty big -- it's a good area for us. We're strong there. We have high share there, and we were impacted by the downturn. We didn't lose position in that marketplace. So as their economy improves, we'll participate in that area, so no problems there. From the DMO perspective as well as developing markets, Russia is a big area for us and we had huge growth in Russia in 2010, end of 2009. And we're seeing that this quarter actually slow a little bit, but we don't expect that to be a continuous trend. I think that DMO, excluding the Middle East, will continue to be a growth area for us, so pretty good. Those territories are pretty good. Europe, we talked to you before about Europe responding better than the headlines would anticipate that they would respond. So our position in Europe from a market share perspective, the penetration of color products, from our services penetration, the winning of deals, all that is very good. Europe as you know is a lower margin region for us and we're focused on continuing to win across-the-board technology and services and continuing to focus on our cost and expense in that area so that we can have a continued good business model, but Europe is strong. U.S., I have to say, has a little bit better output than it had in the previous quarters. Our equipment sales revenue in the United States is definitely picking up across the board. We're strengthening in all segments, primarily driven by the fact that we have increased penetration in performance in the low end of the business and we continue our strength in the high-end, particularly at color. We do have a product gap right below the very high-end in color, right above the mid and in color that we will fill in the second half of the year that should help us to even turn that around a bit, particularly on the post-sales side. But U.S., better than it was in the past, still a little bit tepid but improving for us. Japan, it's hard to tell, Shannon. And I'm not trying to be evasive at all. We are in constant contact. When I say constant, it's like annoyingly constant, you probably saw the people in Japan. With them on how they are doing. And their transparency is cloudy, so our transparency is cloudy as well. What I can say is that our post-sale stream, which is very important, it is 85% of the total revenue, and on the equipment side, 70% plus of the revenue. That is not impacted at all. The first thing that we focus on is to make sure that we can get that supply stream assured so that we don't have any customers who've already bought the technology down or waiting for us. We have that pretty well secured in both Japan and in the U.S. The part that was affected for Fuji Xerox was at a high business area for them or for anybody it seems like at all. The big issues are how they supply to the rest of Japan and to the rest of the United States and the rest of the world, particularly the United States. So in Japan, we're seeing not a lot of transparency. We were able get through the first quarter well, both Xerox, Fuji Xerox. We're pretty sure we'll be able to get through for equipment the first half of the second quarter. We think we'll have some problems in the second half of the second quarter. But we're also pretty confident that we'll be able to work through those throughout the year. So without having detailed transparency to all that's happening in Fuji Xerox, I'm confident that we'll be able to manage it on a Xerox income perspective. Fuji Xerox, it depends. I think that they're coming up. They're doing okay. They're dealing with that rolling power outages, all of these things kind of contribute to the uncertainty. But if they perform, which we expect that they will like they did in the first quarter, our first quarter, we will be able to make it through the first to the rest of the year, I think, without any hiccup on an overall basis from a year perspective. And if  you think about what happened there, it's kind of an amazing statement. As I said when I was speaking earlier, I think that we are definitely better positioned than most. I'm pretty sure of that even though we haven't seen what the other Japanese competitors or manufacturers are saying about their results.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Great. Yes, I think next week will be interesting, when Canada and others report, so thank you. And then, Luca, if you could possibly just talk about sort of your initial thoughts on what you've seen at Xerox, opportunities, I mean you've been there a few months now. It would be great to get your take on it.", "Luca Maestri", "Sure. I think probably the word that summarizes my thoughts is execution. When I look at some of the commitments that we've made, when we need to execute on those commitments from an operational standpoint, we are in the midst of a large restructuring program, which we have announced but we need to execute now. We are doing a very important synergy activity with the combination of ACS and Xerox and both on the revenue and on the cost side. And we've got a number of new products that we need to launch on costs, on time, on quality. And then we've got a lot of financial commitments, right? We've talked about EPS growth. We've talked about cash generation. We've talked about debt repayment and of course the share buyback, right? And those are commitments that we are fully committed, too, and we will execute again. And then from an overall business perspective, when you look a bit longer term, the key for us is revenue growth and it needs to be profitable. And that's why we're so focused on this revenue opportunities that we've got with the combination of Xerox and ACS. And then that's why we continue to be focused on acquisitions. And that's why we continue to be focused on refreshing our product portfolio. And international growth is important for us, and that's why we are focusing on places where traditionally we're not as focused as we are today.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Just two pretty important things I want to clear up. Last quarter, on your slide deck, Slide 10, you said cash flow from core ops of $2.8 billion. And this time, on Slide 11, you're saying $2.5 billion. Now I think you're trying to say the same thing because there's some receivables, some from the financing division, that are floating around. And I just want you to clear that up because I think that some folks today think that these slides don't match up and that there's $300 million less in free cash flow for the year. And I'd like you to clear that up right now.", "Luca Maestri", "What really happened, my purpose was to simplify the chart and really what should matter to investors is cash from operations, which has always been $2.5 billion. The number has not changed and it's not changing. At a certain point, we talked at kind of a subset of cash from operations. We talked about cash from core operations, so $2.8 billion, and then we said that there would be a use of $300 million from the growth of our finance asset portfolio, right? But cash from operations is what matters. It's $2.5 billion. It was always $2.5 billion. And then how debt translates into available cash. Debt also has not changed, it's $1 billion to $1.2 billion. And you just go from the $2.5 billion of cash from operations, then we've got our CapEx of about $600 million, then we talked about debt reduction of $600 million and dividends of $300 million, right? So that's the math, nothing has changed. We just kind of simplified the chart and really, the metric that matters to us is cash from operations.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then on top of this, there's $300 million dollars in finance receivables that will roll off that are not included here.", "Luca Maestri", "That's correct. Well, no, it means that our receivables related to the financed assets are going to grow by $300 million, and therefore, cash from core operations before our finance asset portfolio has to be $2.8 billion because it's going to be usage of $300 million from the finance assets.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Okay, then I got it, right, I misspoke. Okay, I got it. So nothing has changed, 100%. And the net cash flow is still same and you just simplified it. Now Ursula and Luca, a question for you. When you mentioned the cash flow in your speech, Ursula, you said that it was strong and it was a big focus and it's absolutely coming back. When you mentioned what you're going to use it for, you said acquisition. But in your slide, it says majority going to share repurchases. I assume you meant the majority going to share repurchases and then a minority going to acquisitions. I just want to be clear on that.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I'd say if you -- I think I said exactly what you just said, which is that we'll have $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We'll use 70% of that with the majority of that for share repurchase, and we'll then make acquisitions. On this cash statement, on this cash discussion, $2.8 billion to $2.5 billion to $1 billion to $1.2 billion, 70% of the $1 billion to $1.2 billion for share repurchase and acquisitions. The vast majority of the $1 billion to $1.2 billion is share repurchase. Nothing has changed, nothing has changed.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "And it can start in August, right?", "Ursula Burns", "It can start in the second half of the year, which is what we said. I'm not going to -- not continue down to August, second half of the year. On the call, I want to be confident of the following things:1, that we will generate the cash. That 's what we do. We've done it for as long as I've been here and Luca has not changed 1 step in that actually. He's put additional focus on it. We'll get $2.8 billion. We'll use $300 million for finance receivables. We'll get $2.5 billion. We'll use CapEx, et cetera, et cetera, get to $1 billion to $1.2 billion. We'll take 70% of that and we'll buy back shares as soon as we can start doing it. And then, the rest of it, we'll use for acquisitions, for dividends, for whatever we can think of that's really great with the rest of the cash that we have.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "And then just on nit, Luca, on modeling. Should we use a 29% tax rate going forward? And what should we model for equity income? Should it just be something around $30 million a quarter or $20 million to $30 million a quarter net of restructuring charges for Fuji Xerox? Thanks, that's it.", "Luca Maestri", "The guidance for the tax rate is 31% for the rest of the year. So 29% in Q1 was just an outcome but we continue to see about 31%. And obviously, the equity income from Fuji Xerox is a question mark also for us, so maybe we can compare notes. But yes, $20 million to $30 million is the number.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Thank You.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great, thanks. Ursula and with Luca, I was hoping that you might be able to give us some idea of how to think about gross margin here over the next quarter or two, given the puts and takes that you've talked about during your prepared comments. On the one hand, it seems like you're going to have some extra cost associated with air freighting equipment and expediting stuff out of Japan. On the other hand, currency is moving back in the right direction, and my understanding is that you typically go back and renegotiate your supply contracts with Fuji Xerox with a 1- to 2-quarter lag and recoup some of the negative impact of currency over time. So how should we think about gross margins over the next quarter or two?", "Luca Maestri", "I would say this quarter was affected by half a point was currency, right? And then the rest was a this shift of our mix of revenues towards services that carries lower gross margin. Going forward, I would say that we should be seeing an improving trend on gross margins. You're absolutely right. I think freight will be a headwind because of the situation in Japan. But using today's rates, the currency headwind is mitigating significantly. There is a lot of volatility in FX these days. So every day is a different story. But as a trend, currency should be much less of a headwind. And typically -- I mean Q1 is the weakest quarter that we have, right? So with a bit more activity, that will have gross margins as well. So those are the big valuables there. But we said all along, 33% to 35%, we believe that we're going to be in that range for the year.", "Ursula Burns", "And Richard, if I just may on Fuji Xerox contract, we do generally -- we continually negotiate with Fuji Xerox and hedge currency with them and so on. But Fuji Xerox today is a little different than they were 12 months ago, obviously. So they're scrambling. I don't expect that we'll have massive shifts in cost to Fuji Xerox that will help us mitigate this headwind. With that, I think that we'll still be in the 33% to 35% range that we talked about.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And then, I guess one follow-up for you, Ursula. You referred to the fact that you did expect production black-and-white pages to continue to decline. It looked like black-and-white pages were down high-single digits in the quarter, backing into that from the other data that you provided. Does this weaker page growth change your view at all regarding the sustainable growth rates for the core business? And do you still think that pages can grow at some point as we get deeper into an up cycle? Or is this a new norm for us?", "Ursula Burns", "No, I think that -- first of all, I think that we should wait another -- I have to wait another quarter to see more data. This quarter, while the results were very solid for the company, we had some interesting signals this quarter or interesting inputs that I don't consider normal. I'd like to be able to see our way through those a bit before I make a prediction or update my prediction. So without an update of prediction, I would say that black-and-white pages will not accelerate significantly, the decline of them, and that color pages will not accelerate significantly from the way that we were thinking about them in the past. So I think that we'll get through this first half of the year and maybe the first three quarters of the year and be able to see that, not a lot from how we look at the business has changed substantially. The Middle East and Japan and the effect of that on how we can fulfill needs and how customers buy, et cetera, is something that I want to see a little bit more clearly. So I'd wait a quarter to when color pages continue to grow. I think that's good on digital pages in general. Color pages are now about a quarter of the pages that we generate. It's 30% of the MIF. I think that will continue to grow. Our total digital MIF is growing so I think that there's nothing that would say that it would fundamentally change, but I think we need another quarter to see how this all works out.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, all right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Ursula, I had one for you. I wanted to broaden the capital allocation question, and that is, as you look at the next couple of years, philosophically, how are you thinking about the longer-term allocation of capital between the buckets of M&A and then buybacks and dividends? And particularly within the context of M&A, I'm trying to understand how you think about the capital allocation between, say, the core Xerox business, the previous -- the legacy business, I should say, and then the new services business? Because clearly, the growth trajectory, you're having great results on ACS and the core Xerox business has had a little bit of trouble here with the economic cycles in Japan. But just want to understand longer-term, how do you think about that allocation process?", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks for the question. So for the long -- for 2012, our focus, 2011, 2012 is going to be on buying  back shares. So most of the capital that we get for 2011, obviously, we'll start it maybe this year. In 2012, we have a pretty good chunk to go in buying back shares. So for the near term, that's the focus, obviously. But we generate more cash than we need to use in buying back shares. So clearly, after that, we'll continue on our M&A cycle. We're doing that today. We bought 5 to 6 companies so far this year. So we'll continue doing that. And then we will clearly -- I think tail-end of this year, start speaking to the Board and the Board and us will start considering what the heck we do with the dividend. So that progress will continue 2011, 2012. And as we get beyond that, we'll have to see. I mean we'll continue to generate a significant amount of cash to be in dollars plus and we'll have to invest it and we'll buy back shares in a reasonable sense. But after a while, we get to kind of renew our energy on that one so we'll switch to M&A and to dividend. As far as allocations towards core and our core business, technology business and the services business, we are -- our technology business CapEx is fairly well-defined. It's around $300 million, plus or minus a little bit, and I don't see a significant shift, growth or significant decline in that. So I think that as we move forward on CapEx, the way that you can think about it and the way you should think about it on capital allocation in general is more and more will go toward services. Our R&D is going to shift more and more towards our services. Our acquisitions, clearly, are more in the services space, et cetera, et cetera. So you'll see a shift in our capital allocations towards the growth in services. But we will not walk away from the technology business until it's worthwhile to do that.", "Luca Maestri", "Just to add on acquisitions. The acquisitions that we make for call it traditional Xerox are very much focused on distribution, right? And those acquisitions have worked very well for us. And it's very important for us to broaden our coverage, both here in the U.S. and overseas. We made -- probably the largest acquisition that we made during Q1 is a distribution company in the U.K. Very, very important for us to continue to do that because it helps us offset some of the negative trends that you see on the technology front. So I think it's very balanced then. It's not different from what we were doing in the past.", "Ursula Burns", "I will add point there. And I said, we do play -- we have an advantage that we have Fuji Xerox who will continue to focus more heavily on investing in the technology side from an R&D perspective than Xerox does and Xerox will as we go forward. So we get to play a very good, harmonized game here where we can utilize the expertise and Fuji Xerox continue to fuel our technology R&D. We help them do that, obviously. But we will spend a little more time focusing on our services.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right. I guess I'm surprised to see you continue to invest more in the distribution space, given what I think is just tremendous opportunities on the other side, the services space, specifically.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I got you. I mean, if I were you, I'd be really nervous if we didn't try to figure out a way to cover more of the small and mid-sized business growth around the world. I mean, that would be walking away from \"easy money. \" Our big GAAP, we cover the high end market place very well with our technology and our distribution. We do it extremely well. But as you know, that part of the market is not growing as quickly as the small and mid-sized business and it is significantly more focused on margin lowering activities than the small and mid-sized businesses. So what our distribution expansion is all around covering a place where our share is probably half as much as our share in the high end of the business. So the reason we are continuing to invest is because it's business-smart to do. I mean the technology that we have applies  there just as well as it does at the high end. And don't misinterpret my comments. I'm not saying that I'm going to not invest in services. I'm shifting quite a bit to services and expanding our investments there. I just don't believe it's prudent. We don't believe it is prudent to walk away from this very lucrative Technology segment way before you have to.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, thanks for that answer. I just wanted to ask about then -- my final question is just on OpEx. As you think about absolute dollars of spend in OpEx, if I look at, say, June and September, what does that number look like? Is it flat, down, up?", "Ursula Burns", "I think it's probably throughout the year tending upwards. Tending upwards.Yes, because our revenue in  the third and fourth quarter in particular is growing, will grow. It will grow at a pace higher than it did in the first quarter and then it will in the second quarter. So as our revenue grows, our OpEx will have to grow to support that growth.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, all right. Well, many thanks. I'll cede the floor.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "I guess, Ursula and Luca, could you maybe talk through some of the interplay that we are beginning to see between Services signings and Services revenue growth, I guess, those dynamics? Particularly as the signings of -- the growth has sort of come down to, I guess, low-single digits to where it is now. What should we expect through the year on each of those metrics? And I guess ultimately, maybe if you look towards -- I mean, maybe not 2012, I know you don't want to give guidance. But I guess, what ultimately should we think of as sort of normalized signings growth rates when things settle in?", "Ursula Burns", "I'll start and Luca can jump in if he has anything to add. First of all, most important metric is revenue, and we're really pleased with our overall revenue growth. The combination of new business signings, which is really important, so you get new businesses that adds on to the revenue you have, and annuity revenue that we have that we will continue to get, we have and will continue to get from already committed signed contracts is exciting there. And you saw the growth in revenue there, BPO up 8%; Document Outsourcing, a really good rebound, up 4%; and ITO, up 1%, after a strong first quarter of about 5% growth. So across the board, we're happy with revenue. That comes because we signed things previously. And if you could -- the way that you should think about the signings is that we had -- as I said and I'll say again, we had uptick in ITO signings that was fairly dramatic, doubled our signings in ITO. We had an uptick in Document Outsourcing signings that was very dramatic, year-on-year increases, upwards of 40%. So it will continue to drive revenue. Our signings are very good. BPO signings were very strong. We have to think about the fact that we signed $1.6 billion 10-year contracts in -- this is a rich man's problem to explain. You have a signing like California Medicaid and then I have to explain the fact that it's not going as much. I have no problem with that. And so signings in BPO and ITO and Document Outsourcing are all good. The pipeline of signings is mixed very well. The pipeline is mixed very well so signings on a go-forward should be good across the board, ITO, BPO and Document Outsourcing, and our synergies pipeline is up 29%, which includes synergies signings. So I think if you look at signings across the board, we are very pleased with them. We continue to win in all the segments that we focus on. There'll be compares that are difficult in certain quarters because we did greater the previous quarter but net-net pure dollars doing extremely well.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "And I guess -- Ursula, I appreciate that. That's helpful. I guess because signings is something, I think, that you folks are going to increasingly become focused on. Is there any way that we can think of what a normalized signings growth would be? Or over time, should we think of the signings growth approximating the revenue growth? I mean, just so that when we see it move around, or should we expect it to move around, because of the nature of the verticals that ACS is attached to and maybe they're more prone to make a deal? I guess, should we expect the kind of movement that we've seen the last few quarters? Is that normal just so that we know it's normal? Or should we expect some kind of approximation eventually to revenue growth?", "Luca Maestri", "Ananda, I think you know well that signings is not a perfect metric, right? There is a lot of variability within the numbers, right? Think about the fact that we participate in so many verticals and the duration of these contracts can be extremely different. you go from a 3- to 5-year contract. And then in our Transportation business, sometimes we talk about a 50-year contract, right? So obviously, when you sign a very long-term-contract, then you skew the numbers, right? So you need to expect some time of volatility there. Think of our ITO business this quarter. It was up more than 100%, right? Obviously, it has several factors. It's very difficult to give you a normalized rate. Of course, you know in the very, very, very long term, you should approximate  revenue growth, but particularly when you talk about quarter comparisons, it's going to be moving up and down a lot.", "Ursula Burns", "Next question, please. thanks, Ananda.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Ireland with JMP Securities.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any impact you saw in the Services business in the budget delays and some of the uncertainty around government budgets. Has there been any impact there?", "Ursula Burns", "We're really pleased with our government business. It's about -- it's a big piece of our BPO businesses. As you know, it's about 40% of the BPO, ITO business. And if you remove transportation, it's a little bit lower than that. So we're pleased with it is something that we focus on assuring that we win. Now have we seen impact? As more people are employed, the less unemployment there is so we have definitely seen volume declines, lower volume in our service of the government from an unemployment perspective. And we've seen a little bit of lower volumes or a little bit lower revenue as some of the contracts that we won are now ending. Not ending that we lost them, they're ending because they ended. The service is done. But the way that we manage this business is that we actually mix it across the board. So while that's going down, slightly, we have to actually increase and we have increased our signings and our revenue on the commercial side. The answer is yes, a little bit, but not any way that would have me consider government being anything but a very, very lucrative and extremely important portion of our business. But yes, we've seen some downward turns there but not significant.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "Thank you. the other question I had is a little bit more theoretical. Could you give us a sense of the assumptions you're making about the printing business that drives your investment in distribution? I mean are you looking at this purely from a market share gain in cutting off distribution of competitors and getting higher consideration with the same win rate? Or are you looking at a longer-term growth opportunity? I'm just wondering what's driving that decision-making?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, so I think that you should look at it from a purely financial perspective. And obviously, the next step right before, the revenue and profit potential of the business is you have to get share. So let me back up. Big thing here is color. If you didn't have a black-and-white business. Suppose  there was no history in black-and-white, everyone in the world who is competing today would be competing to get a position in this color page market because it is lucrative, because it is growing. So our investment here is in distribution, in R&D, and it's pointed heavily towards color across the spectrum, low to high. That's it. At the same time, we have a black-and-white business that we still have to service. It's not growing but it throws off cash and it's reasonably profitable. So the way that we look at it is running after the part of the business that is growing and that is profitable and that's exciting and keeping hold of for as long as is reasonable, the part of the business that customers still want but at a lowering demand rate. So that's the shift that we're making here. And in order to service that, we need to actually have distribution. We have to have products that serves the customer's needs. You shouldn't think about investing a whole lot of money in black-and-white R&D or black-and-white manufacturing because that's not what we're doing. Most of our investments in R&D and  one of the ways that we can make this shift and in some ways downturn in R&D is by focusing our energies on the parts of the business that are growing.", "Douglas Ireland - JMP Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Ursula Burns", "Your next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Ursula, just a follow-up to an earlier question on deal trends in the Services business, especially for BPO and ITO. Can you give us some color on what you're seeing in terms of sales cycles and also in the pricing environment? And then just as a follow-up for Luca, also in Services, can you help us think about margin progression as we go through the year? Specifically, as you ramp some of the new services revenue opportunities, how should we be thinking about the lag between when you start recognizing those revenues versus the up-front costs associated with that? Thanks very much.", "Ursula Burns", "And so our sales  cycle -- I'll do this relatively quickly and then this will be the last question for the group. Sales cycles, I think what you can think about is not a significant change in trends from previous discussions that I've had but let me remind what they were. For the different segments of our business in the BPO space and in the BPO space if you think about government, the sales cycles are generally long, when I say long, year, a year, a year plus, kind of sales cycle. The deals are generally larger. And our win rate in these long sales cycles, large deals is very good. We have over half the states, for example, in Medicaid, et cetera. So you'll see long sales cycles, difficult challenging sales cycles, that you have to stick with and that we can -- that we win. And it's actually a good business. It's a difficult one but a very good business. In some of the ITO space, the sales cycles are shorter, so significantly shorter, a quarter or less well. And the deals are smaller, obviously. We have two that we signed this year, this first quarter that are longer and bigger than historically but generally, ITO has some walk in takeover deals and they have some shorter cycle deals. So you see the spectrum of them. Document Outsourcing is definitely in between those two, not short, not as long as some of the healthcare, BPO type deals. But they're in the middle of it. So you see them across the board, different durations of selling before you actually win. And the alignment between how long it takes to sell and the size of the deal is pretty much one-to-one, with the long sales cycle the deals generally a lot bigger. Pricing, what we see is that the goal in pricing for new deals is generally attractive, very attractive. It remains attractive through the contract. Renewals are generally at a lower pricing than the old -- than the first time in for sure almost everywhere. And what we find is that what supports this lower pricing is our intimacy and knowledge and the customer's intimacy and knowledge of us. So we can actually still extract good margins, equal margins or improving margins the longer we are with the customer because we actually know how to actually streamline the operations we give to them. One of the things that we do, for example, is to never make the margins get too high, too high because the customers would actually feel disappointed and think that we are actually not sharing the benefits adequately with them. So whenever we get a really wide margin spread, we would go to a customer and renegotiate it before the contract was up. So margins, pricing on a new deal is lower than pricing on the old or the renewed deals, lower than pricing on the old deal margin should be the same, and if we're really good at how we manage it a little bit of growth in the margins portion. And then, Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So from a ramp-up perspective, keep in mind, we've got a very, very diversified portfolio of services, right? So a lot depends on the mix of the portfolio in places like ITO or customer care. The ramp up is fairly quick in other places within BPO or transportation, for example. We're talking about much longer ramp up periods, up to 18 months. And also, the profitability of the different lines of business is different. So the net outcome of this is very influenced by mix. We do expect -- you were asking about how do we think about gross margins for the Services business for the rest of the year. We do expect the margin to be more or less where we are right now, maybe a slight improvement because we continue to work on, both on the restructuring initiatives and also on synergies, also on the services side. It's not only in technology. So flat to slightly up for the year.", "Ursula Burns", "Okay. Thanks to all of you for your time and for the good questions and for your interest. I look forward to seeing you in May, on May 10, at the investor conference. Please enjoy the rest of the day.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. This is a reminder of the strategy that we're executing on to transform our business. As I've said before, many people talk about transformation, and we're actually doing it. Through these 4 priorities, we mark our progress and measure our results.", "First, capturing the sizable opportunity from scaling our Services business. You'll see this quarter that we grew our Services revenue by 6% with very strong performance in both Document Outsourcing and Business Process Outsourcing. Our pipeline grew 21%, and we continue to benefit from revenue synergies through cross-selling with ACS. ", "Second, maintaining our leadership in document technology. We continue to hold the #1 revenue market share position overall and in color, and we are launching new products that solidify our strong leadership. This quarter, revenue in installed were impacted by the supply constraints stemming from the earthquake in Japan. We're on track to reduce backlog while meeting new demand in the third quarter.", "Third, continue to improve the efficiency of our business operations, running a lean and flexible annuity base business. This served us particularly well in Q2. Our disciplined approach to expense management offset the incremental supply chain costs and helped drive strong bottom line results.", "By executing well on these first 3 priorities, we are delivering on the fourth: expanding earnings and returning cash to shareholders. Adjusted earnings per share were up 13% in Q2, so we're well positioned for a solid second half of 2011. We plan to invest more in acquisitions that further scale our services and expand our distribution. We'll resume our share repurchase program during the third quarter, and we're increasing our expectations for full year earnings.", "As with most businesses, we face headwinds or tailwinds during any 90-day period. Our success is determined by how agile we can be to effectively manage complex challenges while staying focused on our priorities. Considering the Q2 cost and revenue headwinds related to Japan, I'm pleased with our progress and confident in the direction that we're heading in for the rest of the year.", "Now let's take a look at Q2 results. ", "Our performance in the quarter reflect progress in our Services-led technology-driven business and our sharp focus on operational improvement. We delivered adjusted EPS of $0.27. As I mentioned, that's up 13% from a year ago. Our GAAP -- on a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.05 primarily from the amortization of intangibles. Revenue was up 2%, aided by the strong euro. Technology revenue was flat and Services revenue increased 6%.", "As we discussed during our Q1 earnings call, supply constraints resulting from the earthquake in Japan did increase our costs and impact install activity and revenue in our technology business. I'll provide a more detailed update in a moment that can tell you that we're already seeing significant improvement, and we expect to be back to normal operations in the fourth quarter.", "Our effective expense management helped to offset the incremental costs incurred from the supply chain challenges, so we were able to maintain steady margins in the quarter. Operating margin of 10.4% was up 3/10. Gross margins of 33.4% is within our range and reflects the result of more revenue coming from services. We generated $347 million in operating cash flow during Q2. We faced some unique challenges relative to cash usage during the first half of the year, including cash needs from ramping new contract signings and incremental cash required to support the supply chain constraints.", "As a result, we are lowering our full year guidance for operating cash flow to $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Our second half of the year is typically stronger for cash generation, so our plans stay the same for $1 billion in available cash to be used toward modestly sized acquisitions and about $700 million in share repurchase.", "Considering our expectations for significant year-over-year cash improvement in 2012, we remain confident in our guidance for next year of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion in cash from operations. Our CFO, Luca Maestri, will provide more detail on cash flow and our financials in a moment. Then Luca and I will both take your questions. So let's turn to Slide 5.", "Before we go into more detail on the results, here's the status on the supply chain issue. The Q2 impact was expected and created a backlog for orders taken in the quarter, orders that we'll be filling during the balance of the year. We're working very closely with our colleagues in Japan to accelerate production and ensure we're meeting our customers' needs. That means alternate sourcing for components and materials, often at a higher cost, and it means more expensive distribution methods like airfreight to expedite shipping.", "We're pleased with Fuji Xerox's operational management during this challenging time. As you will see in the Q2 results, our equity income from FX was better than expected. It is difficult to project if this will continue since FX is still working through the uncertainties in their business and in their geography. We continue to expect that production levels will be back on track over the next couple of months and that we'll resume normal supply chain operations later in Q3 and into Q4. We maintain a 24/7 focus on management situation in Japan and throughout our supply chain. I'm confident that the worst is behind us, so we can focus intently now on reducing backlog and meeting new demand.", "Let's turn to Slide 6 for a more detailed review of Q2 revenue. Here you'll see the relatively even revenue contributions from our Services and Technology business. We expect that Services percentage will continue to grow as we invest more in broadening our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally. This growth strategy results in more long-term contracts that benefit our annuity stream, which is now 84% of total revenue. Total revenue of $5.6 billion was up 2% or down 1% in constant currency. Equipment sales, as I said, were largely impacted by the supply constraints.", "With a series of recent product launches and a supply chain recovery, we expect improved equipment sales in the second half of the year. As Luca will share with you, our new products are very well-received in the marketplace and fill a need for affordable and more productive color printing in offices and print shops.", "Please turn to Slide 7 for a review of key metrics in our Technology business. The metrics on this slide will look very familiar to you. We've reported on them for a while, reflecting our strategic focus on moving black-and-white pages to color devices. You'll see strong progress this quarter with color MIF growth of 15% and color page growth of 8%. Digital page trends are the same on a quarter-to-quarter basis, no change, and continue to reflect declines in transactional black-and-white pages.", "It's important to note that our MIF metrics exclude printers, exclude our business in developing markets and products sold through Global Imaging Systems. And page counts include only estimates in those 3 areas.", "That said, as we execute on our strategy to expand in direct channels to increase our Global Imaging business and to grow Document Outsourcing, we increasingly have less ability to accurately measure all the pages printed on Xerox systems and the number of machines in the field. So going forward, you'll see us report less on MIF in pages. Instead, we'll provide more context on install activity and revenue growth.", "More important to our annuity streams is our growth in services. The multiyear contracts from -- for our Outsourcing business deliver stronger recurring revenue. In Q2, Services revenue was up 6%, or 4% in constant currency. Our leadership in Managed Print Services contributed to 10% growth in our Document Outsourcing business, and the breadth of our offerings in Business Process Outsourcing resulted in 9% BPO growth. Strength in both of these areas offset a decline this quarter in IT Outsourcing. Luca will share more details in a moment.", "I'm often asked if the pressure on government spending are impacting our business, especially in the BPO space. We are exceptionally well positioned with federal, state and local governments around the world. Revenue from our government contracts often fluctuates based on usage patterns. For example, in Q2, growth in transportation services helped offset the lower volumes from unemployment claims. This is another benefit of having a diverse portfolio in BPO. It gives us flexibility to manage through the changing dynamics in government spending. So our government business does go through cycles, but net-net, we review our strong -- we view our strong hold in this space as a key asset of our business today and going forward.", "In the quarter, signings for Xerox's services totaled $3.5 billion, up more than 15% from last quarter and down 10% on a trailing 12-month basis. This decline was due to the cyclical nature of contract signings and longer lead times for large multiyear deals, some of which were completed this month. Our pipeline remains very strong, up 21%, in helping to fuel our healthy annuity stream for the long term.", "So summing up the quarter. I'd characterize it as a good overall progress quarter, especially considering the unprecedented supply chain challenges. We've effectively executed on all of our key priorities, which are: scaling our Services business through our expertise in management services and BPO, strengthening our leadership in Document Technology through expanded distribution and innovation that accelerates the adoption of color, effectively managing our global operations and generating cash so that we can return shareholder value through stock buyback and dividends.", "With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. This was a challenging quarter in some respects, given the impact from Japan, but eventually we were successful in offsetting the constraint to revenues and deliver strong EPS. This is encouraging as we look forward to a Q3 where we should see recovering Technology and acceleration in Services.", "Revenue growth was 2% in Q2 at actual currency, with a 3-point benefit from currency. Services drove the growth and was up 6%, while Technology was flat. In the second half, we expect revenue to be within our 3% to 5% guidance range.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 10.4%, up 3x year-over-year and up over 1 point from Q1. We saw sequential improvement also in gross margin. However, year-over-year, gross margin was impacted by the mix of business, by the ramp of new service contracts and incremental supply chain cost related to Japan. This impact was more than offset by disciplined expense management. RD&E and SAG ratios improved significantly due to restructuring synergies and improved bad debt trend. We remain on track for our full year objectives of $270 million of restructuring savings and over $120 million of cost synergies.", "Equity income in the quarter was $34 million, which slightly exceeded our expectations and reflected restructuring benefits at Fuji Xerox, more than offsetting the disruption from the tsunami. The $34 million includes $4 million in Fuji Xerox restructuring costs, which we are not adjusting out this year. Adjusted EPS was $0.27 and grew 13% year-over-year. The only adjustment to reported EPS were the amortization of intangibles and the loss on early extinguishment of liability from the redemption of the trust preferred securities that we mentioned during the Q1 call. As a result, GAAP EPS was up 38% year-over-year.", "Let us now move to the Technology segment on Slide 9. Technology revenue, up $2.5 billion, was flat at actual currency and down 4% at constant currency due in large part to the impact of Japan on product availability. Segment margin of 11.8% was up over 1 point year-on-year and continues to reflect the benefits from restructuring and synergy savings.", "Entry install performance is weighted heavily towards developing markets, and as I indicated during the Q1 call, face a difficult compare in Q2, given the 56% install growth that we had during Q2 of 2010. The recent product launches should drive improvement in this product segment during the second half. Mid-range growth continued despite being the product segment most impacted by the Japan shortages. This performance reflects our very competitive color portfolio, which was further strengthened by the launch of our latest ColorQube family of products in Q2, and we expect this favorable trend to continue as we start to address our backlog situation in Q3. In high-end, we saw mixed performance. iGen4 had a very strong quarter, reflecting demand for new features. The 800/1000 Color Press also showed good growth but not enough to offset declines in the Entry Production Color space. We have a product gap in this category, which we anticipate will be helped by a series of product actions, the first of which is the recent launch of the new 8080 product line. In summary, good progress on cost and expenses, offsetting impacts from Japan to drive operating profit growth of 10%.", "Moving on to Services, Slide 10. Services revenue was up 6%, with BPO up 9% and Document Outsourcing up 10%. ITO revenue was down 10%. BPO's 9% growth was driven by recent acquisitions as well as human resources and healthcare payer services and by increasing customer care and transportation volumes. This growth more than offset declines in government services, lower unemployment claims volume, as an example, and the timing of contract runoff and ramp. BPO signings were at $1.8 billion, which is lower year-on-year but up over 40% sequentially. And we have good prospects and high expectations for BPO signings in Q3, which has started on a strong note.", "ITO revenue declined 10%, driven by lower third-party hardware and software sales and lower recurring revenue as we have not yet seen the contract ramp from recent strong signings. Document Outsourcing had a very good quarter, with revenue up 10%, thanks to the ramp of the new signings and improving page volumes. Signings of $1.4 billion were also strong, with both renewals and new business up double digits.", "Overall signings declined 10% on a trailing 12-month basis but grew over 15% sequentially. The trailing 12-months calculation includes the 10-year $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal we signed in Q1 of 2010 as well as the Texas Medicaid renewal that occurred in Q2 of 2010 for close to $1 billion. We continue to see strong growth in our Services pipeline, up 21% including synergies, and this is, of course, a positive indicator for future signings. ", "Segment margin of 12.1% was up 1.8 points sequentially but down 0.5 point year-on-year, reflecting impact from contract start-up cost and lower volumes in some government transaction areas. In summary, overall solid performance in Services with expectations for improvement both in signings and in ITO during Q3.", "With that, I now move to the balance sheet slide. As we communicated during Q1 earnings, we called our 2027 trust preferred securities in Q2, and we refinanced this amount by a very successful bond offering at lower cost. These securities carried an 8% coupon, and this action will reduce interest expense. Our Q2 ending debt balance increased to $9.3 billion, but to be clear, our interest-bearing liabilities remain unchanged as the trust preferreds used to be reported as a separate balance sheet line.", "The vast majority of our debt is, as you know, in support of our financing business. Of the $9.3 billion debt balance, $6.3 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $7.2 billion, and these finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.", "We have a debt payment in August, which will get us to our year-end debt balance of $8.6 billion, and with the majority of our debt supporting our financing business, we have a strong capital structure in place, allowing us to return value to shareholders starting in Q3.", "Slide 12 provides further detail on our cash performance. Cash from operations of $347 million improved over Q1 but fell short of our expectations. Performance was driven by earnings of $327 million, and working capital was a slight contribution to cash flow. Pension and restructuring outflows as well as CapEx of $135 million were in line with plans.", "While the second half of the year is seasonally our strongest, we are reducing our full year operating cash flow forecast to a range of $2 billion to $2.3 billion to reflect our lower first half performance and some headwinds that are unique to this year.", "First, we are achieving growth in Services in a slightly different way than we had anticipated due in part to the mix of business and the combination of contract runoffs and revenue ramp. For instance, we're currently ramping multiple Medicaid and transportation contracts, which require a major upfront cost before they produce significant revenue or cash. We're also supporting ACS' investments in several new services platforms, and we are seeing new signings with higher start-up cash requirements.", "We're also affected by the situation in Japan. In Q2, we have absorbed incremental cost and cash outflows related to air shipments, sourcing from alternative suppliers as well as prepurchasing of materials. This will continue into Q3. The higher-than-normal inventory backlogs and the shift of revenue towards the end of the year also caused a negative impact on cash.", "As Ursula said earlier, this adjustment to 2011 guidance does not change our 2012 cash from operations guidance of $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion, as we will have year-on-year improvement from lower pension funding, lower restructuring payments and higher net income.", "The guidance adjustment also does not impact the $1 billion of available cash for share repurchase and acquisitions. Let me walk through the math. CapEx forecast for the year is now slightly lower at $500 million. This estimate is in line with the $246 million that we spent in the first half. Debt reduction and dividend assumptions remain the same at $600 million and $300 million, respectively. The remainder of the available cash is coming from our year-end cash balance. Cash from operations at the end of 2010 came in ahead of expectations, and we exited the year with a cash balance of $1.2 billion. We do not require a cash balance at this level and can make this excess cash available for share repurchases. This gets us to approximately $1 billion of available cash, consistent with our prior guidance of buying back $700 million of stock in 2011.", "In conclusion, we continue to execute on the strategy Ursula outlined in the beginning. We grew earnings by 15% through a combination of Services growth, operating margin improvement and lower interest expense. And we are focused on leveraging our annuity-based business model to drive cash flow and return value to shareholders with a share repurchase program beginning this quarter.", "With that, back to Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Xerox is now the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. Our expanded offerings, our broad distribution channels, our global scale, renowned brand and innovation give us a differentiated advantage in the marketplace. We're leveraging this competitive position by taking a services-led, technology-driven approach to growing our business. And we continue to operate efficiently, maintaining steady margins and increasing earnings despite the recent Japan impact and -- on cost and revenue. Our capital strategy contributes to our bottom line result and positions us well to continue delivering shareholder value from dividends and, beginning in quarter 3, share repurchase.", "We're on track to deliver solid results in the second half, and we're increasing our full year guidance. Full year expectations for adjusted EPS have been raised to $1.07 to $1.12 per share. For the third quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.24 to $0.26 per share.", "And with that, I thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Benjamin Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Can you talk about what gives you confidence that you can generate so much cash in the second half to still hit your lowered estimate? I mean, you got to do close to $2 billion in cash flow from operations in the back half of the year, the high billions, at least. How do you get there?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, Ben. As you know, second half is seasonally strong. If you go back and look at the past years, you see that we generated very significant amount of cash during the second half. Look at the, for example, in 2010, cash generation. So that earnings are stronger. We expect working capital to be favorable, and those are going to be the primary drivers, so we are fairly confident that we're going to get to that range.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And then what is the savings from the interest expense, the lower interest expense? If you're going to buy, over the next year and a half, $1.7 billion in stock, what happens to the interest and other expense? Does it stay the same, or are there real savings there?", "Luca Maestri", "So interest expense are going to be significantly down this year because we're taking debt down, and we are refinancing at better rates. For example, with the refinancing of the trust preferreds, we'll be generating, on an annual basis, about $20 million savings. About $11 million of debt will have an impact during 2011. And so we will continue to see reduced interest cost as we go into 2012, as well. The share repurchase will come from available cash, and we do not expect any requirements to increase debt for that.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Yes, and you're not earning much on that, I'm sure. Okay, and then you still committed to buying back $1 billion next year even though you have lower cash flow than expected this year?", "Luca Maestri", "Our buying back for next year, we talked about having $2 billion of cash available, and we actually said 70%, so it's probably going to be a higher amount.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, higher amount than the $1 billion, and we are still committed to the share repurchase starting this quarter, flowing through the fourth quarter all the way into 2012.", "Benjamin Reitzes - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And my final question is just around changing metrics around the pages and machines in field, et cetera. So I think at your Analyst Day, you said, \"Well, pages are going to decline, but we have higher-value pages, so we can still grow.\" So I guess I just want to ask, big-picture, is that still true? And then secondarily, I wanted to ask about just in terms of what metrics -- you want us to focus on MIF, and how are we going to use that to really understand the growth of the Technology?", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks for the question. On the changing metrics, I think I gave a little bit of color on what's happening. It's actually good news for our business. It's implementing a strategy that we laid out. We have a great channel in Global Imaging, and we're moving more and more accounts over to Global Imaging to -- for them to farm and grow. We have a growing reseller business where we acquire distribution and move them onto Xerox technology. We have growing business in DMO. You get the message that, literally, we're moving our distribution channels to more -- to a broader set of channels. The good news about that is that we get more activity. The bad news about that is that we don't get all of the visibility that we would have gotten if we sold them directly through our channels. And while I'm not trying to hide anything, we're just trying to not estimate on estimate or estimate and get ourselves into a level of inaccuracy. So what we're trying to do and what we will do on a go-forward basis is to tell you in detail the activity levels that we achieve, and the split of that activity level between black-and-white and color. And we can tell you that because we see that throughout our chain. And we'll talk about revenue. And revenue split by black-and-white and color will also give an indication of how we're performing in our metrics. So installed or activity and revenue are the places that we'll focus as much energy as we can to give as much visibility as we can. So this is not to try to hide anything. It's literally just that our business is actually growing in ways that we don't have deep visibility into the pages or to MIF. I hope I answered your...", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "I guess the first question is, can you give us some sense of sort of the slope of sort of the return in business as you work through the Japanese supply constraints? And do you think -- I mean, is it your opinion that we'll exit this year, enter next year with the Japanese supply chain issues behind us?", "Ursula Burns", "The answer is, we have seen -- we've started to see improvement at the tail end of last quarter, and we're starting to see it in the beginning of this quarter. This is not an inexpensive way to do business. So what -- 2 things will happen in the rest of the year. One is we have a backlog that's buildup. We are staying in contact with those customers, obviously, making sure that we keep the orders on hold and as the supply chain loosens up, as Fuji Xerox production continues to ramp and we get them here, generally still in third quarter, by flying them here, so the cost will still be high. As we get them here, we'll be able to not only alleviate some of the backlog but we'll also be able to fulfill new demand, and that's the mix that we have to do. As we go into fourth quarter, the production should be at regular levels, and we should be tailing out of, still having some, but tailing out of shipping things here by air. Now there's a lot of ancillary costs around that, that we don't talk about. It's really complicated, as you said, to manage this. We have parts that we have to move around in an unusual way. We have people that we have to move around in an unusual way. I think that by fourth quarter we should be done with a lot of the big noise. We should be into a fairly normal operation in the first half of next year, for sure. We should be on a regular business-as-usual basis.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC", "Okay, Ursula, that's helpful. I guess just a follow-up to that, is there any chance that if you don't see demand come back, and if you really -- you think it will, that there's some sort of counterbalance on the cost side that would kind of sort of serve as tailwind to top income dollar. So, for example, if you don't need -- demand doesn't materialize, you don't need to airfreight certain things out, so you get a bit of a counterbalance there. Is that not the right way to think about it?", "Ursula Burns", "Not the right way to think about it. Let me be clear. Demand is not the problem here. Demand is not the problem. I mean, we always have demand problems, as you know, that's what we do. We sell things. People can just call them up and get them from us. But this is not a demand issue. This is a supply issue. So we are -- we're responding to assuring that we don't keep customers hanging on for too long after they've already told us they're going to buy something and given us an order, and that's where the costs are coming in. If the orders don't come in, I mean, we don't incur the costs. But the orders are coming in, so we are incurring the costs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross", "My first question is just about revenue expectations for the second half of the year. Historically, you see seasonal weakness in third quarter, but it sounds like maybe that won't necessarily be the case this year, given the backlog that you had in second quarter. So if you could just kind of talk about how we should think about revenue and the various segments as we look at second -- the second half, basically?", "Luca Maestri", "We expect revenue growth for the second half to be within our guidance range of 3% to 5%. And in terms of the dynamics of the 2 segments: Technology, 1% to 3%; Services, over 6%.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay. But I mean, is there -- when we think about the backlog, it should -- I mean, it seems as if you could have done better in terms of revenue in second quarter, clearly, because you weren't able to ship the products. So how should...", "Ursula Burns", "If you look -- Shannon, if I can just -- I'm sorry for interrupting you, but if you look on our normal business seasonality, we would have lower revenue in quarter 3 than we have in quarter 2. It's usually our lighter -- our lightest quarter. This year, because of some of the reasons that you've brought up exactly, we'll probably -- we will have higher revenue in quarter 3 than we had in quarter 2, so we will definitely see some of that recovery in quarter 3 from quarter 2. We'll see improvement in Technology revenue in quarter 3, for sure.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay, great. That's what I thought was probably the case. And then can you talk a bit about on the BPO signings? If we think of sort of net of the large contracts that you had in the prior year period, what was the growth there? Are there any large contracts pending? Just how you sort of see the pipeline for BPO.", "Luca Maestri", "Okay, let me start with the signings, and then we'll talk about pipeline. You're right, we had 2 what we call megadeals that affect the metrics. It's the California Medicaid and -- which was a new signing last year, and Texas Medicaid, which is a renewal from last year. If you exclude from the calculation -- we don't want to exclude it because, of course, it's a good business for us. But if you exclude the 2 megadeals in the metric, then we would show signings growth of 9%. The pipeline in BPO right now, it is very strong. We talked about a total Services pipeline of over 20% growth, and BPO is in the same range. And we've got a lot of good prospects, particularly in the commercial area, particularly on the Commercial segment.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay, great. And then my last question is just with regard to sort of end demand, what you're hearing from your customers, thoughts about Europe? Just any color you can give, given some of the questions that are out there with regard to the macro events that are going on. And it seems as if enterprise is holding in there, but I'm curious as to what you're hearing.", "Ursula Burns", "We are seeing enterprise -- I'm going to end -- start with your last comment. We are seeing enterprise hold up. We're not -- it's interesting. Europe is not -- we're not impacted by some of the situations in Europe yet, but we are very cautious about this. The trends here are not -- and the noise from this part of the world's not getting better. I don't -- so we are operating really tight to the cuff to make sure that we don't get ahead of ourselves, meaning that we know that we're not going to be oblivious to the continued weakness, economic weakness in Europe. So we're not seeing it yet, but we'll see how it goes. U.S. enterprise is good. It's -- no fundamental change. We are seeing slowing of decisions particularly in the government sector, which doesn't surprise anyone, and volume's down in some parts of our government business. Luca referred to unemployment benefits, which are down primarily because people are rolling off the rolls, not necessarily because they're getting jobs. So government, we see -- it's still a great business for us, still strong local, state and federal, but it goes up and down depending on the contracts that we see. Technology business, it's kind of going along as normal. We don't see a lot of changes anywhere in the world. We do see weakness, which we saw last quarter, in the Middle East, but we're just dealing with that as a normal outcome of a business. And strength in Russia, normal flows there.", "Shannon Cross", "And I know you don't sell into China but through Fuji Xerox and what you've done there, as well as India. Any comments on sort of what you're seeing there?", "Ursula Burns", "We do sell into India, and we are particularly pleased with some of our Services success in India. That's where we're focusing a lot of our energy, particularly Document Outsourcing services where we've engaged with a significantly deeper and more pointed focus since the beginning of this year, and we're seeing some success there. And Luca, why don't you talk about China?", "Luca Maestri", "So China, in general, Asia Pacific, was a good region for Fuji Xerox during Q2. Of course, they got significant issues in Japan. And the issues in Japan will continue into Q3, particularly they're going to have power shortages during the summer. So yes, I mean, there, Asia-Pacific and China business helped offset some of the domestic situation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Ursula, is there any way to normalize what revenues would've been if you could've gotten normal fulfillment? Just what would revenue growth have been in either in total or however you want to answer it?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes. We think that we -- at a minimum, we were impacted by about 3 percentage points, at a minimum, in Technology. It didn't really affect anywhere else, in Technology, at a minimum. Now the reason why we haven't gotten into this and trying to do a big mathematical thing is because, when something like this happens, you do a lot of things. One of them is to redirect your sales force. And you make them, because we have a supply shortage, significantly less effective than they would have been normally. So we don't spend a lot of time actually trying to figure that out. What we are preparing to do is to assure that we have, which is what we're doing, the supply that's needed to back-fill -- to fulfill all of the backlog and to take on new demand. But yes, we definitely suffered to the -- at least 3%. That's what we know, the orders that we know that we couldn't...", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then, Luca, when you gave the revenue targets for September, just to be clear, were those in constant currency or as you think they'll be reported with the help of FX?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, good question. Sorry, I didn't mention it before. 3% to 5% we're saying right now for the second half of the year. We say constant currency. And of course, if the rates stay where they are right now, there could be an uplift of another point or so from currency.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, then, fair enough. And then on -- ITO was a little, certainly, a little lower than we were thinking. How does that track as we get into the second half of the year?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, better. So ITO was not a strong point for us in the quarter. Interestingly enough, we had some really good -- very good signings in ITO in the quarter, but we had a little bit higher-than-normal set of losses, and some of those we knew. We knew that we would be coming down in some of the ITO bids because they were ramping down, not because we lost them but because they were not going to be there anymore. What we see in signings, as I said, is a projection. Signing projections are good, and the contract ramp for some of the things that we won look good. In quarter 3, we must, we will include -- improve our ITO business. As you know, we talked about MGM and Allscripts, 2 very, very, very large ITO bids that we won, which is very encouraging. BPO still stays like an engine and Document Outsourcing, as well, and ITO should improve in the second -- third quarter and fourth quarter.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. And then my last one is, very strong expense management, very nice job. How does that -- how does SAG and R&D track as we look at Q3 specifically? Because it looked like headcount stayed about the same, and yet your expenses were down materially from the March quarter or from last year, however you want to look at it.", "Luca Maestri", "So I think, what we did in Q2, we really wanted to protect the quarter, and we took a lot of actions, and it came out right. At the same time, we want to balance this for the rest of the year with the idea we want to continue to invest in the business, brand investment, people investment, and we want to grow the business. So I would say that probably some of the performance that you've seen in Q2 will not repeat in the second half on the expense side.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Right, so I would assume that translates to OpEx goes up sequentially from Q2?", "Ursula Burns", "Not necessarily, not necessarily. I...", "Luca Maestri", "Slightly.", "Ursula Burns", "Right, slightly. So yes, I think we have a really good pulse on our cost and expense in the businesses, as you know and if you've been following us. The balance here is, as Luca said, it's really important. We have an anomaly in quarter 2 that will carry on some to quarter 3. What we have to balance, we have to do this -- in a sense, we have to do this in cash. We want to actually make a quarter and rob the business for the future, so we had to invest in people. We continue to invest in people. We continue to invest in our brand. We're continuing to invest in the BPO and ITO business to make sure that we can grow that. And to make sure that we could do that, we took some extraordinary actions on cost, but not so much that they would actually -- they're not so wild that we can't keep some of them going.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Ursula, on Services, your 6%-plus growth outlook appears to be at the higher end of the 4% to 7% guidance range you've talked about in the past. So assuming that the deal and the ITO pieces of it grow in the mid-single digits on a full year basis, that obviously implies very strong double-digit full year growth for BPO. First of all, I guess, can you just clarify how much of that is coming from acquisition? And secondly, I think you mentioned commercial has been strong, but any other color you can share on verticals or even geographies that are driving strength when you look out would be very helpful.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I'll have Luca start on this one, so -- and then I'll dive in after...", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, so in BPO, clearly we are expecting to continue to grow very robustly. A good chunk of the increase comes from acquisition, you were asking the question. Out of the 9%, I would say 5 points this quarter were from recent acquisitions, so obviously, this is part of our model, right? We continue to make acquisitions in the BPO space to fuel this growth. It is the growth engine really for us and also on the Services side, so you should expect to see growth rates that are above the range that we've given for the Services segment overall.", "Ursula Burns", "Right. And then as far as color on the mix, you were right. Commercial was stronger than government. The mix of commercial is in our sweet spots, the spots that we participate in and participate well -- in all of the customer care, some of the healthcare sides of the business, in transportation, for sure. We had strong signings across the board, and we were able to have some of those signings, over 15 of them, in Europe -- outside of the United States. So we're starting to see the expansion that the strategy calls for, which is to have every line of business contribute to growth and to accelerate that growth by going outside of the United States, and we're doing both of those. The notable difference is in certain segments of the government where we're seeing 2 dynamics. One is volumes being a little bit lower. We talked about unemployment as one. Clearly, that's obvious, people can understand that, but -- transactions like that. But also in, for our new business that we're seeing coming, that we're pursuing, longer times to get to closure of a deal, meaning we're participating very well. And we are often down- selected, but we have to do a lot of work with state and federal governments to get the thing actually signed. Not perfect, but very, very good that we are in the throes of the last deals, and they'll eventually come. It's just taking a little bit longer. So commercial, good; healthcare, good; transportation, customer care, good; federal, okay but a little bit slower than I would like it to be. And then ITO, as we said, we had a weakness in the second quarter that will definitely be remediated in the third, given the ramp that we're going to see from the signings that we already have.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Okay, that's really helpful. I guess, if I could just ask one more, Ursula. You've noted a couple of times today just expectations for a very solid second half, yet when we look at your revised EPS guidance for the year, you've taken the full year guidance up roughly by the amount of the second quarter beat. I guess, should we read into that as conservatism? Or is there anything else you're trying to signal in terms of visibility or some other uncertainty that's being factored into that guidance?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I'm definitely not trying to signal conservatism. That's -- I probably shouldn't be chuckling about it. It's hard to get through these quarters, as you probably know. What we -- we have headwinds, for sure, that we're working our way through, from a slowdown in the economy. There's no doubt that, that's -- we're navigating well, but we don't see a big tailwind from the economic forces around the world anywhere. We still see headwinds from Japan. We are balancing that headwind with all of the things that we're doing to run the business. And I think that the guidance that we've given for the second half is prudent, very prudent, given all that we're trying to do and all that we're trying to balance.", "Luca Maestri", "I think you're right. I think we are quite bullish on revenue. We definitely see some pressure on margins, Japan being a case in point because, of course, the old incremental costs that come with that. But in general, because of the uncertainty that you see around the world, in Europe, in government, the supply chain, where we see -- we sense some pressure on margin, and therefore we balance these things, and that's the way we ended up with the revised guidance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "I wanted to go back to Japan and the cost side of the equation there. I know that most of your product coming out of Japan typically goes on a boat. And you probably had sufficient product to handle demand during the first half of Q2. I guess the question is, should we expect airfreight and other logistics-related costs to actually go up in the third quarter as you try to work down the backlog? Or do you expect those costs to go down sequentially?", "Ursula Burns", "No, airfreight will definitely go up in quarter 3. There's -- it will definitely go up in quarter 3. And I think you understand why. You produce -- we could put everything on a boat, but then we'd -- customers would definitely not be pleased with us because they've been waiting for a while. So what we're doing is balancing towards the heavy side, particularly in quarter 3, the first portion of quarter 3, a large amount of our supply coming by air. Because now they've made it, and in order to get it here in a reasonable time, it'll come by air. As we get to quarter 4, tail end of quarter 3 and quarter 4, we start to put more and more things on the boat, and the timing should be able to work to have a normal supply gap, order-to-install gap for clients. And if it turns out the way that we are predicting and the way that -- we have people all over the place in Japan, including our guys there, we should be able to be into normal airship in the fourth quarter. But the third quarter will definitely be heavy -- heavier into airship than even we were in the second quarter.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then I guess the logical follow-up, Ursula, is how much of the incremental cost is associated with airfreight? And if we take a look at total cost associated with the tragedy there, will they be up or down sequentially in Q3?", "Ursula Burns", "They'll be up in Q3. They'll be up in Q3, no doubt about it. And total costs, we just haven't really -- we haven't really given it out. Part of the reason is we haven't really stepped back yet and added it all up. I mean, we're adding it up as it goes. And we will work that with our partners around the world, et cetera, et cetera, but it's -- quarter 3 is going to be a little bit more intensive [ph]. It's comprehended in the numbers that we've given you, for sure. But yes, not much more to say.", "Luca Maestri", "The freight is an important element of the incremental costs, but we set up alternative supply as we prepurchase materials, so there's many different costs that come into the equation. Clearly, airfreight is an expensive proposition, though.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "Actually, could I ask one more question?", "Ursula Burns", "No -- yes.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc", "A little bit of a longer-term question. On ACS, you're taking down your cash flow guidance this year, in part due to the fact that you've got more new business this year than you had expected and less renewal. You've also talked about a big opportunity for ACS longer term being expanding that business into Europe. And a question that I get a lot from investors is whether there's going to be another surprise in terms of cash flow or expense guidance next year as you ramp up investments in infrastructure to handle that expansion of ACS into Europe, leveraging Xerox's presence there. I'd love to get your thoughts on that.", "Luca Maestri", "So clearly, expanding into new market require some use of capital. At the same time, we are present in Europe. We're going to try to go to market with a model that really leverages the existing Xerox infrastructure that already is present in Europe. There's going to be some use of capital, but we are comprehending that into our numbers. As we look at 2012 cash, really there are some drivers that are outside of the ongoing operations that will provide us some positive factors. I mean, we're going to be spending less on pensions. We're going to be spending less on restructuring. So we feel that we certainly are going to generate more cash next year. ACS, already today, even though most of their business is U.S.-based today, they already have a global delivery model. So it's not that we need to go and invest on the delivery model. It's more like the sales force end of the business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "I have a question, I guess, digging a bit more into the cash flow, which I know you've had a lot of questions on already. But I recognize that you guys are pretty confident in the second half and that lends to confidence in a new target. But on the off chance or the low-probability event that you do have some incremental unexpected pressure on cash flow in the second half, how should we think about the risk to the buyback program? How much buffer room do you have in terms of that cash flow target coming down and in terms of maybe pulling from other areas of capital management to maintain the current share buyback target if unexpected events occur on the cash flow line?", "Luca Maestri", "We consider the share buyback a key priority for the second half. So obviously, we're going to be very focused on getting to an available cash of $1 billion. The $300 million on acquisitions, I would say, is a number that is on the low end of the range that we've given previously, and we feel that it is part of our model -- of our growth model, so we need to continue to spend on acquisitions. But there's a number of items on the profit and loss and in the cash flow that we're going to be working very hard. And as we think about priorities, we know that we need to deliver on the buyback.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, great. And then one final question. You had mentioned earlier that you had longer lead times on signing in multiyear Services contracts. Can you give us a little more color on how you're thinking about this as a near-term dynamic or a longer-term dynamic? And if it is a longer-term dynamic, what do you think is driving that? Is this an industry-wide phenomenon? Or is this something that's sort of endemic to Xerox specifically?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I don't think it's endemic to Xerox at all. I think the bigger the contract, and this is what would -- when I talk about longer cycles for signing, generally in government and generally big things. I mean, these are not fall-off-the-lot contracts. So it's definitely associated -- it's an industry-wide phenomenon. It's associated with some of the uncertainty in government, just changes. You get new people sitting in different chairs, that kind of stuff, and the fact that they're big. I would not -- this is not -- should not be considered like a problem. It clearly is -- fix is the word. It gives you some ups and downs in quarters, but they do sign. They do sign. They have to sign because the work has to get done. And generally, if they sign, we win. So I am confident in this part of the business just getting back to normal. I don't think it's something, I think you said, endemic or systematic.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "I also had a cash flow question or 2. Of the $350 million of cash flow reduction in the guidance for the year, how much is related to the supply chain? And how much is related to the Services business?", "Luca Maestri", "I would say it's 60-40. 60, Services; 40, Japan.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "And does that upfront capital commitment -- I guess I'm trying to understand why that wouldn't continue as you try and grow that business going forward. Have you changed any of the terms and conditions you're willing to take on in trying to close some of these contracts? And to sustain growth, why wouldn't you continue to need to deploy that capital?", "Luca Maestri", "Some of the increased cash requirements are coming from the fact that our renewals are maybe slightly less than we would like, right? And hopefully, that trend will not continue, going forward. Secondly, we have a number of investments going on right now for Services platforms. Think of this Medicaid platform, which we call enterprise, and then we've got another platform called eligibility, again related to government services. These are investments that, once they're made, we're going to leverage throughout a number of business lines, and so we do not feel that they're going to be a recurring drain on cash. But clearly, we've always said it all along, if you want to grow working capital, probably it's not going to be the source of cash that it has been for Xerox in 2009, 2010.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG", "For my last question, I wanted to come back to the question around page growth. Last year, for all of last year, equipment sales grew around 9%. And now that's continuing to translate into, what, about 4%, 5% declines in page volume? What does it take to get that page volume to turn up?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, so part of the reason why we're actually thinking about this is because we absolutely do see activity and activity install -- activity growth, color growth, et cetera, all of the things that we spoke about. There's a lot of stuff going through different methodologies that don't -- we don't naturally capture. As I said, Global Imaging, growing like a weed. The pages that are captured -- the equipment that goes into Global Imaging and the pages that come from there, the best that we can do is estimate them. DMO continuing to grow. The best we can do from that is estimate them. So I -- and then competitive devices that we have when we win Document Outsourcing deals, we don't count them at all. So we just can't be as accurate as we once were in this area. I think that we are seeing in this bad time sequential flatness, so we're seeing no change, which if you think about it, based on what happened in the second quarter of this year, is actually a good sign, a good indicator. Bigger mix towards color. From the things that we can even count, a stability in pages. And then the places that we don't count, a significant growth in activity. So I actually -- particularly in Global Imaging and in DMO. So I actually am feeling better about pages than I have in the past. And so what does it take to turn them? I think we're doing all it takes, which is selling more, installing the right types of devices, et cetera, protecting the base that -- like we can, et cetera.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "A couple of questions here real quickly. Luca, could you talk a little more about how investors should think about the contribution to earnings from revenue growth and mix longer term? Obviously, share buybacks can help out here in the near- to mid-term, and you guys have some incremental OpEx activities. But when do we really get the benefit from revenue growth and mix?", "Luca Maestri", "For which year?", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Well, let's do 2012, to start.", "Luca Maestri", "So we talked about revenue growth next year of, say, 4% to 6%. We think that, that growth should translate into earnings. Mix is going to be primarily towards Services, which carry slightly better margins than Technology, so that should be a positive as well.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then the...", "Ursula Burns", "So the business -- I'm sorry, go ahead, go ahead. Please continue, and then I'll kind of bring it all together at the end. Go for it.", "Mark Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Well, I was going to ask just in terms of -- your confidence today seems a little less than usual, Ursula, regarding the color business. Can you guys just talk a little more about -- maybe clarify on what happened in color in terms of the high-end deterioration? How much was tougher compares versus the supply constraints, versus other?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes, I am actually just the opposite on the color business. I -- we have unbelievable activity levels, given the supplied constraint that we had in mid-range color. So in the office color space, we are \"growing like a weed.\" We're doing very, very well. At the very high end of color, the iGen space, very big page compares [ph]. iGen space and the 8000/100 (sic) [800/1000], the Color Press series, very, very strong performance. We had, I talked about this last quarter as well, we have a gap in the high end of the Entry Production Space. We have a gap that we are filling. We launched a product -- just launched a product called the 8080, and we have more offerings to come that will help us regain our position in this space. I actually feel extremely confident about color. And interestingly enough, I am very confident about black-and-white. The only problem with black-and-white is this is not growing, but our share position is very strong. If a deal comes up, we win more than 3/4 of the time, so I'm strong there, confident there. It's just that, that portion is not growing. I spend a lot of time on color, we spend a lot of time on color, and we are all over it. We're #1 color shareholder, we're #1 revenue shareholder, et cetera. So I don't want you to walk away from this call with a statement that we're not confident -- that I'm not confident about it. It's just the opposite. I'm actually very confident about it. And as supply comes, I think we'll be fine here, totally fine here.", "Thank you, all, for joining us today, and I will see you in the field, myself and Luca.

Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation\u2019s Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or re-broadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. To set the stage, here is a year-to-date review of the strategy that is transforming our business. First, accelerating our Services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally. Through the third quarter, revenue from Services is up 6%. Backed by a very positive pipeline, we've been especially pleased with the new contracts we've signed this year. Our new business signings are up 7% year-to-date.", "Second, we're a services-led technology-driven company, which means maintaining our leadership in document technology is a top priority. We continue to hold our #1 equipment revenue market share position, and we've already launched 21 new products this year. And we are competitively advantaged through the breadth of our portfolio, our multiple sales channels and through our innovative workflow and managed print solutions.", "Third, we're managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. Our productivity initiatives this year have helped offset the challenges from the Japan natural disaster and other macro dynamics.", "By executing well on the first 3 priorities, we are delivering on the fourth, expanding earnings and returning cash to shareholders. Through October 24, we've bought back $450 million in Xerox shares with another $250 million planned through the end of the year. And year-to-date, adjusted earnings per share are up 17%. We're on track to grow full year earnings by 15% to 18%.", "The year clearly has not been without challenges, but I'm pleased with the progress that we're making on all 4 priorities, all of which collectively deliver value for our shareholders. Part of the value comes in how we're redefining our business and our brand. As a company in the midst of transformation, I spend a lot of time talking with stakeholders about the new Xerox. It's no surprise that our brand is known for great printing technology, but it's often a big surprise to learn that our technology and services not only change the way the people work, but also how they live. ", "Turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. This is a snapshot of the many ways our innovation is integrated into solutions that simplify how the world works. Through our transportation solutions group, we're working with municipalities around the world to modernize their public transit systems. In cities like Abu Dhabi, where public transport -- transit use is expected to grow 5x in the next 20 years, we've developed a new payment system that require nothing more than a preloaded debit card. Our role is to handle all the project management, the IT integration, processing and payment reconciliation. As the largest provider of transportation services to governments worldwide, we have projects in 30 countries. Our digital solutions for tolling, parking and public transit are being replicated across multiple geographies from New York, Mexico City and L.A. to Casablanca, New Jersey and 400 other municipalities around the world.", "The next example is electronic claims processing. This reflects our expertise in bridging the digital and paper divide. With health care payers, including government agencies like the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, we've created the infrastructure and are managing the process to convert a paper-based claims system into a digital one. The new system for the VA will significantly reduce backlogs and more accurately process benefit claims for veterans and their dependents.", "We're also making it easier for health care companies to communicate with their members. At Medco, we're developing and managing a multi-channel platform that lets Medco's 65 million members personalize how they receive information from the company via hard copy statements, secure websites, e-mail/text messages or a combination of all of these channels. It's a solution that is providing -- is proven to be relevant for several member-based industries and one that is increasing our revenue with banks and other financial services firms.", "All 3 examples demonstrate repeatable, scalable and integrated solutions. This is our approach to real business, improving our client productivity by simplifying the way that they serve their clients. Our results in the quarter reflect progress in these and other areas. So let's turn to Slide 5 for a review of Q3 performance.", "In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.26. That's up 18% from a year ago. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Revenue was up 3%, reflecting growth in Services and aided by the strong euro. Technology revenue was up 1%, and Services revenue increased 6%. Supply constraints due to the natural disaster in Japan have eased considerably, and as we shared with you last quarter, we've been working very closely with our colleagues in Japan to accelerate production and ensure that we're meeting our customers' needs. We've made significant progress in reducing our backlog while meeting new demand, and I'm very confident that these challenges are now entirely behind us. ", "Operating margin of 9.6% was up 0.4 this quarter, and gross margin of 32.7% is down. As demand increases for our outsourcing services, we do see an impact on gross margin, which we continue to offset with cost reductions and operational improvements as you see in our improved SAG results, all of which helped deliver solid bottom line results.", "Cash from operations was $366 million. We've generated $683 million in cash from quarter 3. With quarter 4 always our strongest quarter for cash generation, we remain committed to delivering at least $2 billion in full year operating cash and will continue to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase.", "In a moment, Luca will provide more detail on cash flow as well as review our balance sheet and reporting segments, then we'll both take your questions. But first, let's take a closer look at our top line results on Slide 6.", "A year ago, revenue from Technology and Services was almost equal. Now, Services represents a higher percentage of our total revenue, reflecting investments in building our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally. This growth strategy is generating more long-term contracts, and as I noted earlier, more new business signings, all of which fuel growth in our annuity stream.", "Total revenue of $5.6 billion was up 3%, with both annuity and equipment sales up 3%. Equipment sales are up sequentially as well, reflecting progress we've made in reducing backlog, creating demand for new products and the effectiveness of our growing Managed Print Services. There is no doubt that we have industry leadership in MPS, and we're strengthening this leadership by broadening our offerings. This includes print services geared for midsized businesses and sold through our channel partners and managing an enterprise's entire print infrastructure from their outsourced production printing through to individual worker's mobile print needs.", "Continued external recognition speaks to the competitive advantage of our services-led, technology-driven strategy, and it's helping us grow our business. Revenue from Document Outsourcing was up 12% in the quarter and BPO was up 6%. Joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS have resulted in more than 200 revenue synergy deals this year, delivering significant total contract value for the company and helping grow our pipeline. These deals include a multiyear contract with a major telecom company to administer their employee benefits and a big win with a pharma company to help manage their global learning systems. And at National Grid, the global gas and electricity company, we've developed an integrated solution to redesign their worldwide print and IT infrastructure.", "So summing up the quarter, we're executing well across the business. We delivered steady revenue growth, along with earnings and cash, in line with our expectations. We effectively managed through the supply chain constraints. We are efficient across our global operations and we've launched market-leading products, acquired new services capabilities and expanded our sales channels. We're winning big deals that fuel our long-term annuity, and we resumed our stock buyback program with plans to do more in Q4. We expect this solid performance will continue, positioning us well to deliver on our full year commitments. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Luca. I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered strong EPS in Q3, thanks to improving revenue growth, expense management and equity income. Also, cash came in as planned and we were able to take an aggressive first step in deploying cash towards share repurchase. ", "Starting with our top line, revenue growth was 3% at actual currency, with a 2-point benefit from currency, and increased 2 points sequentially at constant currency. Services continue to drive our growth and were up 6%, while Technology improved and was up 1%.", "Operating margin in the quarter was 9.6%, up 0.4 of a point year-over-year. Gross margin, however, was affected by the shift of business towards Services and the ramp of new contracts. We expect this dynamic to continue as Services growth accelerates and new contracts start up.", "We are offsetting the gross margin impact with disciplined expense management. Both R&D and SG&A ratios improved significantly due to restructuring and synergies. Below the line, equity income in the quarter was $43 million, which reflects continued strong results for Fuji Xerox in Asia-Pacific and benefits from restructuring actions.", "Our adjusted tax rate was slightly lower than usual due to a higher foreign tax credit benefit and offset the negative impact of currency dynamics during the quarter. As a result, adjusted EPS was $0.26 and grew 18% year-over-year. The only adjustment to reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles, and GAAP EPS was up 29% year-over-year.", "Let us move to the Technology segments on Slide 8. We continue to show profit growth in the Technology segment in spite of a relatively soft and volatile economic environment. Technology revenue at $2.5 billion was up 1% at actual currency and down 1% at constant currency. It represented a 3-point improvement over Q2. Segment margin of 10.3% was up 0.3 of a point year-over-year, reflecting restructuring and synergy savings.", "At the product segment level, entry install performance was affected by a combination of continued higher backlog and timing of product introductions. Product launches during Q4 should drive improvement in this segment, which represents 22% of our Technology revenue.", "Mid-range color was the segment most impacted by the Japan shortages, and we saw good growth as the supply chain began to recover. Backlogs are healthy entering Q4 and we expect to continue our positive market performance. Mid-range now accounts for 58% of our Technology revenue.", "In high-end, iGen4 and the 800/1000 Color Press continued to show good growth, and we began to see some improvement in the entry production color space where we had indicated that we had a product gap. Additionally, we have announced 2 very promising new products that we'll be launching towards the end of the year: the Xerox 770, which will further strengthen our entry production portfolio and the CiPress Color Continuous Feed, which brings our solid ink technology into the continuous feed segment, providing very competitive running costs and ability to print on any paper stock.", "Moving on to Services on Slide 9. We continue to deliver good growth in Services despite the economic environment, which is a reflection of the breadth and diversity of our Services portfolio. Services revenue was up 6%, with BPO up 6% and Document Outsourcing up 12%. ITO revenue improved and was flat in the quarter.", "BPO's 6% growth was driven by recent acquisitions, as well as human resources, health care payer, customer care and transportation. This growth more than offset declines in government services and the timing of contract runoffs and ramps. BPO signings were $2.3 billion, which is up over 10% year-over-year and reflects wins across all lines of business, including a significant deal to take over the U.S. check processing services of Symcor, which will contribute approximately $100 million a year in revenues.", "BPO's pipeline remains strong and revenue growth will continue as we start up significant contracts such as California Medicaid during Q4. ITO revenue was flat in the quarter, with contract ramp from recent strong signings offsetting contract losses from earlier in the year. We expect ITO growth to remain constrained as new business signings will be offset by the impact of the contract runoffs.", "Document Outsourcing continues to show strong growth, with revenue up 12%, and this reflects both the impact of new signings and benefits from our partner print services offerings which began to be reported in Document Outsourcing this year and are accelerating. Signings of $1 billion were once again strong, with both renewals and new business up double-digits.", "Maybe the strongest metric for the quarter was total signings, which grew over 30% year-over-year. The trailing 12-month signings calculation declined 9%, as it includes the 10-year, $1.6 billion California Medicaid deal we signed in Q1 2010 and the Texas Medicaid renewal that occurred in Q2 of 2010 for close to $1 billion.", "Also, the total contract value of new business signings was up over 70% year-over-year, and annual revenues expected from new business signings were the highest ever for the company. Even after a strong signings quarter, the pipeline remains healthy and is up 5% including synergies.", "Segment margin of 11.9% was up 7/10 of a point year-over-year, thanks to good expense management and the benefits from restructuring, offsetting impacts from contract start-up costs.", "Moving on to our key metrics slide. In this quarter, we are including all of our key metrics reporting on one single slide. I think it provides a good snapshot of our business drivers. I just reviewed signings and installed performance on the previous slide but I would like to take a moment to touch on color, machine in field and page metrics. Keep in mind that these metrics include the Technology segment plus Document Outsourcing.", "Total color was up 9% or 6% at constant currency. Digital MIF, machines in field, continued to grow and was up 3% in total; 14% for color-capable devices. Finally, digital pages showed an improvement in the quarter and were down 3% year-to-date, with pages from color devices up 9% year-to-date.", "Moving on to the balance sheet on Page 11. Our Q3 ending debt balance decreased $100 million from Q2 to $9.2 billion and included the repayment of $750 million in term debt, an increase of $650 million in our commercial paper program. We continue to target a year end debt balance of $8.6 billion, which is a $650 million reduction from our 2010 year end interest-bearing liabilities of $9.3 billion and would put us very close to our steady-state leverage. The vast majority of our debt, as you know, is in support of our financing business.", "Of the $9.2 billion debt balance, $6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.9 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.", "Our strong capital structure and cash generation has enabled us to resume our share repurchase program. During the quarter, we spent $309 million and repurchased 38 million shares. We have continued that activity into Q4. And as of October 24, we have repurchased additional $140 million or 18 million shares for a total of $450 million or 56 million shares since the start of the program.", "We have also made a portion of our Q3 domestic pension funding stock amounting to approximately 60 million shares. This decision gave us further flexibility in managing our cash flow during the quarter to meet all our cash priorities, including being present consistently in the market to repurchase shares during a time of extreme volatility. We continue to plan to repurchase 700 million shares in 2011 and anticipate a Q4 average fully diluted share count of approximately 1,425,000,000 shares, and at year end, fully diluted share count of approximately 1,405,000,000 shares.", "Slide 12 provides further detail on our cash performance. Cash from operations of $366 million was equal to Q3 of 2010 and positions us to deliver our cash flow guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion. Performance was driven by earnings of $329 million, consistent with normal seasonality, working capital during the quarter was a use of cash of $168 million. Pension contributions of $225 million were $83 million higher year-on-year due to anticipated catch-up payments. CapEx was $121 million in Q3, $367 million year-to-date, and is on track for approximately $500 million for the year. During the quarter, we also invested $51 million on tuck-in acquisitions both in Services and Technology, $69 million on dividends and reduced debt by over $100 million.  ", "In summary, during Q3, we continued to execute on our strategy. Revenue growth of 3% was an improvement over the first half of the year. Services signings were very strong, up over 30% year-over-year. Operating margin improved. Adjusted earnings grew 18%. Cash flow is on track, and we began the share repurchase program at a strong pace.", "With that, back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Well, thanks Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. We've been successful in leveraging our brand, our global scale and innovation to win multi-million dollar deals for Xerox technology and for our diverse outsourcing services. We run our operation with a disciplined approach to cost management. This becomes increasingly more important as we are ramping new services contracts, contracts that require upfront investments in time and resources and therefore impacts our gross margins. It's a shift in how we manage our business model.", "We're driving efficiencies across the enterprise that result in improved operating margins, all while possibly growing our business and generating cash. Like any business, we'll always have headwinds that need to be offset and tailwinds that give us added benefits. But when it nets out, we're delivering steady top line growth, solid bottom line results and delivering shareholder value through dividends and share repurchase. It's this across-the-board progress that I'm confident will continue.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect to deliver adjusted earnings of $0.32 to $0.35 per share. This will bring our full year adjusted EPS of $108 (sic) [$1.08] to $111 (sic) [$1.11], a year-over-year increase of 15% to 18%. ", "Thank you again for joining us today, and now let's open it up to your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross", "My first question is with regard to geographic trends. Canon noted pressure in Europe. Lexmark kind of talked about pressure all over. Can you talk just a little bit about what you're hearing from your customers both in terms of demand for products on Technology and Services? And then also printing volumes just in general, what are you hearing?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. So from a demand perspective geographically, we still see -- we continue to see the strongest demand in our developing markets' economies, Russia, the Eurasian regions, some of the Latin and Central American countries are the strongest. I think the next grouping would be -- the next group of countries or the next country would be the United States. It's a little bit stronger than Europe, it's not as strong as DMO. And we haven't seen -- we're seeing a overhang in the U.S. that is dampening go-forward expectations from our clients, particularly from the government. But so far this year, we've been able to manage very well in that environment. And then in Europe, I think it's a little bit weaker than the U.S. So it's like a waterfall, DMO, developing markets, the strongest, United States kind of wallowing around in the middle and Europe is definitely seeing a fall over it. On a go-forward basis, I think it's important for me to talk about that as well. On a go-forward basis, we do see continued headwind from a macro environment in the U.S. and in Europe. There's no doubt about it. The conversations are all muted with our customers across-the-board, and so we don't expect that this economic environment will improve in the fourth quarter very much. As far as page trends go, we see, as Luca discussed, continued growth in color and continued softness particularly in the high-end, black-and-white printing segment. Some of the growth that we saw in the third quarter was driven by the fact that we had a pretty large backlog from the second quarter. And we'll see a little bit of that continue into the fourth quarter. But by the end of this quarter, we expect all of the backlog to be totally cleared up and we'll be back to normal, which I think is about flat on Technology revenues for the fourth quarter. Did I answer all your questions, Shannon?", "Shannon S. Cross", "Well, not all of them yet, but yes, I think you answered that one. Luca, can you talk a little bit about the biggest drivers of your confidence in cash flow during fourth quarter? Because clearly, it's a large -- extremely large cash flow quarter. So just if you can walk through some of the puts and takes we should keep in mind.", "Luca Maestri", "Q4 seasonally is our strongest quarter. We intend to deliver stronger earnings than the rest of the year. When -- Shannon, when you look back at our historical performance during Q4, you see, for example, that in Q4 of 2010, we delivered the same level of cash flow, operating cash flow that would be required to get to our range, so we've done that in the past. Clearly, working capital needs to be a positive during Q4. It's been a positive historically. And so we are -- we know that it is the biggest quarter and we've got the plans in place to get there. And of course, we're also trying to position the company for growth, which is very important and has required some investments during the course of the year. We recognize that.", "Shannon S. Cross", "Okay. And then I guess my final question is we've heard from a few companies about potential impact from the Thailand flooding. So can you talk a little bit about what you -- how you're thinking about that and if there's any impact we should worry about.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, first of all, I mean, our hearts go out to the people in Thailand and anything that we can do to help, we will do as a company, particularly if we have suppliers or any clients or customers out there, we will help them. This couldn't be a worse year for natural disasters. I think we've had it all. However, we expect that we will have -- no, no impact from the natural disaster in Thailand from a direct-to-Xerox supply perspective. We've already checked with our supply chain, and we've gotten very positive feedback back. It turns out that we fortunately don't source hard drive, hard disk drives from that region, and that this happens to be something that fell on a positive side for us this time, not on the negative side. We do expect though and it's possible that there will be some impact from equity income from Japan. We don't know that for sure. We still have to wait until this clears up a little bit, and we'll see that as it goes forward. But for Xerox Corporation supply, supply to our customers, et cetera, we expect no impact at all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes for Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Wanted to ask about the yen. It keeps strengthening on you. And have you been able to do any renegotiating with Fuji Xerox to maybe improve the baseline? I know you have a 50-50 sharing agreement. Could you talk about maybe how you hedge it and then how that factors into gross margin guidance, not only for the fourth quarter but maybe also next year? And then I have a follow-up.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So clearly, Ben, strengthening yen is a headwind for us. I would say at today's rate, for the full year, we would be looking at about 0.2 of a point in terms of the impact on margins for the company. So it's not particularly material. As you know, we...", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "But that's for next year? That year-over-year...", "Luca Maestri", "No, no, this is for 2011. This is the year-on-year impact for 2011 versus 2010. We do hedge out 12 months, and therefore, any impact from currency movements gets delayed a bit. And so obviously, in general, a negative yen is -- strong yen is not a positive for us as you will know. We manage it actively through the hedging program that we, of course, as you said, we've got a currency sharing agreement with our partner Fuji Xerox. And as we develop partner programs, in general, of course, we try to set targets, taking into account a yen that is stronger than it was in the past, and so we need to continue all our efforts in terms of being very competitive on cost, and that's -- those are the ways we manage together with Fuji Xerox. So far, I would say that when you look at our Technology margins for the year, I think it's pretty commendable that they've held up the way they have in spite of the continuing appreciation of the yen.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Do you have any idea what's the hit in the fourth quarter next year? Similar?", "Luca Maestri", "Q4 of 2012?", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "2011.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. Q4 is going to be again, about 0.2 of a point. It's low double-digits.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Then earlier today, Canon lowered guidance for their laser printer shipments due to an HP inventory adjustment. Obviously, you're aware of HP in the news and whatnot. Are you -- see, it was laser printer-related but given they're are a big player in MPS, there's a lot of overlap with you guys. Canon's copier numbers were actually fine. So I was just wondering if you're seeing any change in the competitive environment that's HP-related and that's helping your business or impacting your business and trying to put together what they said this morning.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. What we're seeing, HP -- and then I'll just broaden it to other competitors as well. As you know, HP the company is having lots of disruption. But what we're seeing from HP, our segment is a continued strong competitor. I mean, they are -- we haven't seen a lot of hiccups or backpedaling in the market from HP. They continue to be a strong competitor. Where we succeeded and HP has may not be succeeding as much is in 2 segments: One is our MPS, or our Managed Print Services offering attacks HP's strengths straight on. And more and more customers, as you can see from our Document Outsourcing strength this year, 12% year-over-year this quarter, 12% growth in MPS of print services, our Managed Print Services offerings are taking off and it actually works to consolidate where HP's strength is, which is in single function printers. The other place that we're very strong and continue to be strong is in the very high-end production printing segment. iGen4 and our color press technology continues to do well there. So while we haven't seen a marked decline in HP's performance, we've seen a marked increase and improvement in our performance. And that's where I think, net-net, we're winning the war or winning the battle. In addition to that, as we go to clients, when we speak to them, we speak to them about the entire offer: about BPO, ITO, Document Outsourcing and our technology base. And that conversation, as signaled by our signings strength and our backlog strength, is one that is absolutely on fire. It's a conversation that customers want to hear. So when we start talking to them about BPO and ITO, what we end up with if we don't get BPO and ITO, we actually get Document Outsourcing or Technology or all 3. So I think that the combination of the value proposition that we have and our strength in the areas that happen to be places that HP is not very strong maybe having an effect on them.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. Last thing to sneak in is on the cash question, I was surprised, Luca, you didn't mention that a bunch of big contracts are moving from investment to revenue mode, like the California Medicaid, as cash drivers for the fourth quarter is. Is that a big driver or is it not that material?", "Luca Maestri", "Well, it is significant. I said, Ben, that we are positioning the company for growth and that's what happens, right? You're starting up big contracts, and of course, they have some upfront cash requirement. But they're included in our numbers, right? We need to manage them. They've been a year-on-year negative for the first 3 quarters of the year, but they are included in our numbers.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And California Medicaid, fortunately, we can say, pretty firmly, is now starting to revenue. We are actually operating, it took a while, but we're operating California Medicaid as a real contract now. We generate revenue from it, et cetera, et cetera. So fourth quarter -- tail left 2 months of the fourth quarter and all of 2012, we'll see the benefit of revenue and then the flow-off of improved earnings from California Medicaid.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Ursula, in your prepared comments, you made a reference to the continued challenges on the government side of the Services business. And given that that continues to be an area of a lot of questions, I was hoping you could give some detail on government BPO signings year-to-date and what the pipeline looks like there and just generally, what you're seeing in terms of those particular customers' appetite or willingness to go forward with contracts.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. So let me -- I start this always when I get a question about the government with a statement that one of the things that I realize when I -- when we bought ACS, when we got them into our company was how important it was, is and was, for ACS to have strength in the government. A large amount of the revenue in BPO and ITO in the world is generated from government. And so our strength there is a positive, that I want never to be kind of overshadowed by some of the short-term issues. So overall, we're really pleased with our position in the government. What we are seeing though is we are seeing very similar to what we saw in the third -- in the second quarter with a little bit more emphasis on it. It takes longer time to get a contract signed, and after it's -- negotiated and then after it's negotiated, actually signed. And that longer time is not because of lack of desire for the services, particularly in the United States, some of the localities are still trying to figure out what their budgets are going to be and what authorities they have to make big go-forward commitments. Once they figure that out, then they sign. One of those that's currently active for us is New York State Medicaid, for example. Its one that's in competition. And everybody has done their bidding and we're just waiting for the State of New York to decide what to do once they figure out what they can do and what they have to do. So what we're seeing is we're seeing longer times, and then we're also seeing lower volumes with some of the services we provide. The most notable there is in unemployment, and this comes and it goes so we have a baseline unemployed number of people. And depends on what the government does to either extend or not extend that unemployment, the volumes go up or go down. So those are the places. We also have some contracts that naturally end, that we did the service for them and now it's over. They are -- they were very high-return contracts for us, very profitable contracts. And as they roll off, we have not only the revenue impact, we have the profitability impact. And you couple that with some really amazing start-ups with some very big contracts, California Medicaid is one, but there are others as well that are starting up that cause it to be, overall, the government segment to be lower performance this quarter than a year ago and lower performance this quarter than last quarter, than what we would expect. But on a go-forward basis, government is a strong segment for us to be in. And what we have to do is to continue to manage winning big contracts and manage the roll-off of contracts that naturally end and obviously manage our losses so we don't lose any that don't naturally end. I mean, it's a long answer to a question but I hope it -- volumes are lower, contract signing is longer and a little bit more complicated, and that's it.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. If I could ask a follow-up, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Of course, you can.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You mentioned worse performance than one year ago in the government BPO business. Is that a revenue statement or a contract signing statement or a pipeline statement or are all of the above?", "Ursula M. Burns", "It's a revenue statement. It's not a contract signing statement, but it's a revenue statement for sure, and it's down about 1% year-over-year.", "Luca Maestri", "Actually, bookings in government in Q3 were significantly higher.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. So signings a good revenue for roll-offs. And for others, roll-offs cancellations are down, particularly in Georgia and Texas is where we had 2 big hits. And the fourth quarter based on California Medicaid and other just natural flow-through of smaller contracts will be higher. Revenue will be higher, will be better for government sector in the fourth quarter, and we can just see that before this revenue in California is going to help that.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just one final quick one. In terms of volume sensitivity, are we talking about sort of low single-digit numbers here in terms of the impact on revenue growth rates based on things like changing unemployment claims? I would suspect.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, absolutely. That low -- yes. So it's a single-digit impact on us, low single-digit impact for us, but it\u2019s from a revenue perspective, yes.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "A couple of questions if I could. I guess, the first is going back to hardware. Ursula, I just want to make sure that I understand what the message is. You guys had pretty solid hardware results this quarter, fueled somewhat by backlog but your guidance for the December quarter is solid as well, and it sounds like you're saying you're through the backlog. You're also saying that the macro environment is having some impact to demand. So is the message that despite a bit softer macro environment, you're still delivering to what your hardware expectations were for the second half of the year? And then I have a follow-up next.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, the answer is yes. So if you look year-to-date, take out all the ups and the downs, we're about flat revenue on a year-over-year basis through quarter 3. And that's based on the macro environment and based on just the trends in this business. I think, we are on track to be where I would expect to be. Quarter 4, we expect to be essentially flat, total revenue for the Technology segment. And one of the things that Luca pointed out when he reported is if you look at Technology segment in 2 different buckets, one is just the equipment hardware that we report in Technology, and the other one is the total hardware that we report -- that we sell, some of which is wrapped around or wrapped -- Service is wrapped around it. And where we see the big pickup in quarter 4 is in our Document Outsourcing business and the technology associated with that, which comes into our P&L a little bit differently. As you know, it doesn't come in as equipment sale revenue. It comes in as annuity stream. Total-total, if you look at the activity numbers that we show, we see strength in mid-range color, we see strength in high-end color and we see strength in the total revenue -- reasonable performance in the total revenue for technology that we sell. So net-net, yes, things are looking not terribly. They're not looking terrible. They're actually looking pretty good on a competitive basis. We're gaining share across-the-board on a competitive basis as well. Equipment revenue share, we're #1 on just about everywhere we compete.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And is it really the MPS where you think you're driving share gains?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, there's MPS for sure, mid-range and very high-end. So those 3 segments are the places that -- very high-end, which has nothing to do with MPS, it has to do with strength of portfolio, iGen, color press. And then later on this year and early -- and into 2012, we will have the CiPress device fully rolled out. And then in the mid-range, some of it is cleaning up backlog but we just have a very strong portfolio in the mid-range and color. So we can -- those places, and then wrapping around in our lower-end product portfolio both in single function printers and in low-end MFPs, wrapping that around with our Services helps us there as well. So this one case that the strategy actually is working as we wanted it to work.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Understood. And I guess just a follow-up on Services. The revenue trends then, the pretty solid last couple of quarters and the bookings trends certainly saw nice improvement this quarter. The mix has been a little softer last quarter and this quarter, and I guess you walked through some of the dynamics in the government business. Can you talk about some of the other mix dynamics that have been a little softer in the other parts of the businesses? And I guess I'm just wondering what the gross margin implications could be over the next few quarters? And how long it could take to work through some of those mix dynamics?", "Luca Maestri", "So on the mix of services, you know that a very, very diversified portfolio, many different lines of business that have different characteristics in terms of growth rates and in terms of profitability. Some of them, take customer care for example, is a business that is doing extremely well for us. It was affected a bit by volumes during the third quarter, it very much depends on the level of economic activity for our customers than translating to volumes in our call centers, so there was some of that. But I would say the primary impact on our gross margin dynamics right now comes from government, both in services and health care. Services, Ursula talked about, in Health Care, we're making very significant investments that once we complete those investments, ramp up those contracts, example is California but we've got many other cases, we're going to have a platform for these type of contracts that is going to be really unmatched in the industry and it's going to put us at a very, very strong competitive position. So I think overall, Ananda, we continue to see some level of gross margin pressure in Services from -- purely from the mix and from the fact that we're making investments for growth. And so they will continue into -- in the near-term. But we think that when we look at the long-term and where we want to take the company, the fact that we want to accelerate our revenue growth rates, I think we're making the right decisions.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And with that, if I could add a point. The margin mix therefore that we see on a go-forward basis is on the -- towards the lower end of the range, definitely for quarter 4 and we'll update in January our quarter -- our 2012 numbers. But in -- but what we can see based on start-ups, based on volumes, et cetera, that will be in a gross margin range that's at the lower end of our range, tending towards where we are right now.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "30%, 30% to 35% range?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, 32-ish percent range, 32% to 35% range, yes.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Okay, got it. And then one last one on Service if I could. Document Outsourcing obviously is giving minimum last few quarters. It seems like, at least anecdotally, you guys are starting to get a little bit more excited about that. And you mentioned, I think in your prepared remarks, that you're seeing some pretty good increase in momentum there. Can you give us some sense of how big of a percent of revenue that can ultimately become? I think it's around 16% today. Can it become a 20% of revenue sort of segment over time or is that shooting too high?", "Luca Maestri", "So right now it's, I think you've done the math right, 16% total company, 33% for our Services business. We think that it's a segment within Services that can grow above average. And so you would expect it to trend up a bit in terms of -- it's relatively importance for the company.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And, Ananda, one last point if I can. I have a lot of last points today. One of the things about Document Outsourcing, the benefit that we're seeing from the services strategy that we have, the overall services strategy that we have, is that Document Outsourcing, while it's doing very well, is doing very well because it's a part of a set of offers that actually excites customers more. So we're getting a drag-along of that Document Outsourcing with the fact that we have BPO and ITO as well. And by the way, that's something that we talked about. And I think this quarter and a little bit of last quarter was the first times that we started to see that improvement, that synergy of where Document Outsourcing, BPO and ITO will win, will engage the client and will win 1 of the 3 of these lines to start with, and then we'll expand, we'll penetrate with one of those lines and then we'll expand. Document Outsourcing has benefited in the last quarters from that strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I had a couple also. Ursula, I wanted to start with you and go back to the strategy question. In Technology, the growth on a constant currency basis was about negative 1% with some help on backlog burn, so maybe it was negative 2%, but it was nevertheless a negative number. Your Services business is doing nicely, it grew about 5%. At the same time, in some parts of Services like ITO, you're very subscale, and in geographic basis, you\u2019re subscale in other areas such as Europe. My question is why deploy anything but the minimum amount necessary for the Technology side of the business and why not deploy the incremental capital towards the Services business? And in the past comments, you've talked about -- it sounds like you want to try to do everything, but I'm not sure why you're devoting incremental capital to Technology business? And then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think that we are devoting the appropriate capital to the Technology business. We have places in the Technology business that we are clearly privileged and that drives incremental profitability and cash. That is focused around color and around Managed Print Services, tightly linked to our Technology business. So we're not -- and as I think I've said in many calls before, we are deploying on a percentage basis and shifting significantly our investments towards Services, towards Document Outsourcing and towards BPO. So we are -- the reason why we'd invest any money is because there is money to be made in that segment of the business, and that's where we are.", "Luca Maestri", "Technology is a competitive space. It's a place where we generate a lot of cash, and so we need to continue to be competitive, so there is a certain amount of capital that we allocate to Technology. But when we look at all the activities that we have, acquisitions, we favor Services over Technology. CapEx, most of our CapEx is actually linked to services contracts. Working capital, primarily, it's -- we're deploying working capital to the Services contracts. So when you look at all the different lines -- and now, we're actually starting to deploy R&D towards services. We've got an R&D center in Europe that is totally dedicated to our Services business. So more and more, we're shifting every aspect of the company towards the opportunity where growth is. And you mentioned Europe. Europe is a place where, of course, we will deploy capital because we want to grow Services in Europe. It is a huge opportunity for the company. So I think, overall, I think we agree with you and I think we are following up with our actions.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I guess also I wanted to include ITO. I mean, it seems like as we look at the BPO market, increasingly technology is a critical element of BPO. So would your investments include trying to stimulate more growth in ITO which just had a couple of quarters of flat growth?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, definitely, definitely. And ITO is important for us as a stand-alone line of business and also because it provides us with capabilities that support our BPO and Document Outsourcing businesses, right? So we definitely want to make the right investments there.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Let me just ask my follow-up point or question, sorry. On the last -- the June quarter conference call or I guess it was July quarter conference call, the target for cash flow from operations was $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion. I think Ursula said on the prepared remarks was greater than $2 billion. I just wanted to confirm, what are the cash flow targets for the year?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think that Luca said very clearly, $2 billion to $2.3 billion.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, so it is the same cash flow targets?", "Ursula M. Burns", "It's the same thing, yes. Let me [indiscernible] and make sure that they all match. No, we didn't intend to say anything differently there. It's $2 billion to $2.3 billion.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Ursula, can you share with us some color on what renewal rates were in the Services business during the quarter? And how that compares to what you saw a year ago? And maybe if you could just break it down for us by service type, that would be very helpful as well. And then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula M. Burns", "So renewal rates were at 85%. They're back to our normal working rate. We had a low renewal rate last quarter, primarily driven by ITO, drop in ITO renewals, we're back to normal. We\u2019ve worked to make sure that back to normal wasn't an accident that we got back to normal. And so we will continue to be my prediction based on how we're going to manage it to be that 85-plus percent renewal rate next quarter and going into the future. What was the second part of your question, I'm sorry?", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was just wondering if you can break it down by service type. But I think your comment on ITO can answer that as well.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. ITO has recovered back to a good rate. It's generally lower than BPO and Document Outsourcing, but it's really high. It's in the higher 70% range. So we're back to normal.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, Luca, a follow-up for you. I don't see it on the slides, but how should we think about your comfort level, just with the outlook for 6% to 8% revenue growth and $2.6 billion to $2.9 billion of cash flow from operations for next year?", "Luca Maestri", "So Deepak, we will provide guidance -- update guidance for 2012 during Q4 earnings. When you think about revenue, clearly, we've got some revenue tailwinds that should improve our growth in 2012. We talked about California a lot. But the fact that our signings are strong, that will help, right? We also need to monitor them, the macro environment, because that has its bumps recently. Cash, again, we will have strong cash next year because we expect earnings to be higher. At the same time, clearly, pensions will become an issue for us and for any company that has got legacy plans. You know the interest rate environment drives lower discount rates that is obviously a negative for companies that have legacy-defined benefit plans. I don't want to get too much into pensions, but pensions will be a headwind versus where what we were thinking previously. So we're putting together our plans. We will provide you with updated guidance in January for 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "You've all been pretty clear on how we should think about volumes and the overall pace of business going into the fourth quarter in light of the macro uncertainty around right now. But can you comment on how we should think about competitive pricing, particularly within the Technology business for the fourth quarter and potentially into 2012? There are obviously some signs of incremental price aggression in certain areas of the imaging market and I'm wondering if you're seeing any of this flow into your core business? Is there -- or potentially flow into your core businesses if price conditions remain volatile.", "Ursula M. Burns", "We haven't seen a significant change in pricing trends from the previous quarters. It's 5% to 10% on our Technology business, and we expect that, that will be the same in the fourth quarter. By the way, all large contracts are competed for outside of that range that I just talked about, but the balance is that 5% to 10%. And on our Services business, we see -- the good news about our Services business, any of the 3 lines is that we sign upfront and we sign for the life of the contract, pricing with predefined escalators or de-escalators in those contracts. Occasionally, we get customers who are stressed, who want price concessions, and we negotiate with those contracts, with those customers openly and very willingly, and we generally give a price concession with something in return. So we're comfortable with that as well. So no significant changes to what we're seeing. I think everyone is dealing with the same environment that we are. So while it may seem logical that you would run down on price to get business, everybody's dealing with cost challenges that they have to manage and so they're staying fairly logical in their pricing, which is good. And we are as well, obviously.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then I guess a final question. Just sort of a basic question, I'm thinking about these new contracts in Services business. I know you've discussed it before but how should we think about the life cycle of some of these new contracts coming on? Because clearly, at some point, I would imagine that you're going to have this tilt towards these new contracts all shifting into profitability mode. I mean, how should we think about that time line? Should we assume that this is really a fairly near-term phenomenon and we start to see potential margin improvements and revenue uplift as well as we get deeper into 2012? Or is this something that's really just going to be a sustained phenomenon because you're pushing for growth, I'd imagine, over the longer term?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, the typical -- in fact, the typical -- the profile -- profitability profile of these contracts is fairly similar, right? You've got the upfront investments and then margin tends to improve towards the end of the contract. So in an environment where you're actually trying to promote some growth, you will see some kind of sustained margin pressure because the amount of new contracts that you sign is higher than your base, right, so you continue to require some level of gross margin dilution and some level of working capital investment. So I would say for the near term, for sure, I think we should be looking, for the company, for a gross margin range of 32% to 34% because of these dynamics in the Services business. But again, it is in the context of trying to accelerate our revenue growth rates from the historic numbers to something that is healthier.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And it's in the environment of expanding operating margins as well. So we leverage our SG&A and our R&D investments across a big event base and actually do some shifting to make sure that we can fuel that growth while continuing to expand operating margins. And the big, big, big, contracts are the ones that we're talking about here, I mean, it's California Medicaid, it's some of the pharmaceutical contracts that we are signing and the telecom contracts that are really large and long-standing. The good news about them is that they're long-standing, and the second piece of good news is that they're really large. And so these are really good business deals for us. We investigate them very clearly to make sure that we can afford them way before we sign them, that we can operate them before we sign them, et cetera, et cetera.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two questions if I could. One, Ursula, can you weigh in a little more how we should think about the Technology part of the business in terms of what the installs this past quarter imply for annuity growth next year? It does seem like it was kind of mixed in terms of the year-over-year install activity.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I think that the install activity will continue to stabilize and then strengthen our annuity revenue on a go-forward basis. This is install in both the Technology segment of the business and Services segment of the business. We're installing higher-end devices, mid-range color and production color devices really well, so that will help. We had some weakness in this quarter in the entry segment, just generally, the entry segment is generally lower everything: lower prices, lower post-sale revenue. We like them if we can get them, but we have lower activity this quarter. But overall, our install activity will drive more pages, stabilizing pages in color for sure, drives an average price of page up. It was up this quarter, it was up last quarter on a total company. So the install activity bodes well for the future, very well.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, Luca, I just want to get a sense here in terms of -- kind of build on some of the previous questions around cash flow. When do we get a sense that all of the new signings on the Services side over the past 12 months or so, when do we get a sense in terms of when the cash flow will exceed the initial cash outlays? I mean, how many more quarter does Xerox has to make these cash outlays to really build out the infrastructure before you start generating positive cash return?", "Luca Maestri", "I think, first of all, we will continue to sign new contracts so we're going to continue to have that issue that every time we want to start up a new significant contract that requires some infrastructure investments, we will have that. I think in general, what we're seeing is that some of these things drive some working capital requirements that were maybe higher than what we were anticipating. I would say that over time, these -- as we put some of these contracts into full mode, take California, they will become a positive versus the negative that they've been this year. But it very much will depend on future signings and how -- what the profile of those signings is going to be. Over the years, I think it's important to think about working capital as being fairly neutral as opposed to having had a couple of years in the past where working capital was a significant source of cash. And this is normal for a company that wants to grow a bit faster than we were growing in the past. And so that, probably, that's the way you need to think about it, maybe working capital as a wash and no longer a source of funds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I had a clarification and a follow-up. First, did you lower your near-term expectations for gross margins by about one percentage point? And if so, does that apply to next year as well?", "Luca Maestri", "So we are saying that in the near term, we think it's going to be more like 32% to 34%. We had out a range of 33% to 35%. So within that range, it's clearly a reduction, again driven very much by the fact that Services are growing and therefore there is a dilution of gross margin that comes from that and some of these new contracts as we said before. Again, getting into 2012 guidance, we will give you a full update in January.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So my question relates just to reconciling everything we've heard so far in the call and into that next year's outlook. Constant currency revenue growth, growth is tracking 1%, you expect that to accelerate. However, guidance implies something significantly faster. Meanwhile, you have this ongoing mix shift on the gross profit line. I guess my bottom line question is, do you believe you need to restructure and cut costs in order to meet 2012 expectations? And if so, are you willing to do that?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So the answer -- let me start and then Luca can add. We're being very careful to continually say one answer to a question that's been asked a lot of times, and that's what is our guidance for 2012? We've been very careful to say that we were going to update our guidance in the January in the fourth quarter of this year, the January report of that. The reason why is because we actually see tailwinds and headwinds and we want to get a better sense of how the fourth quarter will come out, and we'll have then been a better read of 2012 obviously. There are certain things that we know. One is that we are growing our Services business broader, better, faster, I don't know how to put it, than we thought we would. We are winning contracts, larger contracts. Those contracts that are good contracts. Those contracts require that we invest to start-up. The investment is in CapEx, as Luca talked about. And with more Services contracts, with more mix towards services, our gross margin will come down or is lower. So we see our gross margin 32% to 34% for the fourth quarter. I would suspect that we'll see it that way for 2012 as well, but we'll update you on that when we report the fourth quarter in January. We'll be able to give you a better, a more complete picture. The rest of the lines, we haven't really opined about at all for 2012.", "Luca Maestri", "But to your question on cost, Chris, absolutely. I mean, we're working on costs every day of the year. We work on cost on the product cost side. We work on cost on the fixed cost side of the business. Restructuring is a normal course of business. I mean, we're always looking for efficiencies and we're going to take the actions that are needed if we see that we can run our operations more efficiently than we do today, absolutely, we will do it.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thank you very much. Thanks for all of your time and for your interest, and have a good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or re-broadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3. We began 2011 with a clear articulation of our priorities. You see them listed here. While the statements themselves seem relatively simple, the complexity was in the implementations, especially during a year of unexpected external challenges. Here's a report card on how well we did. ", "First, accelerating our Services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings and expanding globally. More of our total revenue now comes from Services than Technology. In 2011, revenue from Services grew 6%, which reflects an impressive 8% growth in Business Process Outsourcing and 9% growth in Document Outsourcing. ", "Our IT Outsourcing business declined 4% during the year, but we're encouraged by our recent uplift in ITO signings. In total, our integrated sales activity resulted in a stronger pipeline and a 14% increase in new business signings. ", "Second, maintaining our leadership in document technology. We not only continue to hold our #1 equipment revenue share position, but we also grew share in 2011. We did this by offering a more extensive and affordable portfolio of color products and by expanding our distribution to serve more small and midsized businesses around the world. ", "Third, we are very good at managing our business with a disciplined focus on operational excellence. This gives us the financial flexibility to help offset pressures on the business whether it's economic uncertainty or necessary investments that drive growth. Either way, our focus is on delivering strong bottom line results. ", "And by executing well on the first 3 priorities, we delivered on the fourth, expanding earnings and returning cash to shareholders. Full-year 2011 adjusted earnings per share grew 15%. We generated $2 billion in operating cash and bought back $700 million in Xerox shares during the year. That\u2019s a buyback of 88 million shares or 71 million net of the pension contribution, which is more than we initially expected. ", "So during the year where we faced our share of headwinds, I'm pleased with our progress and confident in our position to build more value for our business, for our clients and for our shareholders in 2012. I often say that some companies talk about transformation, but we're actually doing it. You're seeing the results of the company's strategic shift in our financial performance. ", "But to understand how we are achieving these results, it's important to understand the breadth of our business. The Xerox brand is now in places that may seem unexpected, but the link between our well-regarded technology and our diverse services is one more common objective, which is simplifying for clients the way that work gets done so that they can operate more efficiently and more effectively. And as you would expect from Xerox, innovation remains core to what we do and how we strengthen our competitive advantage. ", "Turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. Radical changes to managing information in healthcare are now being more embraced by healthcare providers and payers. We continue to advance our offerings and be recognized as a valuable player in the industry through our cloud-based technology, our advanced security protocols and deep expertise in the complexities of building and managing digital health systems. ", "Two examples, 2 very good examples: one, with our recent acquisition of the Breakaway Group, which provides electronic medical record simulation technology, and our contract with the State of Iowa to run its health information exchange. Xerox innovation is also changing the status quo in some of the more basic ways that we live, like using public transportation. Through large-scale contracts with transit authorities, we're developing easy ways for commuters to pay with smartphones and debit cards, doing away with the inefficient token and ticket systems. ", "And no matter where you work, where you work takes you, in the office, on the road or at home, we help ensure that printing is accessible and affordable. We do that through continuously extending and refreshing our product portfolio, especially in color and by broadening our Managed Services -- Managed Print Services. Our MPS offerings continue to win the praise of industry analysts. More important, they win new business with clients like British Airways that recently tapped Xerox for a 5-year enterprise print services contract. In all 3 areas, we've developed repeatable, scalable and integrated solutions. This is our approach to real business, improving our clients' productivity by simplifying the way that they serve their clients. Our results in the fourth quarter reflect progress in these and other areas. ", "So please turn to Slide 5 for a review of Q4 performance. In the fourth quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.33. That's up 14% from a year ago. Our GAAP -- on a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.26 per share. This includes $0.07 related to the amortization of intangibles. Total fourth quarter revenue of $6 billion were flat. Revenue from our Services business was up 6%. However, revenue from our Technology business was down 5%. While our Technology business improved throughout the year in the United States and in developing markets, we saw a drop-off during Q4 in Technology sales across Europe. ", "The strength of our Services business model is particularly evident when we're faced with macro issues. Our Services provide cost-efficient ways for our clients to run more productive enterprises, and our multiyear Services contracts benefit our business for the long term through a healthy base of recurring revenue. ", "Signings for BPO, Document Outsourcing and IT Outsourcing were up 15% in the fourth quarter. The increase in Services signings continues to put near-term pressure on margins as we make initial investments to implement new contracts. As a result, operating margin of 10% was down 0.4 points. Gross margin was 32.2 points, in line with our range. And we balance our investments by continuing to improve SAG, with selling, administrative and general expenses now at 19.3% of revenue. ", "Q4 cash from operations was approximately $1.3 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we delivered on our commitment to generate $2 billion in full-year operating cash. We're continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase. In a moment, Luca will provide a more detailed -- more detail on cash flow, as well as review our balance sheet and reporting segments. Then we'll both take your questions. ", "But first, let's look -- take a little closer look at our top line results on Slide 6. Here you see what -- that Services now represents 48% of our total revenue, up from 45% a year ago and continuing to grow in proportion to our total revenue. It's an important metric that reflects investments in building our outsourcing portfolio and expanding our offerings globally. ", "As I mentioned, total revenue of $6 billion was flat in the quarter. Annuity revenue, which is 80% of the total, was flat or up 1% in constant currency. Equipment sale revenue was down 3% or 2% in constant currency, largely due to the weakness in Europe. While operating in this challenging economic environment, we've grown our global market share for equipment revenue. And installs of Xerox equipment grew 8% in the fourth quarter, a good indication of future annuity. ", "During the year, we launched 27 products, with an emphasis on broadening our color portfolio for both production and office markets. And we've -- and we expanded our channels of distribution. As a result, our MIF, that's machines in the field, for our color devices grew 14% in 2011, an important contributor to our annuity stream. ", "Growth in Services is also a big benefit to our annuity. We continue to focus on joint sales activities between Xerox and ACS. In 2011, this resulted in more than 300 revenue synergy deals, delivering significant total contract value for the company. These deals include a multiyear contract with a major consumer goods company, to manage their  IT Systems, and enterprise print services win with a large financial investment firm and expanding our business with one of Latin America's largest banks to now support their commercial foreign exchange operations. ", "To further accelerate our joint sales activities, we increasingly see the value of going to market as one Xerox, demonstrating to our clients that our Services-led, Technology-driven strategy offers value to their business through the strength of our offerings, the power of our innovation and the expertise of our people. ", "Therefore, we're retiring the ACS brand in many areas of our Services business and will lead with Xerox as a master brand that now represents the world's largest enterprise for business process and document management. It's more than a logo change. It reflects the progress that we've made in transforming the company, the meaningful growth in front of us and the value we\u2019re building for stakeholders. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. As Ursula just explained, revenue was flat in the quarter, both at actual and constant currency. Services continue to show good growth, up 6%. And Technology was down 5%, affected by the weakness that we saw in Europe. ", "Operating margin in Q4 was 10%, a sequential improvement from Q3, in line with seasonality, but down 0.4 year-over-year. Gross margin of 32.2% was lower year-over-year due to the shift of business towards Services and the ramp of new contracts. We expect this gross margin dynamic to continue in the near term as Services growth accelerates and new contracts start up. ", "We partially offset the gross margin impact through disciplined expense management. Both R&D and SG&A ratios continue to show significant improvement from restructuring and synergies. Within SG&A, bad debts increased year-over-year by $12 million, as improvements in North America were more than offset by higher write-offs in southern Europe. ", "For the full year, operating margins grew by 30 basis points. We deployed several cost and expense reduction initiatives to offset the disruption from the natural disaster in Japan during the first half and ongoing currency headwinds. Below the line, we had improved results from lower interest expense and higher equity income at Fuji Xerox. ", "Also, in the quarter, we made 2 one-off entries which are worth mentioning. We realized a $66 million after-tax pension curtailment gain that is associated with our decision in Q4 to fully freeze after December 2012 any further service and benefit accruals in the Xerox defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. This impact was partially offset by a restructuring charge of $39 million after-tax we took to improve the efficiency of our operations and help counter the pressures in the macro environment. ", "As a result, adjusted EPS in Q4 was $0.33 and grew 14% year-over-year. The only adjustment to reported EPS was the amortization of intangibles. It should be noted, this adjustment was higher than in previous quarters because in Q4, we accelerated the amortization of the intangibles related to the ACS trade name, following our decision to discontinue the use of the ACS brand going forward. For the full year, adjusted EPS grew 15% and GAAP EPS more than doubled. ", "Let us now move to the Services segment on Slide 8. The 6% revenue growth in Services is a reflection of the breadth and diversity of our portfolio. Within Services, BPO growth accelerated, it was up 8%. And Document Outsourcing was also up 8%. ITO revenue was down 6%. The 8% growth in BPO came from both commercial and government. Commercial growth was driven by financial services, customer care and recent acquisitions. Government revenue growth came primarily from the ramping of the California Medicaid contract. The 8% increase in Document Outsourcing reflects both the impact of strong new signings and benefits from our partner print services offerings, which began to be reported in Document Outsourcing this year and are accelerating. The competitiveness of our product portfolio and our unique document management software and tools continue to clearly differentiate us in the marketplace. ", "ITO revenue was down 6% in Q4, driven by 2 main factors: past contract losses and lower product resale revenues. On the positive side, during 2011, ITO signings were at $3.4 billion and up by more than 150% year-over-year. The impact of a few contract losses will continue to have an effect on revenues through midyear, at which time the ramp in new signings will deliver revenue growth. ", "Total signings for the entire Services business increased 15% year-on-year in Q4, and the trailing 12-month signings calculation is now flat, even after including the California Medicaid new business and the Texas Medicaid renewal, both signed in 2010. ", "Our pipeline continues to be healthy and is up 5%, including synergies. Segment margin of 10.3% was down 1.7 points year-over-year due to the contract startup costs and lower renewal rates we just discussed. California Medicaid alone impacted margins by over 0.5 points. We expect this margin pressure to remain in the near term but to gradually improve as we move through 2012. ", "Let's now turn to the Technology slide. Technology revenue was down 5% or 4% at constant currency. The largest factor in this decline was the slowdown in Europe where equipment revenue was down 15%. It should also be noted that as planned, our Technology results are impacted by the launch of our partner print services, which have been very successful and are reported in Document Outsourcing. ", "In spite of the revenue decline, segment margin of 11.7% was flat year-over-year and at the highest level for the year in line with seasonality. Overall, a good result, thanks to strong control and expense control. ", "Looking at our product segments in detail. Entry install performance improved in the quarter, although revenue was impacted by price and mix. We're building momentum in this segment with the recent launch of a new price-competitive platform providing both mono and color capabilities. Entry represented about 21% of our Technology revenue. Mid-range was the strongest performing area in Q4 and for the full year, thanks to our strong color portfolio. This is the product segment that was also most impacted by the disaster in Japan. As we had expected, supply availability has now returned to normal, and the backlog, while healthy, is not artificially high due to the product constraints. ", "Mid-range accounted for 57% of our Technology revenue. High-end results were mixed. With continued strong performance in production color, driven by iGen4 and the 800/1000 Color Press, we're also improving our performance in entry production color with the recent launch of our Xerox 770 system. High end represented 22% of our Technology revenue. ", "Going into 2012, we're very confident in our Technology offerings, given our market share gains and recent improvements we have made to our industry-leading portfolio. ", "Moving on to our key metrics on Slide 10. Our most relevant operational metrics this quarter were quite positive. Total Services signing of $4.2 billion were up 15% year-over-year, with over $1 billion of signings in each of the 3 lines of business. For the year, we signed over $14 billion, flat year-over-year even with the 2 large Medicaid deals in the prior year compare. New business signings for the year were up 14%. ", "Looking at the Document-related metrics, please keep in mind that these include the Technology segment, plus Document Outsourcing. Total color revenue was up 2%, both actual and constant currency. Digital machines in field continue to grow, was up 3% in total, 14% for color-capable devices. Lastly, digital pages were stable and down 3%, with pages from color devices up 9% both in Q4 and for the full year. All color segments showed strong install growth, and total installs for the company were up 8% in the quarter. This did not translate into equipment revenue growth, even [ph] price erosion and mix impacts, but this will feed annuity over time. ", "Moving on to the cash flow slide. Cash from operations of almost $1.3 billion was in line with Q4 of 2010 for a full-year total of $2 billion. Earnings contributed $383 million. And consistent with normal seasonality, working capital during the quarter was a source of $696 million. For the year, working capital was essentially flat. ", "Pension cash contributions in the quarter were $78 million and $426 million for the year, which is about $200 million higher than our 2010 funding. We expect a similar level of pension contributions in 2012 due to a very significant drop in the discount rate in spite of truly outstanding returns that we achieved in 2011 on our plan assets. ", "CapEx of $134 million was in line with the annual trend, and we had limited M&A activity during the quarter. ", "Let us turn to the next slide to quickly review the uses of our operating cash flow in 2011. So we generated $2 billion of cash from operations. CapEx came in as anticipated at $501 million full year. And the resulting free cash flow of $1.5 billion was used as follows: we paid down over $600 million in debt, and we have now repaid the debt we took on for the ACS acquisition. We ended the year with $8.6 billion of debt, of which $6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.9 billion. ", "We also had $265 million in dividend payments, and our current yield sits at approximately 2%. Our focus was to deploy our available cash primarily towards the share repurchase program. As mentioned earlier, we repurchased $700 million worth of shares at an average price of $7.97. We also continue to invest in tuck-in acquisitions, spending $212 million full year, primarily in Services. ", "Let me now move to guidance for 2012. For revenue growth in 2012, we are guiding to 2%-plus at constant currency. We expect Services to grow mid to high single-digits with growth accelerating throughout the year and Technology to be flat to modestly lower, given a macro environment and our strategy to lead with our Managed Print Services offerings. ", "We expect GAAP EPS in the range of $0.97 to $1.03 and adjusted EPS in the range of $1.12 to $1.18. The change in guidance from May of last year is driven by a pension expense increase of well over $100 million because of the significant decline in discount rates, negative currency dynamics and worsened economic outlook in Europe. ", "Our earnings estimate would put us in a position to deliver strong cash flow between $2 billion and $2.3 billion. This is also lower than we were assuming back in May of 2011 due to 3 main factors: revised earnings as I just explained; pension funding in line with 2011. This is $200 million higher than previously assumed due to the historically low discount rate and restructuring payments of approximately $150 million instead of an earlier assumption of nominal payments. We took a $61 million restructuring charge in Q4 and anticipate taking a modest amount of additional restructuring in 2012. This will allow us to improve our operating leverage and offset some of the cost pressure in the environment. ", "We expect operating cash flow to be negative in Q1, with higher pension contributions adding to the typical working capital seasonality. On CapEx, we're planning for investments of $500 million, which will result in free cash flow of between $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. ", "Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. In 2012, we expect to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1 billion worth of shares, skewed to the second half of the year, consistent with our cash generation seasonality. We are announcing today that our board increased the share repurchase authorization by $500 million, so it now stands at over $1.3 billion. ", "We anticipate spending between $300 million and $400 million on acquisitions, with primary focus on expanding our Services offerings. And dividends are planned to be a use of around $300 million given current payout and number of shares outstanding. ", "With that, I would turn it back to Ursula to wrap up.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. 2011 presented its share of challenges, and our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflects our operational discipline in delivering strong bottom line results while scaling our Services business and maintaining our leadership in Document Technology. ", "Signings continue to grow for our diverse services offerings. Installs are up for our industry-leading technology. Both of these areas contribute to a healthy annuity stream that serves us well for the long term. In the near term, we are planning for continued economic weakness. So we're being somewhat guarded with our expectations and remain focused on operational efficiency. ", "For the first quarter, our expectations are for adjusted earnings of $0.21 to $0.24 per share, including $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. And as Luca noted, we expect full-year adjusted EPS of $1.12 to $1.18. ", "Throughout 2012, our productivity initiatives will be balanced with making the necessary investments to expand our Services business and aggressively pursue growth opportunities in key markets around the world. And our business model will continue to yield strong cash flow. We're confident we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the skilled leadership team and a disciplined focus on execution to build on our progress. ", "With that, I thank you again for joining us today, and let's open it up to questions for Luca and me.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Luca, given the lower cash flow estimates and the pension being $400 million-plus in terms of funding, do you plan to issue more equity like you did a quarter or 2 ago to fund the pension? And is that an option to you? And what would be the offsetting share count impact?", "Luca Maestri", "So Ben, yes. Pension contributions are going to be, in total, similar to what we've seen in 2011. So at this point, even though we have not made a final decision, we are planning to issue stock in a similar size of what we've done in 2011. Bear in mind that the contributions to the pension plan this year is going to be skewed towards the first half as opposed to the second half as we had last year.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Is there any benefit to issue equity and be buying back stock at the same time rather than just fund the pension with cash and then just buy back less stock? Is there a reason that -- to go through the motions of buying back stock while you're issuing equity?", "Luca Maestri", "The reason is the same that I talked about last year. It really gives us a bit more flexibility with our cash. It allows us to be more consistent in the market as we buy back the stock. And frankly, particularly because these contributions this year are so skewed towards the first half, we want to make sure that we retain appropriate cash balances throughout the year.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can you just recap how many shares you issued in the last tranche? This is 16 million, right?", "Luca Maestri", "16.6 million shares.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. So that -- when you say similar size, maybe you do it a few times like that.", "Luca Maestri", "We would be looking to do -- I'm talking about the absolute amount that we're talking about, right? I mean, last year, we did about 130 million. It's probably going to be a similar size. And obviously, the amount of shares is going to be depending on the share price on that day. But we're thinking of doing one single contribution in stock.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Then my follow-up issue is with regard to cash flow. So it sounds like you were at $2.6 billion, $2.9 billion in cash flow from ops. Now we're at $2 billion to $2.3 billion, so call it $600 million of a difference. You're going to issue some equity for pension, so it sounds like pensions may be $200 million of the lowered cash flow from the May. Can you talk about where the extra $400 million in lower cash flow is coming from now if I'm right on the pension?", "Luca Maestri", "You're right on the pension. And if you remember, when we were talking at the Investor Conference back in May, we gave guidance on earnings of $118 million to $128 million. So that's come down. So we got about $200 million in earnings there. And I think when you think about earnings, you need to think about currency, you need to think about the economic outlook for Europe. And also the pension expense itself is $100 million higher than we were expecting at the time. So we got about $200 million in earnings, $200 million in pensions. And restructuring, we're going to be doing a bit of restructuring. We talked about $150 million of restructuring in 2012, but we were expecting only nominal payments back in May. So that's the rough math, Ben.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So that gets us to the $600 million. And then with all that, my final question is, okay, we know about 2012 now. You just went through the bridge, really. Does 2013 have a snapback now if we have flattish cash flow this year slightly up? And then due to all these headwinds, where current rates are today and best we know, without giving earnings guidance or anything technically, do we have a snapback in cash flow next year or do similar factors keep it flattish next year?", "Luca Maestri", "The one thing that I can tell you right now, all else being equal, that pension is necessarily going to be a tailwind going into 2013 and '14 and '15. So we are at a point where you've got discount rates which are historical lows given the dynamics of our pension plans. We've now frozen future service and accruals, so we kind of capped the exposure there. We've had great a return on assets on the pension plan during 2011. So if discount rates do not come down further, then you could have certainly well over $100 million just from pension moving forward. And then of course, we're going to be trying to grow the business and all the other things that should bring additional earnings into the company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "My first question is with regard to Europe. Ursula, can you give us a little more color on sort of linearity during the quarter, where you specifically saw some of the weakness? And have you seen any changes as we've entered 2012?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So on linearity, it's got worse as the quarter went on. If you recall last quarter, we spoke about Europe, and we were guarded because we still had positive results in Europe or good results in Europe where we knew -- we were suspecting that something would happen. It started to happen in the early parts of the quarter, and it definitely continued throughout the quarter. And I don't see any -- foresee any significant change in either direction in Europe. That's the way that we're planning. We're planning for continued weak activity in Europe. So linearity, yes, it got worse as the quarter went on. And it's all over Europe. Obviously, southern Europe, the Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, et cetera, are worse than the rest of Europe, but we do see weakness even in the stronger countries where decisions are delayed and activity is a little bit lower, et cetera, et cetera. So we do see a significant change in Europe. Interestingly enough, balance that off against what's happening in Europe, in United States in developing markets, developing markets were strong throughout the year. It had up and down based on war here or war there but strong business throughout the year. In the U.S., as the year went on and we implemented changes and kind of rationalized, our coverage got better every quarter -- every month and every quarter. So we see a relatively strong, on the equipment side, U.S. business and a strong developing market business offset by weakness in Europe.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, great. And can you talk a bit about the Services business just in terms of the contracts that you've signed, the 14%, I think, or 15% year-over-year increase in signings? Like what type of contracts are you signing? Where are you seeing the strength? And maybe talk a little bit about ITO as well.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. So think about Services signings almost across-the-board. So we've signed in the public sector. We've signed transportation contracts with -- in Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, for example, which we announced earlier. We signed in a private sector with airlines, with banks. So we are seeing a broad range of signings primarily in the U.S., obviously, which is where most of our business is, but we also have signings in Latin America in developing markets and signings in Europe. As we spoke before, Europe is in the BPO business, and the ITO business is the smaller portion of our business, the smaller portion. And we did a change in strategy at the end of the third quarter, in the third quarter, to move an executive there to actually manage, stickhandle our European business, which is particularly important now because we're seeing some headwinds in Europe, not yet in the Services business but we want to make sure that we start up that business with the right cost base in mind. So across-the-board, signings everywhere, it's really good. ITO signings were unbelievably strong. We are managing ITO. The ITO business is one that clearly we're learning about as we go through more and more. ITO signing, as you know, we have some cancels from last quarter that are hitting us on the revenue side this quarter. We also have a business in the ITO that's a resale business, the equipment resale business, that while good, should not be our major focus and will not be our major focus on a go-forward basis that also puts some pressure on our revenue. So our purpose with ITO is twofold. One is to actually accompany the rest of the business that we have and make us felt more relevant in the rest of the business to Document Outsourcing and the BPO business. But in and of itself is to get around these things that you're now hearing, the vernacular sick [ph] verticals, where you're not just selling a bunch of technology, you're not just selling some software, you're actually trying to sell a solution around the vertical market. Healthcare is the most obvious one to talk about. It's one that we're spending the most time on. So ITO, what we're doing with ITO is repositioning it. Focusing on longer-term, more higher-value engagements with our clients, focusing on -- assuring that we renew. This is a problem that should not exist. Renewal should not be a problem for us, and it was in quarter 3 and would have been in quarter 4. So we're focusing on actually changing that and making sure that we actually have value with our clients and intimacy with our clients. ITO should be good.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay. And then my last question is just sort of more of a philosophical one. As you think about the fact that you're getting strong growth from services and good signings but it's clearly impacting the margin a little bit with the pressure that you're seeing in Europe, how do you sort of balance and think about the investment required on the services side versus the growth, given some of the macro trends that are out there?", "Ursula M. Burns", "It's a great question, by the way. And the way I would think about this ", "  is to think both in the short- and the longer-term, right? So in the short term, we have to make sure that anything that we sign falls within a set of parameters that allow us to deliver it with high quality and not sink our financials, right? So we get lots of deals proposed. Some of them would not be good if we took them in the beginning. If we did a lot of California Medicaid, I said this over and over again, we would be having a significant and broader problem. By the way, the good news is to winning at least 1 or 2 or 3 Medicaids because they are big and foundational for our business. So what we do with signing is we look to make sure that we can operate them well, that we can actually stand them up, that we can deliver the revenue, the SLAs, the revenue and the profits that we want and have strong margins. That's in the short term. In the long term, we try to make sure that we have platforms that are repeatable, that lightens the load. We stay close to our customers that keeps our renewal rates high, and we continue to expand outside of the areas that we have today to continue to grow our services offerings. So the way that we think about services, it is an engine for growth. And if we and when we operate it well, it actually does fuel the growth that we're seeing today, 6% growth even with a very poor ITO revenue quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "My first one, I guess, is on operating margin. There was an explicit operating margin guidance for 2012, and it feels kind of flattish, I guess, after we adjust for the share buyback. But I just wanted to confirm that and get your thoughts.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, Ananda, to confirm, I think we're planning around operating margins to be flat to slightly up. As you go through the year, probably, they're going to be accelerating throughout the year because you're going to be seeing better growth as we go through 2012, but flat to slightly up.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Okay, great. And I guess just sort of follow-up to the Services comment you guys made. The BPO signings, I guess, just optically appear to be a bit light, particularly after last quarter. Were they in line with your expectations or were they, in fact, light? And if they were light with the strength in ITO signings, does that maybe push out some of the ramp to margin expansion as you move through this year and maybe even in the '13?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So Ananda, signings were a little -- BPO signings were a little bit light. But then, I mean, they were not significantly off, nothing to panic about. They were a little light. We had a huge signings quarter, as I said, up, and as Luca said, up 150%. And some huge number in ITO and Document Outsourcing remains a strong thing. I wouldn't -- I don't see any real issue with BPO signings. It's bumpy, it comes -- they come and they go, and we're focusing on them. So they should continue to come.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And Ursula, would it tend to shift your thinking around the roadmap to operating margin expansion over the next year to 2 years given the mix of the Services signings?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I don't think so, but...", "Luca Maestri", "So if I understand the question correctly, Ananda, we -- as we look at operating margins, we know that in the short term, we've got a number of pressures. Pension is one, currency is another one and obviously some weakness in Europe. At the same time, we have a number of tailwinds, and obviously, we want to capitalize on those positive factors. We got the very strong signings that we bring in from 2011. We got a Technology portfolio which is market-leading. We've gained share in every geography of the world. And obviously, in share repurchases, we'll have a bit on earnings. And we will continue to do tuck-in acquisitions. So as we think about it longer term, longer than 2012, of course, it's our aspiration to continue to grow operating margins.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Last one for me. Just regarding the comments about the restructuring that you'll be doing as we move through the year, can you give us some sense of how we should layer those into our quarters in terms of earnings just so we get the linearity of earnings appropriately set?", "Luca Maestri", "Well, let me give you the Q1. I think we said $0.01 to $0.02. They are part -- it's part of our guidance. We said $0.21 to $0.24. You should model $0.01 to $0.02 of restructuring. As we go through the year, we'll see how much we're going to be doing. It really depends on the environment and many other factors.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Could it top out at $0.02 or should we almost certainly expect something beyond that as we move through the year?", "Luca Maestri", "It may round up.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Luca, I wanted to ask just on the -- for the guidance. For the sale of the IP that happened in Q4, did that get recognized in Q4 or is that more coming in calendar year '12? So that will be -- is that included in the guidance as well?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, it's included in the guidance, Keith, and we've got it well laid out in the MD&A. The majority of the sale was recognized in Q4. I think the profit impact was about $16 million. But then we've got smaller amounts in '12 and '13 because of the way we set up the arrangement.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. So could I say that the amount in '12 and '13 is relatively -- I mean, it's not material to the guidance?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, again, in the MD&A, it's $12 million and $8 million, respectively, to the guidance.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Then let's go to -- well, let's go to -- then to -- in the EPS forecast. Could you give us your underlying assumption for operating tax rates, please?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. We are guiding at 29%.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. You've been consistently coming in below that. Okay. Well, we'll go with 29% then. Then on -- perhaps this is for you, Ursula, if I could. The operating margins, just confidence that, that works its way through. I think it's understandable that as you ramp new contracts, it's a bit tougher for the new contract versus the maturing contracts. But just confidence that you're going to be able to manage that margin sequence, particularly in ITO where those renewals, I think, has been a bit tougher than you anticipated.", "Ursula M. Burns", "So, I mean, it is the operative question and the place that we spend a significant amount of our focus, Keith. We are confident. I mean, we're confident, as confident as you can be before you do it. We have mapped it, we know the customers in ITO. It's all around renewals here, right? Because the signings are coming, we know the ramps, we don't have any really egregious contracts, large contracts that are outside of California, in which we already are comprehending for sure, that will take up a significant amount of investment before we get revenue so that we have a normal kind of layout of contracts. And so our focus is going to be on renewals. Our renewal rate overall is a little bit lighter than normal. BPO is a little bit lighter, but fine, Document Outsourcing not really that relevant. The big place that we have to spend a lot of our attention is in ITO, and we are doing that. So we're getting the business, and now we're managing the customers to assure that we stay intimate with them. And if there is a nonrenewal, it's because the customer no longer needs the service versus they are not pleased with our service delivery.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Yes, you just hit my -- my follow-up on that one would be, to say it a different way, you're not losing those ITO renewals on price? It's just the customers, say, insourcing?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. Price is generally not the issue here. There are 2 -- there are 3 reasons why you can move. Obviously, one is that the customer doesn't need the service anymore, they in-source or their contract is just done. The second one is price, meaning -- or some other competitive type thing, price or terms of conditions, which will end up in price. And the third is the outright loss. I mean, you compete with somebody and they say, \"I like Joe better than Peter. And I like Xerox better than someone else.\" The place that we have to make sure we continue to focus, price is not going to be our issue. We will manage price. If we want to win it, we will win it. If it looks good in the long term, that's not the issue. It's all around assuring that we continue an even level of contact and service with the clients and making sure that they understand that we are in their camp. It's basic customer care. We will -- we are -- we've taken a really big focus on this in the ITO business, and we'll continue to do that, which will drive up the business. Clearly, price has something to do with everything, Keith, everything.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay, fair enough. I'm going to ask one more philosophical question, particularly for you, Ursula. If I look at your layout on Page 13 -- Slide 13, excuse me, about 25% of your available cash for 2012 is targeted to acquisitions, with the balance towards share repurchase. And I just wanted to know, kind of an IBM type of question. Is that how you think about the model over the next number of years? Or is there any kind of comments or color you could give that we should be thinking longer term?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I think the way that we should think of it, for '12, clearly, the plan, as laid out in Slide 13, and the philosophy, pretty much the same as happened in '11. The way that you should think about '13 and beyond is along the same bucket. So clearly, we are going to use our available cash to buy back shares, think about the dividend, so that type of shareholder return, acquisitions and dividend. But the mix may change, depends on a lot on the price of the shares, what's available in the marketplace. Right now, we're using a disproportionate amount of our cash towards share repurchase, and it'll -- it may change. But it will not be so far different. So we'll not walk away from share repurchases, still a very valuable tool for us and very lucrative for the shareholders. So we'll continue to do that. And the whole question is around the edges, [indiscernible] one way or the other.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Okay. Well, I'd encourage you to think about mix more.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to, I guess, not to beat a dead horse but go back to the Services margin decline a little bit more and maybe try to ask the question differently. You've always said that 5% to 10% was sort of the right -- well, I think it's fair to say that you said 5% to 10% was the right growth rate to think about for the Services business, and yet the margins are coming in a little lower year-over-year. So I just wanted to see if you could help us parse out how much of that is new contract ramps, how much is contract run-off and how much is price pressure. And then I have a follow-up.", "Luca Maestri", "I'll give it a try, Richard. We have been -- when you think about the dynamics of gross margins, clearly, they came in on the Services side slightly below what we were expecting. And I think the issue has been around the combination of contract ramps, which were pretty much included in our projections, and renewal rates, which were below the historical ranges. So we've always talked about renewing at about 85%, ideally, aspiration into 90%. Our renewal rates have come in, in the low 80s for the year. So that's where you really see that level of gross margin compression that we want to avoid going forward.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And in light of that, Luca and Ursula, could you talk about the right way to think about operating margins for Services for this year and, I don't know, maybe even philosophically for 2013?", "Luca Maestri", "I would say, for 2012, we -- probably during the first half, we're going to be seeing a continuation of what you're seeing during 2011. But we believe that we're going to be improving margins in the second half because there's going to be an acceleration also in the revenue growth for Services. And then as we go into 2013, of course, again, our aspiration is to grow margins all the time. But we need to recognize that if growth accelerates and we end up winning very large deals like we've done in the past, for example, with California, this is something that in the short term, because they're so sizable, will have an impact on margins. But as you look longer term, they become profitable contracts, and they expand our position in the marketplace.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then one other question for me, and that is, was there any meaningful benefits from Japan expedite expenses going away in the fourth quarter? I think that had been a meaningful drag for you earlier in the year. Could you talk about whether that was a benefit in Q4 and whether there's any residue left there or we're back to 0?", "Luca Maestri", "We've had very minor expenses related to the disruption in Japan in Q4. It wasn't a big issue. So quarter-on-quarter was obviously a slight positive. I like to step back for a second and talk about operating margins for Technology for the year. We were up in Technology 60 basis points in operating margins in spite of all the disaster from Japan, in spite of currency. I mean, the yen is more than 30% higher against the dollar over the last 3 years, in spite of the weakness in Europe. So I think if you step back and you look at our performance in Technology in terms of preserving margins, I think it's been admirable.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. If I can sneak one more in, Ursula, have you seen any movements on supplies pricing in the marketplace? We've heard from some contacts out there that there are general price increases going through on the supply side here in January and February, and I'm wondering if you're seeing that and whether you think that, that could potentially benefit Xerox here in Q1.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Through to Q4, just earnings period, we didn't see any. And we've heard the same things that you've heard. And we'll look around and see how we're positioned competitively. And if we have space, we'll take it. If we're positioned in a place that allows us to take price up, we'll do that. We want to stay competitive to the marketplace, we want to make sure that we continue to gain share. And so we'll look at the marketplace out there. And if we can fit it in, we'll do it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I have a question on the Services division as well. Specifically, drilling down on some of the challenges you're having with renewals, can you help us understand exactly how you address those challenges, particularly this year? And from your prior experience, how much control do you really feel you have over this dynamic? And I guess, really, what we're trying -- what I'm trying to get to is, can you give us some assurance that this isn't a sign of an emerging problem with competitive positioning or anything?", "Luca Maestri", "So we have -- Bill, we got a long history around renewing contracts and particularly ACS, but also on the Document Outsourcing side. And we've always been in a range of 80% to 90%. And clearly, our target is to be 85% to 90%. What we've seen during 2011 has been a specific issue around renewal rates exclusively in our ITO business. And it's been related to 3 or 4 meaningful contracts. It hasn't been a widespread loss on renewals. It's been specific -- 3 or 4 specific situations, different reasons. At the same time, we have signed up significantly more than what we've lost. So the net-net of the 2 things, the growth in signings versus the loss of renewal is clearly a positive that we'll translate into revenue growth, we believe, starting from the second half of 2012. So there isn't anything systemic that we're concerned about. And I would say that having grown signings by 15% year-over-year actually tells us that we are quite competitive in the marketplace. If you exclude the California and Texas contracts that we signed in 2010, mega deals, very specific events, actually, our signings are up 40%. So we feel very, very good where we are in the marketplace. We've had specific circumstances in ITO. It's about customer engagement, and that's what we need to work on.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that makes sense. And then a final question, I know we're getting towards the end here. On cash flow, if there are any further downward surprises, whether it's macro or whatever it may be, or mix, at what point, just trying to gauge the risk here, what point do you have to be more constrained with your cash usage in terms of the share repurchase plans in particular? Is there a line in the sand that you're looking at where you'd have to step back a bit or where it would make sense to step back a bit? Or do you feel fairly comfortable at this point that you've really factored in all the risk to this cash flow outlook?", "Luca Maestri", "Just to be practical, and we've included this in our, of course, in our earnings range, we will be doing most of our repurchase activity during the second half of the year. So we're going to have much better visibility. If something happens, any collapse somewhere else around the world, we would be dealing with it. We don't need to make a decision right now. We feel, at this point, given all the puts and takes, we feel very confident that we can deliver on this capital allocation strategy. Of course, at any point in time, we can revisit. It's very difficult for us to get ahead of ourselves because most of the activity will happen towards the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two questions, if I could. I want to get a sense, if you can kind of give us some context, you've been kind of a perennial cost container or restructuring type company and very diligent in that process. But are we getting close here to starting to cut into too much muscle with this next round of restructuring and probably more restructuring down the road if the macro worsens?", "Luca Maestri", "I can assure you that we got plenty of opportunities, plenty of opportunities in our product costs. We have really a gold mine there in terms of removing complexity, reminding [ph] the portfolio, rationalizing components. And again, we have a significant infrastructure. It's a legacy infrastructure. We're not near the end. I mean, we'll continue every day that we come to the office to look for efficiency in our operations. If we can get revenue growth, that efficiency will go into the revenue growth. If we cannot get revenue growth, that efficiency will go towards cost reductions.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And this muscle or things like research, our selling resources, our customer engagement, that's muscle. And I think what Luca is saying that while everything is needed -- a lot of things are needed to run the company. There are certain things that are really hard to rebuild if you take them away. We are not focusing on those areas. Those areas, for as long as we've done restructuring, that, to the 2000 time, have been protected and exalted because we know it's difficult to get them back. But we have a lot of cost in this company. And as the world changes, we're going to have to actually morph the cost to actually be more appropriate to where growth is coming or just remove it from the company. And that's the path that we're on.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Then my second question is around cash flow. Clearly, it's been a hot topic for investors over the past year, and I kind of share Keith Bachman's sentiment here. I'm trying to figure out if your cash usage is being applied appropriately here. And what I mean by that is we've been hearing now for almost 2 years about all these signings, and eventually, we're going to get the revenue and thereby the cash flow. But I hear more about BAND-AIDs and I do really about return on the cash flow here. And I'm just wondering if you need to maybe jump-start the acquisition machine to really get that cash flow and the return on the cash flow work in the right direction over the next 12 to 24 months.", "Luca Maestri", "I don't know where to start. I think we are making the investments that we believe are appropriate. We're looking at acquisitions in a very disciplined manner. ACS has done it consistently. We keep doing it even now. And so we look at attractive returns on our acquisition investments. And so we're going to be looking at the opportunities. We bought 16 companies during the course of 2011. It is very important for us that our cash flows are sustainable for the long term. And so sometimes we get asked why our cash flow has come down a bit versus past expectations. And one of the reasons is because we put a lot of investments into the business, and sometimes they don't come through acquisitions. Sometimes they come through a new large contract, like California, for example. So maybe there's been a bit of a shift between investing acquisitions versus investing in the organic business. But again, I think we look at it from a return on capital perspective, and that's the way we actually assess our investment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the sustainability of Technology margins. Specifically, I'm interested on what you're seeing from a pricing standpoint on equipment. It sounds like you've turned a bit more aggressive on equipment to drive some unit placements. How does that flow through to margins over the next couple of quarters, number one? And number two, is it fair to say that you have gotten more aggressive in order to drive those unit placements?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think that you can look at the unit placements from 2 different perspectives. Price, we're still in the range of 5% to 10%, price erosion on a year-to-year basis, maybe a little bit higher this quarter, at the higher end of the range than in the past but not anything outside of that range. Big driver here is mix. Mix is -- mix in all of the categories, entry, mid and high. If you look at the product sets that we've been very successful on and the products that we've launched, these 27 products, they're skewed towards the lower end of the mix range, the price range. So we get lots of activity, we'll get good post sale, but the revenue doesn't necessarily map to it in the short term because the prices are lower. I think that the margins for the Technology business, connecting it to the previous conversation that we just had, the previous question, are -- I mean, we're in a range where they are sustainable, they take work, take work to get there. This is where we manage cost and expense continuously, simplification, et cetera, et cetera. But I do believe that they are sustainable, and I think that we're showing good results from that.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. Just to add to that. So as we get into 2012, I just said 2011 was very good for margins in the Technology business. We actually expanded margins despite of all the pressures. We continue to have currency issues, and we continue to have pension expense issues for 2012. And so that will put some pressure on Technology margins, and that is the reason why we're talking about efficiencies and we're talking about restructuring and we keep managing it. But I would say, net-net, when you look at Technology, we are industry leader, gaining market share, expanding margins. I would say that it's a testament to the quality of our products.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "First, just a clarification, if I could. I just want to confirm that your revenue guidance for the year does include the impact of acquisitions, which I expect would probably add a couple of points of growth in itself.", "Luca Maestri", "That includes acquisitions, Deepak.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Luca, if I can just follow up on Europe. Can you remind us of your revenue exposure to Europe in the Technology segment? And x Europe, can you give us a sense of growth in the Technology segment in the fourth quarter? And maybe just talk us through your expectations for the year, both for Europe versus x Europe.", "Luca Maestri", "So Europe in total is about -- we're exposed about 20% of our revenue base. In Technology, just to give you a sense, Deepak, equipment revenue for the company was down 2% in Q4. It would have been up 2%, excluding Europe. So both the U.S. and DMO were solid in Q4, and we definitely saw the weakness in Europe.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's really helpful. And then maybe lastly for Ursula, in the Technology segment, can you give us an update on where you are in terms of just expanding distribution, particularly to reach SMB-type customers? And any metrics that you can share around contribution to the overall Tech segment revenue and perhaps growth that you saw in your SMB revenue last year would be very helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, expanding distribution is just something that has been very successful for us. I think it's showing up, by the way, in the U.S. revenue dynamics and the activity dynamics that we just talked through. The performance of the Tech business, without Europe, would have been up, which is a change for us, which [ph] has been on and off. We have, I think, a solid footing now, primarily focused on the products and the expansion of distribution. So it's worked out fairly well. We have everything that comes available that is good for us to tuck in, we tuck in. My -- I don't think I've said this publicly before, but after a while, you ran out of things to buy. I don't know if we're quite there, but we may be getting there in the Tech side. So a lot more of our acquisitions will be focused on Services as we go forward. We'll pick up the odd SMB distribution capacity in United States. So good news across-the-board, I think that we've done as much as we can do with a little bit around the edges to expand it, and we'll be focusing on Services in a go-forward basis.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox.", "[Operator Instructions] ", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3 with a review of the strategic imperatives that define our business and align with our financial performance.", "First, accelerating our Services business, growing it faster by diversifying our offerings; aggressively pursuing opportunities in key growth areas like HR outsourcing, customer care, transportation and health care; and expanding globally. In Q1, revenue from Services grew 10% in constant currency and now represents more than half of our total revenue.", "Second, maintaining our leadership in Technology. Our Printing business continues to benefit our bottom line and remains core to our business model. We are focusing investments on innovation that drives down the cost of color printing, and we're expanding distribution to extend our reach to small and midsized businesses. We made good progress in Q1 with installs of Xerox products up 7%. According to recent external market share reports, we remain the leader in equipment revenue share for the ninth straight quarter. In fact, we're taking share from competitors, strengthening our leadership position.", "And third, driving operational excellence across our enterprise. This means adjusting our cost model so we're competitively advantaged and have the financial flexibility to quickly adapt to changing marketplace needs while scaling in key growth areas.  During Q1, Services margin pressure was partially offset by a 5% decline in selling, administrative and general expenses.", "By executing well on these 3 priorities, we're delivering on the fourth, creating value for our shareholders. Doing so by growing revenue, delivering solid earnings and allocating capital in the areas of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase. So our execution is well aligned with our strategy and is reflected in our performance.  But the heavy lifting is in the details. Since acquiring ACS more than 2 years ago, we're making a seismic shift in our business. It's not just in how we operate, but also in what we do and for whom we do it, all driven by the diversity of our offerings. As a result, the Xerox brand is now in places you wouldn't expect and serving industries where our relevance extends way beyond printing.", "For example, just in the past 2 weeks, we've been part of the conversations at 2 major health care conferences: TEDMED and the World Health Care Congress. At both, we were acknowledged as playing an important role in simplifying the business of health care through electronic medical records, health information exchanges and digital protocols, all of which help lift administrative burdens for providers. Our technology, like advanced imaging, tends to enable these activities, but our deep expertise and customized outsourcing offerings make up the total solution. Please turn to Slide 4 for more examples of what I mean.", "We read in the headlines that governments need to be more efficient, but we don't often hear how that is happening each day. For example, last month, the State of Texas announced an $848 million contract with Xerox for a significant overhaul of their IT systems that will simplify and greatly improve the efficiency of the state's operations. We're consolidating 28 data facilities into 2 centralized centers, modernizing one of the largest IT systems in the country with improved cloud services and overall security and disaster recovery capabilities. And while deals like this get a lot of attention, cloud services are not just built for large enterprises. Through our new cloud-based platform for small and midsized companies, SMBs benefit from the same infrastructure investments that we make for our largest clients. For all of our clients, large to small, data security is paramount to maintaining the integrity of their operation. That's why we teamed up with McAfee and Cisco to help secure the -- ensure the security of data across every touch point, our PCs, in servers, in the cloud, all the way through to the output on multifunction printers. With this technology backbone, our services to industries like health care take on an even more relevant position. When we're dealing with patient data and the complexities of modern-day pharmaceuticals, all of our innovation, from Digital Nurse Assistants to customized medication packaging, is based on strong security protocols and infrastructures.", "That's a quick glimpse of the stories behind the numbers. We'll share more with you each quarter, and hopefully, these examples will begin to reframe your perception of Xerox, showcase the amazing opportunity that's in front of us and better explain the evolving nature of our business mix and model.", "Let's look at how this translates into our financial results. Turn to Slide 5. I'll provide a top-level review, then Luca will take you through the detail. I'll close with our expectations for quarter 2, and then we'll take your questions.", "Slide 5. In the first quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.23. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.19 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Earnings, which are flat from a year ago, are in line with our expectations and reflect the investments that we're making to grow our Services business.", "Services revenue was up 10% in constant currency, and revenue from our Technology business declined 5%. In total, revenue of $5.5 billion was up 1% and 2% in constant currency. Technology revenue was impacted by the continued weak macro environment, the timing of when distributors purchase supplies and by clients increasingly shifting to Xerox's Managed Print Services, which is reported in our Services segment. Demand for our industry-leading management services led to a 7% increase in revenue from Document Outsourcing. ITO revenue was flat, an improving trend from prior quarters, and revenue from Business Process Outsourcing grew 13%. Total signings in the quarter were flat on a trailing 12-month basis, which is what we expected considering the absence of any megadeals during the 90-day period.", "All in all, I'm quite pleased with our growth in services and the benefit it brings to our top line growth, all while contributing to our business for the long term through a healthy base of recurring revenue. Yet in the near term and as expected, we're facing pressure on margins as we make initial investments to implement new service contracts. As a result, operating margin of 8.5% was down 6/10 of a point and Q1 gross margin of 31% was down 2 points. This is in the range of our expectations for the first half of this year, and we balanced our investments by continuing to improve SAG, which is now at 19.4% of revenue compared to 20.5% a year ago. Q1 was a use of cash of $15 million, again in line with expectations and reflecting the seasonality of our cash flow. We remain confident in our guidance to generate $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash, and we're continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchase.", "Turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at our top line results. Q1 2012 is the first quarter where Services represents more than half of our total revenue. At 51%, it's up from 47% a year ago, and it's an important metric that reflects investments in building our outsourcing portfolio, expanding our offerings globally and the shifting mix of our business. As I mentioned, total revenue of $5.5 billion was up 2% in constant currency. Annuity revenue, which is 85% of the total, was up 2%. Equipment sale revenue was down 1%. We're still seeing weakness in Europe, although it has moderated for the fourth quarter -- from the fourth quarter of last year. Sales in the U.S. were stable in a competitive environment, and we're seeing initial benefits from our new sales coverage strategy. Our wholly owned Global Imaging dealers are focusing on midsized clients, while our direct sales force becomes more exclusive in pursuing enterprise level technology and MPS opportunities.", "In our developing markets, we had a strong quarter in equipment sales, reflecting the strength of our channel distribution and competitively priced color devices that serve small and midsized businesses. ", "And as I said earlier, all this activity led to a 7% increase in installs of Xerox document technology, building up the number of Xerox machines in field, what we call MIF, is a good indicator of future annuity growth. Our approach is to lead in color so Xerox ink is being used to generate the color pages printed in workplaces of any size.", "During the quarter, our color MIF was up 13%. Growth in Services is also a big benefit to our annuity, taking complex business processes and simplifying them results in a major win for us and meaningful savings for our clients. For example, with Gartner and IDC giving Xerox a top ranking for our leadership in Managed Print Services, we're able to sign large-scale MPS deals like the one that we announced recently with WellPoint. We're saving WellPoint more than $3 million a year by consolidating 9,000 document devices into a lot fewer multi-function systems We now -- We've now assumed full management of California's Medicaid program, a massive undertaking and a milestone as part of our 10-year $1.6 billion contract signed in 2010. It's the nation's largest Medicaid program, serving 7.5 million people, and we\u2019ve processed more than 90 million claims, totaling $7.5 billion just in the past 6 months. ", "In Europe and Latin America, we are expanding our sales and activities and services capabilities. We're signing new business like the recently -- like the recent multi-million contract to manage call center operations for a large IT organization and one for a global tech manufacturer. We are an extension of their customer care operations, the voice over phone and over the web to support their clients\u2019 needs. These and hundreds of other examples represent our real business and the business problems that we're solving for clients. They bring us value in annuity revenue, they bring us incremental growth opportunities that boost our bottom line, and they prove the sustainable success of the new Xerox.", "With that let me turn it over to Luca. I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula. Good morning, everyone. First, I'll just cover revenue, and of course, we were pleased with the acceleration in Services, and we expect it to continue. Technology was lower but should show decline improvement going forward because Q1 of 2011 represented the most challenging compare of the year for us.", "As we expected, gross margin was lower, 200 basis points year-over-year. Two main drivers for the decline. First, half of the impact can be attributed to the Services margin compression due to the ramping of a significant number of new contracts, along with a few higher margin contracts running off. Second, the increasing Services mix also drove almost 1 point of decline. The gross margin on our Services business is half that of our Technology segment. So the strong growth in Services has a direct impact on overall gross margin. We continue to drive cost and expense efficiencies with SG&A improvement of 110 basis points, which went to partially offset the gross margin pressure. As a result, operating margin was down 60 basis points. We expect both gross margin and operating margin to improve as we move through the year and, by Q4, expect to see year-over-year improvement. The restructuring of $17 million was $32 million higher year-over-year and is fully reflected in our adjusted results. Adjusted EPS of $0.23 was flat from 2011, with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.", "Let us move to the segment slides. We have updated the content of these pages to also provide a trend view of our results. Starting with Services, we see a very positive trend on revenue, with 10% growth in Q1 at constant currency. This is driven by the strong signings we have had the past 2 years. The California MMIS deal we are ramping contributed to about 1 point of growth. Even without that, we would have seen significant acceleration with good contribution across all lines of business, both government and commercial. In particular, government and commercial health care and financial services began the year very strongly. Signings in Q1 were lower year-over-year and flat on a trailing 12-month basis, which is not abnormal after the second half that was very strong for us and reflects the fact that we had no megadeals signed in the quarter. New business signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 12% and drive our revenue growth. We anticipate Q2 will be a stronger signings quarter given our pipeline. As important as signings are renewal rates, which were within our target range of 85% to 90% for our combined BPO and ITO businesses. We have highlighted the pressure on Services margin the past few quarters, so the Q1 results were not unexpected. The largest factor is the ramp of new contracts, which we estimate is 2/3 of the margin decline. The main driver of the remaining impact comes from loss contracts, specifically ITO from prior periods. We track margins down to the contract level, and we're taking actions to improve the profitability of those contracts that are in a start-up phase. Given the accelerated growth, we expect the Services margin pressure to continue, but we see sequential improvement as we move through the year and year-over-year margin growth by Q4.", "Let's now turn to the Technology slide. Technology revenue in Q1 was down 5% at constant currency. Two main factors drove this performance. The largest impact came from unbundled supplies revenues, which were down 8%. Unbundled supplies represent a little less than 20% of our Technology revenues and are predominantly aligned with entry products. They can be volatile, given channel inventory dynamics, which is what we saw this quarter, and they were facing a difficult compare because Q1 of 2011 was the highest supplies revenue quarter of the year. We expect supplies revenue to be closer to flat for the rest of the year. The second and important factor is the continuing impact from the launch of our partner print services offering. This has been very successful and is helping to fuel the Document Outsourcing growth. At the same time, it does shift revenue from Technology to Services. From a geographic perspective, Europe was weak but improved sequentially. Trends in North America and our developing markets were roughly in line with last year, absent the supplies decline. Segment margin of 10.5% was down slightly from 2011 but reflected continued cost and expense control and a good performance when considering the lower supplies mix. The most recent market share results show that we continue to gain share on an equipment revenue basis, and we expect to continue to build on our leadership position in 2012.", "Moving on, I'll comment briefly on the key metrics slide. Total Services signings of $2.2 billion were lower year-over-year and are flat on a trailing 12-month basis. As mentioned previously, we did not have any megadeals in the quarter, but the pipeline remained strong, and we expect to have a good Q2 quarter in signings. We add a renewal rate to this slide as it is an important metric for us and one we want to give more visibility to. In Q1, it was 86%, which is in our target range. Looking at the product-related metrics, please keep in mind that these include the Technology segment plus Document Outsourcing. Total color revenue was flat at constant currency. If we exclude color printers, which is where we saw the supplies impact, color revenue would be up 3%. Digital machines in field continue to grow and was up 2% in total and 13% for color capable devices. Digital pages show a stable trend, were down 2%, with pages from color devices up 10%. Installs were strong with good growth in all color segments except printers, which was down, driven by lower OEM sales. We saw strong growth in A4 color multifunction devices and entry production color, both areas where we've recently launched new products. We also continue to see growth in midrange color. Install growth did not translate into equipment revenue growth, given price erosion and mix impacts, but this will feed annuity over time. ", "Moving on to the cash flow slide. Cash from operations was in line with our expectations and was a use of $15 million, which compares to a use of $30 million in 2011. Earnings contributed $276 million, and consistent with normal seasonality, working capital during the quarter was a use of $635 million. Cash contributions to our global pension plans in the quarter were $79 million and, combined with the $130 million stock contribution, resulted in total funding in Q1 of $209 million. As mentioned last quarter, the timing of pension contributions this year will be skewed towards the first half. Balance of the year, we expect to contribute approximately another $350 million to our pensions, all in cash.", "In terms of investing cash flow, we've spent $128 million on CapEx and $87 million on acquisitions. Dividends paid were $63 million, and we repurchased $50 million in stock. We continue to guide for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating cash flow for the year, and we continue to plan use available cash to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1 billion, for the year, weighted towards the end of the year.", "Let us turn to the next slide to quickly review our capital structure. Our Q1 ending debt balance increased to $9.6 billion. Given favorable market conditions, we issued $1.1 billion of notes in March to pre-fund the $1.1 billion in senior notes which come due in May. From a maturity standpoint, we maintained a well-balanced debt ladder with just about $1 billion coming due annually. During the course of the year, our debt balance may change moderately, given the timing of our cash flows, but we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing of customer leases. Of the $9.6 billion debt balance, $6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.8 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.", "In summary, Q1 is seasonally a lighter results quarter, but overall, we came in as expected, with a standout positive being the Services revenue acceleration. Our #1 challenge is to improve Services margin. We're very focused on this objective and see this as an opportunity, going forward, in terms of future earnings expansion. In terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to return value to shareholders through share repurchase, dividends and accretive tuck-in acquisitions.", "With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Q1 results were as expected. We have work to do on improving margins while we're scaling services growth through the ramp of new contracts, expanding globally and increasing revenue with existing accounts. In Technology, our focus on competitively advantaged color systems and broader distributions led to strong Q1 install growth and double-digit color mix growth. We're disciplined in managing expenses, giving us the flexibility we need on margins to support our Services growth. We'll see a sequential improvement in margins throughout the year and continued benefits from operational efficiencies. Our guidance on cash remains unchanged as we remain committed to investing in share repurchase throughout the year. For the second quarter we expect adjusted earnings of $0.25 to $0.28 per share. This includes a $0.01 or $0.02 of restructuring, and our full year earnings expectations continue to be an adjusted EPS of $1.12 to $1.18.", "You've heard me say this before, but it bears repeating. Some companies talk about transformation; we're actually doing it. Our results this quarter and our expectations for the balance of this year reflect the shifts happening in our business. They're all centered on building a sustainably successful enterprise with a healthy annuity stream and significant growth opportunities. We're making progress on every front and I remain impatient to make even more. I'm also confident that we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the skilled leadership team and the disciplined focus on execution that will deliver more value for you and for all of our stakeholders.", "With that, I thank you, again, for joining us today. As we get into your questions, I know that you'll want to dive deeper into Services. So this quarter, I asked Lynn Blodgett, the President of Xerox Services, to join us for the Q&A. On occasion, we'll bring in other members of the senior team during our investor webcast. This way, like me, you can appreciate the breadth and the depth of the team that helps me lead this business.", "Now let's open it up to your questions, and I'll field them and ask Luca and Lynn to chime in as well. Questions?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "I guess my first question, Ursula, is if you could talk just a little bit more about what you're seeing in Europe and perhaps some of the other geographies. I know you mentioned that it was improving a bit, sequentially, but I'm curious as to, on the various segments and that, what you're seeing both, like I said, in Europe and other geos.", "Ursula M. Burns", "All right. So Europe was weak, but we did see modest, light -- modest improvement this quarter, particularly in equipment sales line and clearly in the areas that we're focusing on, color, throughout the spectrum, from small to large. Modest, very modest improvement there. But Southern Europe, weak; the rest of Western Europe, a little bit better than Southern Europe; and the Eastern European nations, which are reported in our Developing Markets Operations, generally stronger than all of the rest of Europe. In North America, we saw a continued trend from the fourth quarter, which was a little bit stronger than throughout the rest of 2011, which is good. So we didn't see any downturn there at all. We did see a little bit of weakness in supplies, primarily driven by timing of pricing increases and OEM sales, that kind of thing, but nothing systemic at all there. DMO, continued strength throughout the regions in DMO. Just about every place that we do business, we're seeing growth as those economies grow. We see SMB everywhere around the world doing better, particularly in our North American operations where we have a particular focus in moving coverage. We're seeing our Global Imaging operations do even well there. By the way, Fuji Xerox is having a good result as well, particularly in China and the Asia-Pac areas that they cover. That's also seeing growth. So I think that -- Services, by the way, one last is Services, in Europe in particular, we're starting to see expansion there, which is very good. It's still a very small portion of our business. But we're signing contracts, and as we go forward and get more traction there, we'll be able to actually call it out to you more specifically. As I told you before, Services in Latin America actually were stronger to start off with, particularly in our transportation segment. So across the world, we didn't see a significant change, except for in Europe, a little bit of pickup from a very depressed level and particularly in equipment sales.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then, Lynn, since you're joining us, can you give us some of your perspective on Services? What segments you're seeing growth in, what you're hearing from your customers and then perhaps how you're thinking about sort of the margin improvement and how it should sort of progress through the year.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "You bet. The areas that we're seeing the most activity in would be in health care, both government and commercial health care, for obvious reasons given the pressures that everybody feels on health care costs. Our customer care area is continuing to grow very strongly. We have some great new tools that we're going to implement there that we think will even make us even stronger in customer care. Financial services is very strong. HR outsourcing, we've really sort of disciplined ourselves, and we're much better at focusing on point solutions. So those things are all helping us to grow strongly in those areas. Transportation, as Ursula mentioned, is very, very strong, and transactional BPO just continues to rock along. It's just a very strong operation. As far as the margins, obviously, the fact that we have as much new business, which we're obviously very excited about, as much new business growth, that is going to put a certain amount of pressure on margins. If you look at the decline in Services this last quarter, about 70% of it was due to new business startup, and half of that was driven by the state of California, and about 30% of it was driven by the fact that we had last year, as you know, lower than we like renewal rates, especially in ITO. So we're seeing some impact from that. The vast majority of the pressure is coming because of new business signings. So we're confident that we're going to see -- we like the new signings, and we'll see nice incremental kind of growth through the year in margins.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Great. And then just my last question for Luca. Can you talk a bit about how we should think about the yen and FX as we go through the year in terms of contribution versus the hedging programs you have in place?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, Shannon. Let me start with the impact on revenue because I think it's important to highlight, also, the effect on revenue. It was a negative 1% in Q1. We expect it to be a negative 2% on revenue during the second quarter because euro was particularly strong last year. But for the full year, we expect currency to be 1 point negative to our growth rate. When you go down to the profit level, directionally, as you know very well, for us, weak yen and strong euro is the best of both worlds. At this point, at the beginning of the year, we had talked about $40 million to $50 million negative for the year when we started the year. Rates had improved marginally. So now with that, you probably -- the impact is $30 million to $40 million for the year, and that's the way you need to think about it. We are fully hedged for the current quarter. We tend to be hedged 60% to 70% for next quarter and then at different levels for the following couple of quarters, again, and so the whole concept of the hedging program is to smooth out the volatility of the exchange. But this is the type of impact that we should be seeing this year, at current rates, of course.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Richard Gardner with Citigroup.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'd just like to address the current supplies inventory correction that you talked about. Can you talk about what prompted that and where we are and how comfortable you are, right now, with inventory levels? And just any additional color would be helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, we are really thrilled with the activity levels that we saw in the quarter. They were up 7% in particular, and the entry level was up 9%, which definitely fuels the supplies revenue. I'll turn it over to Luca to talk a little bit more about the supplies revenue details.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So last year we had some fairly significant price increases at this time of the year, and so we were facing a very significant compare year-over-year. Obviously, this is a revenue stream that is very affected by the levels of inventory in our channel partners. I think that the decline in Q1 will not be repeated going forward. What we think is that supplies revenues are going to be closer to flat for the rest of the year, and so I think we're going to work through this issue starting from Q2, Rich.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, Rich, if I can add. I wouldn't read a whole lot into this correction. If you followed us, which you have for a long time, you'll see, depending on the timing of pricing changes by us or our competitors, you'll see ups and downs. It's a fairly lumpy revenue line for us, so you'll see ups and downs. We're seeing great activity, great installs through all of our channels partners, through all of the lines that we get to the market through. So the expectation is that with those equipment sales, there will be supply improvements. So I would not read a whole lot into this correction.", "Richard Gardner - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could follow-up quickly. I believe the restructuring charge on the Technology side was smaller than you talked about previously. Correct me if I'm wrong, but could you talk about why that's the case? And I think, Ursula, you had suggested that there's potential for Technology margins, operating margins, to actually be up this year for a variety of reasons, and I'd just love to get your latest thoughts on that.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Turn it over to Luca\u2026", "Luca Maestri", "Yes, so the restructuring charge may be a shade below what we thought at the beginning of the quarter, but we still see a lot of good opportunities across the enterprise. So in the guidance that we give you now for the second quarter, again, we're talking about additional opportunities for restructuring. It's just, I think, a timing issue. Nothing more than that. On the operating margin side, as we said, we believe that from this point, we're going to start seeing sequential improvement year-over-year, both in Services and in Technology. And that will take us to a point in Q4 where we're going to have, we believe, good year-over-year improvement. When you do the math, we think operating margins should be flat to slightly up for the year, but with some level of revenue growth, of course.", "Ursula M. Burns", "If I could just add one last point. Since we will see higher equipment sale revenue in Q2, the margins for the Technology business will be a little pressured. As you know, the margins on our supplies are significantly higher than the margins on our equipment. But at the end of the day, it'll all balance out in the year. So it's literally just a timing issue. So nothing more there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Could you just talk a little bit more about Services margins? What are you specifically doing to get them up? And what kind of trajectory should we see going from the 9.3? How quickly -- it sounds like you need to be well into the 12s by the end of the year to hit your numbers. Is that right? And what you specifically doing to get there? And how does the margin play out sequentially? Just for that line.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I'll have Luca like walk you through it, and then maybe Lynn could add something, some color needed.", "Luca Maestri", "So, yes, 9.3 for Q1. We see the expense sequentially, Ben, as we go through the year and getting into an improvement, a very significant improvement, year-over-year in Q4. Really, the reason is clearly the fact that we are ramping a lot of new business all at the same time. Very large contracts, State of California, that's a big example. And also the fact that we are ramping off some of higher margin contracts, particularly in ITO, some of the losses that we had last year. We essentially follow these contracts, and I'll let Lynn expand on it, but we follow all these contracts at the granular level, so each one of them. And we got specific actions for all of them, starting from California, but all the other big ones that we're starting now. I think it's just going to be the way that we go through the year, that some of those pressures are going to mitigate as we actually get these contracts to a steady state.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, the natural thing that happens to a contract, whether it's in start-up mode or through its life, is that the margins continue to improve. And so as the contracts that we have, the big things that hit us in terms of margin pressure, those things will continue to mature, and their margins naturally improve. So you're going to see a natural, in fact, a progression in margins because the contracts that we're currently focused on are going through that life. We haven't seen anything that is unusual as far as the kind of start-up costs that we're seeing. We are doing a number of things we think to continue to drive margin improvement. We have some tools that we've developed. We have a product called Simplicity [ph] that will help us a great deal in our customer care area, and we are shifting a lot of our work to platforms. Our new MMIS platform that was a significant investment is the kind of thing that will help drive higher margins. And of course, as Ursula said, we're just focused on operational excellence. That's our daily bread and butter. So we have to never take our eye off that ball.", "Ursula M. Burns", "If I can just add, to wrap this one up. Losses, this is a place we actually have a lower renewal opportunities -- set of renewal opportunities in the quarter, actually, and throughout the year is actually good news for us. So there's less chances that we can actually lose a contract. But even on the contracts that are up, all the contracts that are up for renewal, we are on them, meaning executives are engaged, the operational managers are engaged and we're engaged with the leaders of the other companies we're doing business with, to assure that they know that we're paying attention to this. So I think you heard that we are focused on the normal operation of the business. We're focused on contract renewals. We're focused on tools to simplify the business, and we've modeled this out, and we're pretty confident that we'll be able to see the margin expansion, very confident that we'll see the margin expansion throughout the year with a high point in margins in the quarter -- at the end of the year, in the fourth quarter. So one of the reasons why we gave you the additional detail on Slide 8. It's a little bit dangerous to put out but we decided to put it out to show we'll continue to fill this in throughout the year, but we'll be able to show you how the margins are improving on a sequential basis.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Deepak Sitaraman with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Ursula, for the full year, can you speak about how you're thinking about the revenue growth outlook? Is there any change to your 2% top line outlook for 2012?", "Ursula M. Burns", "No, we're sticking to the 2%-plus revenue outlook, driven by the mix of business that we saw. High single-digit growth in the Services portfolio, BPO, ITO, Document Outsourcing together and still a little bit of pressure, so flat to slight declines in the Technology business. This is all at constant currency, of course. So we're seeing -- we see that still coming through. Any kind of upside that we do see, we'll actually pass on in future guidance, but we really don't see that changing. High single-digit on Services and flat to marginal declines in the Technology business.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, I guess, just to follow-up then, on that high single-digit outlook for Services. Just given the trends that you're seeing in terms of pipeline growth and signings on a trailing 12-month basis, can you speak about the level of visibility you have there?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I'll have Lynn take it. But I'll summarize before he starts. We have a fair amount of visibility on the revenue side in Services, but go ahead, Lynn.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, the pipeline is, even though we have record, very strong record bookings the last 2 quarters of last year, the pipeline continues to grow. And in fact, it's up 5%, notwithstanding those very strong bookings. So that gives us great visibility in terms of ramp. Growth, right now, is driven by the ramp of signings, primarily the signings that we had last year. One of the great things about this business, because it's so oriented to recurring revenue, is that you can pretty well predict that, if you have a pipeline, it's going to translate into a certain amount of bookings, and then those bookings will contribute very, very predictably to the revenue growth. So we feel really confident in the ongoing revenue growth.", "Deepak Sitaraman - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, and just maybe the last one for Luca. Luca, you mentioned margins, overall, could be flat to up slightly on a year-over-year basis for the full year. Is that commentary appropriate for just Services margins as well?", "Luca Maestri", "I think it's going to be -- yes, overall. But keep in mind that we also have the other segment, which is also helping. So, yes, but pretty close to that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I had a balance sheet question for Luca, specifically around your buyback on a medium- to longer-term basis. You've committed to buying back $1 billion of stock this year. How should we think about that as an ongoing commitment? Should we expect buybacks to continue in 2013, 2014 at this type of scale?", "Luca Maestri", "Very clearly, we will have a place for share repurchase on an ongoing basis. As we think about capital allocation, we want it to be well-balanced. Clearly, there is going to be room for dividend and possibly a consideration for the dividend increase as we go forward, and some element of acquisition that is very important to our business model, particularly on the Services side. So we will -- as we get towards the end of the year, we're going to have the Investor Conference in November, we will give you a full debrief on the way we're thinking about capital allocation. Certainly, for the remainder of the year, it's what we mentioned. And clearly, going forward, it will remain. Particularly at this level of the stock valuation, it will remain a very significant element of our capital allocation strategy.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Do you think that the commitment to the buyback is limiting your opportunity set on the M&A side? In other words, do you think you're missing out on opportunities to accelerate the growth of Services given the size of the buyback commitment?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Absolutely not. We have a pipeline, an active fishing and pipeline net out there, and anything that we see that fits into the parameters that we buy, we operate on. So I do not believe -- more than I do not believe, I know that we're not limiting our M&A opportunities because we're buying back shares.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And my last one goes back to the issue around supplies and the recurring elements of the Technology business. I mean, we've been hearing about pretty strong MIF growth for many quarters now, yet that doesn't seem to be translating into the annuity revenue stream, and now we're actually seeing downsides on supplies usage. So can you help me understand the disconnect between past growth and MIF and continued declines on the recurring elements in tech services?", "Luca Maestri", "There are 2 primary elements to that. Obviously, there's an element of price erosion that -- it's there, it's in the market and we know that, that causes some pressure on revenue. And the second one is mix. Mix is big as well. We're seeing -- particularly the way we've launched products recently, we've seen very good growth in installs in our entry segment, which obviously carries different levels of pricing. And so I would say those are the 2 reasons from a pricing and mix perspective. And obviously, we've had a macroeconomic environment in Europe which has not helped in that respect.", "Ursula M. Burns", "If I may, Chris, add another piece here. If you think about our business, the way that we\u2019re reporting it today, we report activity to you. That activity is from our Technology business and from our Document Outsourcing business. We just don't -- it makes sense to do it that way. That's the total activity. The revenue splits between the Technology business and the Document Outsourcing business or the Services business. If you were to take into account, in the Technology business, the revenues from the services that we now book in Services, the Technology revenue would have been down 2%. That is almost totally attributable to the weakness that we see in Europe. We offset everything else. Prices up, down; activity, up; colored pages, up; digital pages, we manage all of that in a box that's pretty consistent and in line with what we have said in the past, except for a very significant downturn in business in Europe. So all that Luca said, but you got to actually start to look at the business -- and we try to give you all of this information to look at the business such that you can actually translate activity, which we split into 2 different -- we show in one segment that actually comes from 2 different segments into the rest of the results, revenue, et cetera.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess this one's probably for Luca. Can you give us a sense -- I mean, I guess are we -- on Services operating margins, are we now in the process of moving toward and reaching -- I guess, exiting this s*** [ph] going into next year, steady state in Services operating margins? Or could we see, I guess, some sort of similar dynamic in 2013, where we're still trying to stand up deals and we're not yet reaching steady-state operating margins?", "Luca Maestri", "I think we're going to exit 2012 at a level that where we feel it's pretty steady state. So you're going to see some progression during the course of 2012, and then steady state. But you also need to keep in mind -- and I know you know it very well, right? I mean, a lot of what we do is driven by the cadence of new contracts. And so, obviously, if we continue to see the level of revenue acceleration that we see in this year, then obviously, you're going to see some ups and downs in margins. But I would say end of 2012 is going to be pretty much our steady state.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And then, Luca, what would be the opportunity for Services operating margin expansion in 2013?", "Luca Maestri", "Well, of course, on a year-on-year basis, it's going to be obviously significant, right, because we're starting from a relatively low point in Q1.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Yes, I understood that. I guess what I'm wondering is, on a like-for-like basis, December quarter Services margins going forward through '13. What, inside the Services business, could improve the margins?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Well, I think that the -- as I said earlier, the maturing of the contracts. We track very closely each contract. And we know the margins, we know the start-up cost, we compare it against the models that we have built, and occasionally, we have things that we have to focus on more than we expected, and others go a little bit better than we expected. But we're confident that, as we move forward, that natural maturing will occur. The other thing that will happen in the fourth quarter is that we will, essentially, lap this big jump in growth. And that's one of the big reasons that we were confident you're going to see a margin increase. If we can tack another 5% growth on top so we're growing 15%, but you'd see same kind of activity. I guess that would be a really good problem to have.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Yes, got it. I guess I'm just trying to get your thoughts on the opportunity to expand margins, sort of, in 2013 with what's going on with the -- sort of as you see the book of business versus exiting the year.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. The other thing that's happening is that the use of the platforms that we've made significant investments in, the MMIS application that has taken us a long time to build is the first new MMIS system that's been built in 15 years, and it's compliant with all of the new regs and everything. That is a major accomplishment to get that in, and as we put applications or states on that new platform, we'll see improved margins.", "Ursula M. Burns", "The margin pressure for a new add is significantly less than it would have been -- than it was for California.", "Luca Maestri", "Ananda, to your question, maybe it's a bit early to start, for us, to start talking about 2013 operating margins at this point.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. And just one real quick one. Last one for me. Luca, what should we think about as the gross margin range for this year?", "Luca Maestri", "We're guiding 31% to 33%.", "Ursula M. Burns", "We'll see that improve sequentially.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "To Luca, the first one for you. Could you just confirm that the EPS guidance of $1.12 to $1.18, does that include the actuarial changes associated with the pension, whereby you have significant pension headwinds this year? I think it's $145 million.", "Luca Maestri", "All in. Although, Keith, the increase in pension contributions is in that range, in terms of the pension expense, which I think is going to be reflected in the EPS, is in the $40 million -- $40 million to $50 million range. But it's all in, all in.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "The second question I have then. Lynn, this is for you. You've talked a lot of confidence in the margins, and yet over the past -- particularly during calendar year '11 on Services, margins did disappoint, and it was fair consistent. And it was driven by, as Ursula said, I think the leakage on ITO. And so, if you could just come back and address, from a management, from a focus, from a systems perspective, what's different now, on the renewals in particular, that did not exist shortly after Xerox bought ACS and fairly consistently during CY '11?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "I think the renewal rate in -- particularly in ITO, was disappointing last year. And this not the -- it's not unprecedented that we've seen a point where we've had disappointing renewals in IT. It seems to have -- there are things that drive it, that sometimes we get a little bit behind. This year, because of the focus that we've put on IT renewals specifically, we have much more executive involvement earlier in the process. And as Ursula said, we don't have as many opportunities this year for renewal, which should help us in terms of the renewal rates as well. So more focus. I think just the attention, that's the main thing, and we've seen it before, and that's what we try to do.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Ursula, one last one for you. Drupa, how should we think about it? Do you think you'll get a little lift of off drupa, either in the June or September quarters? Or is the European backdrop such that we shouldn\u2019t be thinking about it? And that's it for me.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I don't think that we should be thinking about a specific drupa lift. I mean, if it happens, it -- I actually just don't think it's there. This show is a show of buying, but that buying is generally baked into the normal course of business. Drupa has been going on for years and years and years, and everybody expects what happens at drupa to happen. So drupa for us will be a color show. It will a show that we highlight the advances that we have in color and in solutions wrappers. So not a product show for us but more of a workflow show for us, like how do you put together packaging solutions, et cetera, et cetera. We'll have some new products there, but it won't be a product show, as I said. I don't think that you could bake a whole lot of hope on drupa changing the course of European Technology business.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Ursula, I was wondering if you can walk us through your latest read on the competitive landscape within document outsourcing. All of the key players continue to tout competitive momentum here. So it's a bit tough, for us on the outside, to see which vendors are really breaking out as long-term leaders. So if can give us your perspective on that, that'd be helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I think it has -- I would speak about 2 companies outside of the other group. So the other group is Canon, Ricoh, KM [Konica Minolta], the normal technology people, technology hardware providers, and they are still infants in document outsourcing. They're really not large players. They are trying to get together solutions and offer them, but we really don't compete actively against them. The places that we -- the competitors that we compete actively against are HP, Lexmark and us. Those are the 3 people who are in this document outsourcing business, today, as mature players. I'll break out HP, of those 3, as behind both Lexmark and Xerox. HP is trying hard to reorganize themselves into having a good set of solutions on the document outsourcing space, but they are lagging for sure. Xerox is ahead. We have not only our Document Outsourcing business, our Managed Print Services play, but the fact that we have a whole set of services that attach to that actually elevates us in the minds of particularly larger customers out there. We have an open platform, one that allows -- and a standard one, meaning open and people understand it. One that allows other people's technologies and other people's workflow and other people's processes to kind of come under the umbrella of us very easily. And we are innovative, so we continue to upgrade what we offer. So HP, behind. The next -- the last 2 are Lexmark and us, and Lexmark is a very specific segment kind of a player. They pick an industry and go after that industry. And the good news about that is that it leaves all the rest of the industries for us to focus on. And we actually continue to actually very, very aggressive against Lexmark in the document outsourcing market. So I think, all in all, if you look at the ratings of Gartner and IDC, if you look at how we're growing this business, 7% revenue growth in the quarter and how that revenue growth positions us from a size perspective, larger than anyone else, you'll see that in document outsourcing we are definitely winning. It's a very competitive market. So we can't take our eye off of it, but we are winning, and we have a gap between our next corporate competitor.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And just as an extension of that, if we just took a snapshot of the environment today. When you go up against HP and Lexmark, where does -- which verticals, types of contracts, does Xerox typically have an advantage? And where do you think you still have some work to do?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, we have strength in the tech sector, in the telecom sector and in banking. I think Lexmark kind of does legal fairly well, and they do some financial fairly well. So we have to -- they're going to try to catch us in the places that we're good, and we're going to definitely try to catch them in the places that they are good. So I think the market is still very wide open, which is the good thing, and the fact that our reputation is very strong here, it's not an easy thing for a customer to do, the fact our reputation is very strong here. And the fact that we're local, and a lot of the growth comes in the x -- what we call partner print services space. We call it XPPS. The fact that we're local and our global imaging partners go out with XPPS, it is really a win for us. They are very intimate with their clients. A lot of the growth is in the not-big segment, and so we're winning there. Our coverage is phenomenal there.", "So thank you very much, and if there are no more questions, thank you for joining us today, and have a very good summer.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3 with a review of the strategic imperatives that define our business and align with our financial performance.", "First, accelerating our Services business. We're operating in a market that is rich with opportunity, especially as more and more enterprises and governments seek efficient and productive ways to manage their operations. We're taking full advantage of our experience and expertise by diversifying our offerings, aggressively pursuing opportunities in key growth areas like e-discovery, HR outsourcing, customer care, transportation and health care and expanding globally. During the first year of this -- during the first half of this year, revenue from Services grew 8% in constant currency, tracking very well with our expectations.", "Second is maintaining our leadership in Technology. We're continuing to take a disciplined and practical approach to managing our Technology business for a sustained benefit to our bottom line. That means providing the industry's best technology, delivered through a cash-generating business model and focusing on building our business in color, SMB and across developing markets. During the first half of this year, installs of Xerox products were up 5% and in particular, our color MIF, that's machines in the field, was up 14%. Install and MIF growth is a good indication of future annuity revenue, reflecting our continued market share leadership and, in particular, the share that we're taking from competitors.", "Third, we're driving operational excellence across our enterprise. This means adjusting our cost model so that we're competitively advantaged and have the financial flexibility to adapt to changing marketplace needs while scaling in key growth areas. Operating expenses are down, which is indicative of our disciplined approach to managing our cost base. And in Services, we delivered sequential improvement in operating margins. By executing well on the first 3 priorities, we are very focused on the fourth, which is creating value for our shareholders, doing so by delivering solid earnings and allocating capital in the areas of acquisitions, dividends and share repurchase.", "The economic uncertainty has created more pressure especially in Europe, and especially impacting our Technology business. We benefit from offering a diverse portfolio that allows us to aggressively pursue areas of higher growth and to manage for improved profitability in more mature markets.", "The quarterly numbers give one picture, but I'm just as closely managing the progress that we're making to be increasingly differentiated and advantaged in the marketplace. We're winning customers' trust and helping them simplify how work gets done in ways that may surprise you.", "Please turn to Slide 4 for some examples of what I mean. Key to our Services growth is investing in those markets where we already have respected expertise and where we see potential for market expansion. The discovery process for the legal industry is a great example. It's a complex area and one that can be incredibly costly if left to more manual processes. We've built a competency in e-discovery through advanced software tools and services, and we just strengthened our advantage through the acquisition of Lateral Data. Its software helps firms and helps legal departments manage the entire discovery life cycle in simple and affordable ways.", "We're also taking this customized approach to the mobile phone market by acquiring U.K.-based WDS, which provides technical support to the world's largest wireless telecommunications brands. Through its proprietary cloud-based platform, WDS analyzes millions of technical support interactions across thousands of mobile devices. It then uses this data to help clients adjust any systematic problems, all real-time, fast and in productive ways.", "Productivity is also the benefit of advancing Technology and Services for health care. While the headlines this past month were all about what's next for the Affordable Care Act, we were already moving far ahead through our established relationship with health care payers, providers and government agencies. This includes Q2 announcements for developing Nevada's Health Information Exchange and enhancing New Mexico's Medicaid reimbursement services, to create a cloud-based portal that gives Florida business owners more health insurance choices, as well as being selected as the BPO provider for NIH. Xerox is exceptionally well positioned as a trusted provider for the business of health care.", "That's a quick glimpse of the stories behind the numbers. And we'll share more with you each quarter. And hopefully, they help to reframe your perception of Xerox to showcase the amazing opportunity that's in front of us and to better explain the evolving nature of our business mix and model.", "So now let's look at how this translates into our financial results. Turn to Slide 5. I'll provide a top-level review, then Luca will take you through the detail. And I'll close with our expectations for quarter 3, and then we'll take your questions.", "In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.26. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.22 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Earnings are in line with our expectations and reflect the investments that we're making to grow our business.", "Total revenue of $5.5 billion was down 1% and up 1% in constant currency. Demand for our industry-leading Managed Print Services led to a 6% increase in revenue from Document Outsourcing. ITO revenue was up 9%, a significant improvement from prior quarters. And revenue from Business Process Outsourcing grew 8%. Revenue from our Technology business declined 4%. This was impacted by the continued weak macroeconomic environment and by clients increasingly shifting to Xerox's Managed Print Services, which is reported in our Services segment. I remain quite pleased with our across-the-board progress in Services and the benefit that it brings to our top line.", "Strong revenue from Services, our growth driver today and in the future, gives us financial flexibility and helps minimize the impact from our slowing Technology business. We continue to make the appropriate investments in our Services business, which includes incurring startup costs to ramp new contracts.", "So as a result and as expected, we're facing near-term pressure on margins. But also as expected, we made sequential improvements in quarter 2. Operating margin of 9.7% was down 0 year-over-year and up 1.2 points from quarter 1. And that was driven by a 1.3 point sequential improvement from our Services business.", "Q2 gross margin of 32% was down 1.4 points, improving 1 point from quarter 1. This is in the range of our expectations for the first half of the year, and we balanced our investments by continuing to improve RD&E and SAG, which is now at 19.4% of revenue. We generated $228 million in cash from operations, again in line with expectations and reflecting the need to make higher cash pension contributions during the first half of the year. We remain confident in our ability to generate $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash. And we are continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchases.", "Please turn to Slide 6 for a closer look at our top line results. The metrics of these charts tell 2 different but key messages. First, reiterating the importance of Services in the total picture of our business. A year ago, the revenue coming from Services and Technology were about -- were evenly split. Now Services makes up 51% of the total, up from 48% a year ago. Second, a reminder of the significance of our annuity-driven business model. As you see here, 85% of our revenue is annuity, and it's up 2% in quarter 2. We remain focused on increasing profitable annuity-based revenue across our portfolio. We manage our services business for growth, building our pipeline, increasing signings of multiyear contracts and investing in acquisitions to strengthen our competencies.", "In addition to winning major BPO and ITO deals, we continue to lead with our Managed Print Services, which are in demand as enterprises look for ways to operate more efficient workplaces. For example, we recently signed a 6-year MPS contract with Boeing to consolidate its printers, copiers and fax machines and to implement a global printing framework based on price, energy, efficiency and ink use.", "We also strengthened our annuity stream through the installs of Xerox equipment. Our approach is to lead in color, so Xerox ink is being used to generate color pages printed in workplaces and print shops of any size. During the quarter, our color MIF was up 14%. Equipment sales revenue was down 6% in constant currency. And this is where we're seeing the largest impact from economic weakness, especially in Europe. In fact, 2/3 of the equipment sales revenue decline came from Europe. Equipment sales revenue was the most -- has the most volatility in our business right now, and it represents just 15% of our total revenue. We're managing it by being very disciplined with our cost base while expanding distribution to capture the opportunities in SMB and developing markets.", "In summary, we're clear-minded about the dynamics of our 2 businesses based on market opportunity and the macro environment. And we're managing our operations to align with the changing nature of both. In Services, again, our emphasis is on growth and making the investments to scale so that we can serve our clients in diverse, reliable and efficient ways anywhere around the world. And in Technology, we're sharply focused on streamlining the cost base. Our emphasis is on nurturing our resilient business model in ways that maintain market leadership while generating cash and supporting our bottom line.", "Considering the economic uncertainty, we now expect that revenue from technology will continue to be weak. As a result, we are revising our full year earnings expectations. They're based on continued strong year-over-year revenue growth from Services, lower revenue from Technology and the ongoing benefit from operational efficiencies.", "So let me turn it over to Luca. And I'll be back to wrap up and open the call to your questions. So Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, I believe we performed well in a weak economic environment to deliver 1% constant currency revenue growth and EPS within our guidance. Services, as expected, has strong growth, and we are confident this will continue for the balance of the year. Technology revenue improved sequentially, down 4% year-over-year versus down 5% in Q1 at constant currency. But this was helped by an easier compare. And we expect equipment revenue will continue to be pressured, given the challenging macro conditions.", "We were pleased with the margin performance despite being down from last year. Sequentially, gross margin improved 100 basis points to 32% and operating margin improved 120 basis points to 9.7%. Year-over-year, gross margin was down 140 basis points driven by Services and mix. Like Technology, gross margin was actually 20 basis points better. The drivers of the decline are generally consistent with what we saw in Q1. Services margin saw good sequential improvement, but as anticipated, we had margin compression due to new contract ramp-up costs. And this remains the largest driver of year-over-year margin decline. Also the increasing services mix continues to impact gross margin, but is fairly neutral to operating margin. The gross margin on our Services business is 1/2 that of our Technology segment, so the strong growth in Services has direct impact on overall gross margin.", "We again saw good progress in expense efficiencies with SG&A improvement of 50 basis points. As a result, operating margin was down 70 basis points year-over-year. We continue to expect operating margin to show year-over-year improvement by Q4. Restructuring of $29 million was $38 million higher year-over-year and it is important to note it is fully reflected in our adjusted results. Tax rate of 22.4% was lower than prior year. The EPS impact from higher restructuring and lower tax rate offset each other on a year-over-year basis. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 was down $0.01 from 2011, with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.", "Moving on to segment performance. Let me start with Services. Services revenue was up 7% in Q2. The growth rate was somewhat lower than Q1, driven by BPO. This reflected some timing of revenues and some lower volumes in areas such as transportation and customer care. ITO showed good revenue acceleration and was up 9%. New contracts signed in recent quarters are now beginning to ramp. And we have about 3 points of growth related to intercompany services as this business is taking over more of our own IT infrastructure. We, of course, eliminate this intercompany growth within total Services.", "Also Document Outsourcing continues to show a good pace of growth, up 6% at constant currency. Given the neutral economic environment, we believe this overall performance confirms the strength of our diversified Services portfolio. We expect growth in Q3 will be in line or better than Q2. It is worth noting that the Q2 growth was almost entirely organic. But clearly, we will continue to support Services growth with tuck-in acquisitions, the latest examples being the WDS and Lateral Data acquisitions that Ursula just highlighted.", "Signings in Q2 were lower year-over-year and down 1% on a trailing 12-month basis. The year-over-year decline is caused by less renewal potential this year despite a strong 89% renewal rate for the combined BPO and ITO business. New business signings on a trailing 12-month basis are up 13% and continue to drive our revenue performance.", "Services margin of 10.6%, while down year-over-year, showed a 130 basis point sequential improvement. We continue to expect that by Q4, Services margin will show year-over-year improvement and will be within our 11% to 13% target range for Services.", "Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 4% and document-related revenues, which includes Document Outsourcing, were down 2% at constant currency. Despite the sequential improvement in Technology revenue, it is fair to say we saw increased pressure on our results from the macro environment. Equipment, in particular, was lower than anticipated, driven by weakness in Europe and the continued success of our partner print services offering, which results in some revenue shifting from Technology to Services.", "The sequential improvement in revenue was driven by unbundled supplies, which was up 5% versus down 7% in Q1. Unbundled supplies represent a little less than 20% of our Technology revenues and is predominantly aligned with entry products. It can be volatile, given channel inventory dynamics, which is what we saw in Q1 and in Q2.", "Looking at product [ph] segments. Part of the weakness in equipment revenue was mix. We saw a rebound in entry, thanks to the new products and OEM sales. High-end showed very strong color install growth, but this was driven primarily by the entry production products. And mid-range was impacted by the migration into Managed Print Services. We are planning for equipment revenue to continue to be weak in Q3, and therefore for total revenue declines to be down mid-single-digits for Technology.", "Segment margin of 11.3% was down slightly from 2011 but reflected continued cost and expense control and was above our 9% to 11% target range for Technology. There are obviously a number of different dynamics at play in the market. And as we move to the key metrics slide, I would like to give some additional insight into how we view and how we're managing our different businesses.", "Let's look first at Services. The company has gone through a transformation over the past 2 years, with Services now accounting for over 51% of total revenues. And we clearly expect this trend to continue. A few important points to make regarding our position in Services and future expectations. We are a leader in a number of very attractive and growing Services segments, including health care, both government and commercial; commercial BPO areas, such as human resource, outsourcing and transaction processing; as well as transportation.", "We have strength in 3 very important capability areas: ITO, customer care and document management, which we leverage across all of our lines of business. And we have a tremendous opportunity to increase our capabilities, leverage innovation to build greater differentiation and expand globally. This should lead to greater operating leverage and value add, which will improve not only revenue but margins over time. Services will be the growth driver for the company and also will make us a more valued partner to our entire customer base.", "In terms of Technology, I want to address how we're managing the continued impact of a weak macro environment. First, we have been gaining market share for several quarters, and we do not have significant exposure in some of the areas of greatest secular pressure such as consumer and single-function devices. For instance, when you look at the metrics on this slide, they're generally stable and in some cases positive. Second, we continue to selectively invest in areas where we see the greatest growth opportunities such as small- and medium-sized business, Managed Print Services and color. And third, we have realized sooner than many, that there are specific areas of secular pressure such as transaction state [ph] in printing that impact us. As a result, since the end of 2008, we have proactively worked to make our business more annuity-based, our cost base more flexible and our investments more focused.", "Our document-related business remains attractive. It has a very large annuity stream and good cash dynamics, limited capital requirements and committed revenue streams. We are the global market leader, have great technology and strong customer relationships, and we can leverage these characteristics to strengthen our Services business further.", "If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review Q2 cash flow. Cash from Operations was a source of $228 million, which compares to a source of $347 million in 2011. Through the first half, cash flow was $213 million versus $317 million in 2011. This is fully in line with our expectations as the driver of the year-over-year decrease is the timing of pension contributions. Cash contributions through our global pension plans in Q2 were $158 million, which was $80 million higher than 2011. We now expect second half contributions of approximately $150 million versus $303 million last year.", "We spent $115 million on CapEx, which is consistent with our annual forecast of around $500 million, and we decreased debt by $455 million. Dividends paid was $63 million, and we repurchased $306 million of stock. This was an acceleration compared to our original plan, and we continue to plan to repurchase between $900 million and $1.1 billion for the year, weighted towards the end of the year. Finally, we remain on track for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating cash flow for the year.", "Let us turn to the next slide to review our capital structure. Our Q2 ending debt balance decreased to $9.2 billion. In May, we retired $1.1 billion in senior notes, which was the only term debt coming due this year. From a maturity standpoint, we maintain a well-balanced debt ladder, with just about $1 billion coming due annually. During the course of the year, our debt balance may change moderately, given timing of cash flows, but we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The vast majority of our debt is in support of our financing of customer leases. Of the $9.2 billion debt balance, $5.6 billion can be associated with the financing of Xerox equipment for our customers. The finance that is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.4 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.", "In Q2, as I said, we made good progress on share repurchase, $306 million or 41 million shares. We have said all along that our repurchases will be back half-weighted, given timing of cash flows, but we are maximizing what we can do in the near term, given the share price opportunity.", "In summary, we continue to be focused on growing and improving the profitability of our Services business while maintaining our profitable leadership in Technology. We are seeing the impact of macro weakness, but believe we are well positioned to have steady revenues and profits through this time. In terms of capital allocation, we remain committed to using our strong cash flow to return value to shareholders through share repurchase, dividends and accretive tuck-in acquisitions.", "With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Our results in the second quarter reflect consistent progress. Growth in Services, increase in annuity revenue, a steady pace of increasing installs and color MIF, sequential margin improvement in Services, disciplined cost management and on-track performance with cash generation and capital allocation all delivered to build value for our stakeholders and more value in our business.", "Our guidance on cash remains unchanged, and we remain committed to investing in share repurchase throughout the year. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.24 to $0.26 per share, and we now expect full year adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.12, which comprehends the continued revenue weakness that we're expecting from our Technology business.", "With that, I thank you again for joining us today. And as we get to your questions, I know that you want to dive deeper into trends, especially in our Services business. So we have in the room with us today Lynn Blodgett, who's the President of our Xerox Services business. Now let's open it up to your questions, and I'll field them and ask either Lynn or Luca to chime in as well.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "I guess, the first question, Ursula, is can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of the pressure on the Technology side, whether you'd see if this is a cyclical issue, clearly, Europe is weak from an economic standpoint, or more of a secular trend? I think you've talked about it some in the past. So I'm curious if you've seen any changes in maybe the rate of decline on the secular side. Just any clarity you can give us there would be helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns", "It's a good question, I think, one that many people have, so we're going to spend a little bit of time talking our way through this. First, let me start with secular -- the secular trends that we're seeing in the marketplace. We see a growth in color almost across-the-board, so mid-range, high-end places that we participate. We see that in color MIF increasing and color pages increasing. We see a shift, a decided shift, towards Managed Print Services away from single-function devices. We don't have a very large business in single-function devices, black and white, or color at the low end. And we took advantage of this lack of participation by driving -- by starting and then driving a Managed Print Services business. More and more customers are pushing towards Managed Print Services. There is no doubt about it. All of our competitors are now engaged in Managed Print Services. We have been engaged for a long time, and we're leading. That's the second secular trend. We see growth in small- and mid-sized businesses everywhere around the world, U.S. and in developing economies particularly. We see a move away from, which we've seen for quite a few years now, high-end black-and-white transactional pages. That move is continuing and has not slowed down. It's -- the momentum is there and we have recognized that and baked that into our business model and our guidance on a go-forward basis. We have not seen a slowdown or a shift in those secular trends at all. If you look at the macro environment, and then I'll bring it altogether, we have seen a considered slowing of business in Europe. We saw this a little bit later than most. But in the first -- and in the first quarter, we definitely started to see the pickup. We have seen acceleration of that softness in the second quarter, towards the end of the second quarter. That's the reason why we've adjusted our guidance downwards. We're now assuming and planning for mid-single-digit declines in equipment revenue in the Technology segment. This is revenue in Technology segment. This is a big change from where we were in the first quarter. We were thinking that we could hold that to flat to low single-digits. Now I think that's not a realistic expectation. So secular trends haven't changed. I mean, we haven't seen a change. If you look at North America and DMO, we still see pickup in color, move to MPS, a slowdown in high-end black-and-white printing, a pickup of SMB businesses. So that's still there. And on a macro side, we are definitely seeing a weak Europe. I hope that answered it.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Yes. No, that was helpful. My next question is for Lynn actually or Ursula, or whoever wants to take it. Can you talk a bit about what's going on in the health care side in your Services business. Opportunities, challenges, given Obamacare and all that sort of developing right now?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I'll have Lynn take it. We are pleased, really pleased and very excited about health care. But I'll have Lynn dive into it. It's a real winner for us. Lynn?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Shannon, as you know, we are very well positioned in all of the aspects of health care. Our health care business has grown and is now a significant part of the overall portfolio. And we have Services in the private sector, both in the payer and the provider side and on the government side. And so this -- the whole effort around Affordable Care is something that we feel we're very well positioned for, as well as just the continued evolution on the private side. So we feel very, very good about our position in health care.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "But can you give us some idea of how big it is?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "It's right now about $2 billion of the portfolio, so about 10% of the overall portfolio, and it's growing nicely.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And that $2 billion is just for the health care provision in BPO and ITO. We have obviously in our Technology side, we have support of the health care as well. But for the Services business, BPO and ITO, we are definitely a leader here. We also have just recently won some new business throughout the States, and you'll be seeing that in the next quarter.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Great. And then my follow-up question for Luca, we've been hearing more about sort of questions about the leasing business, your thoughts on how big of a leasing business you need to maintain, given your mix to a -- or your migration to Services. So can you talk a little bit about how you think about the leasing business strategically?", "Luca Maestri", "Well, the leasing business is directly related to our equipment revenue. We support our customers by financing those leases. 85% of all the equipment that we sell is financed by ourselves to our customers. You would see that the size of the portfolio has come down a bit, in line with the decline in equipment revenue. It is really a part and parcel of our go-to-market strategy. It is a great differentiator for us in the marketplace, particularly at times when credit becomes difficult. So it's a business that we like because it's very profitable and it's very much bundled together with the rest of the Technology business. It will follow -- in terms of the sizing, it will follow very much the progression in our Technology revenue and particularly equipment revenue.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Is this something that you need to keep in the same size you have? Or is it something where you can look for partners,though [ph] over time?", "Luca Maestri", "Well, again, it's a profitable business. Of course, if we can find more efficient ways to run it, we will do so. At this point, again, it's a very profitable business, and that's the way we're keeping it right now.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to ask you if we should be concerned about Services bookings down 26% in the quarter after being down 27% year-over-year the prior quarter on some pretty easy compares and the dropoff in the renewal rate.", "Luca Maestri", "So Ben, let me start with the renewal rate. Renewal rate was excellent during the second quarter, we're at 89% with the top of our range of 85% to 90%. The drop in bookings, very much driven by less renewal potential. Less renewal potential is not necessarily bad. It means that we got long-term contracts. And in this given quarter, we didn't have much link [ph] to renew. And as you know, renewing contracts tends to bring some compression in margins. If you look at our new business signings and you look at it on a trailing 12-month basis, actually we're up 13%, very good. And by the way, we have seen some level of delays in decision-making during the quarter, particularly in Document Outsourcing. Our pipeline is now -- has now grown 10% in the quarter. So new business signings up 13%, pipeline up 10%. So we are not concerned about the progression of signings.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "One of the other things, Ben, this issue of renewal, it's a kind of an interesting metric because it actually is better for us. If you consider the risk that's associated with renewals, and as Luca said, with margin compression, the fact that we don't have much up for renewal is a good thing and we renewed a high percentage of that. So we feel very good about renewals and we're glad there wasn't a lot up for grabs.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Yes. With regard to the Technology segment, if you could just kind of talk a little bit more about your positioning. What we're seeing is a rapid dropoff in a lot of the entry level in the inkjet -- some of the inkjet areas for certain players. And I was just wondering if you could talk about your relative positioning among the segments. You tend to call an entry level at a higher level than some of the others. And if you could just talk about your relative positioning there and by the segment and what kind of deceleration you're expecting.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Right. So there's 2 ways to look at this. First is on the traditional single-function low end, either consumer or very small business, very, very small business market. We are a de minimis player in that portion of the market. We serve those customers through resellers. Any resellers who are interested in taking our products and moving it, we're a very, very small player there. The next segment is a little bit higher up in the SMB place and primarily color and multifunction devices, A4 configuration but some small A3 as well. If you look at our install growth across entry, we've grown installs in all of those places and even in the very, very small color printers, A4 color and A4 Mono. But we are relatively small in this segment and serve it through resellers. The way we participate here is through MPS. And MPS does 2 things for us. One, we can deliver some of our technology into a client's account, SMB and large customers as well. But we also, through our success in MPS, take over pages in clients' accounts that are not done on our technology today. So what we are seeing is definitely a softening of the market potential for the small devices, particularly single-function devices. And we participate in that, not by bringing new technology only but by bringing new offer called MPS. I hope that answered it.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Yes. And could you just clarify how -- what kind of growth rate now you expect at the high end, considering I think it has a disproportionate share of the EBIT in the segment?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. We still -- we expect to continue to grow color, high-end color, mid- to high and high-end color installs and activity and revenue, particularly in color. And we expect to continue to see weakness or declines, revenue declines in our high-end black-and-white business. There's no doubt about either those things. Luca -- you want to say something Luca? Because I think that, that's -- yes, so the trends haven't changed. I mean, we're shifting towards color. We're still moving some pages down from offset to color, driven by applications. That's why we're seeing even in weak economic environment some buoyancy in color, the color metrics, and we are definitely continuing to see the move from black-and-white in the high-end.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I'd like to extend Ben's question for a second if I could. On bookings, A, what are you anticipating for the next couple of quarters? The compares certainly don't get any easier. And then part -- well, I'll save part B of that question. But if you could just go over A for a second.", "Luca Maestri", "We anticipate a sequential progression in signings. We know we signed a lot during the course of the second half of last year. But clearly, we expect the signings acceleration as we get into Q3.", "Ursula M. Burns", "The pipeline is growing. The pipeline is strong and is growing. It's growing 10% and is growing across the 3 lines of business and in subsegments of the business, so we're not seeing a concentration of pipeline at all and we're seeing expansion in just about all over the line. So we do expect this, as Luca said, for signings to continue to be strong.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. But if I extend that for a second, let's presume for the year because right now, you are down 26% year-over-year first half. So let's say you're down 20% to 25% for the year on your bookings. With that as an assumption, will you still be able to grow Services, say, in the mid-single-digits to high single-digits as you look out over calendar year '13?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. I think that the signings rate that you're looking at is a little bit misleading because of the renewals. And again, if we don't have the challenge of renewing something, that's better than it coming up for renewal because we don't have a reprice and that is skewing the number. As Luca said, we definitely have a difficult compare in the second half. But we expect bookings, new business bookings, which are the things that -- new business bookings and renewal rate are the 2 things -- not renewal volume but renewal rate, are the things that drive growth. And because those are improving, we feel comfortable in maintaining the growth rates.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Let me ask another on Services. Ursula, for you, the tuck-in acquisitions is identified as being $300 million to $400 million for the full year. Is that a run rate we should be thinking about even as we look at CY '13?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We haven't given a lot of guidance on CY '13. But I would say that acquisitions across-the-board in both Services -- across-the-board in Services and in Distribution, a little bit less there, are part of the business model for our business. And so tuck-in acquisitions is something that you should continue to see, particularly in Services, for the foreseeable future.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. I'm going to ask one more, then I'll cede the floor. For Lynn, if I could, Lynn, could you just describe how your direct level reports have changed in the last year as the business has changed? And what I'm interested in is the influx of, say, Xerox people or even adding to third parties from Accentures to the IBMs of the world that would help in the consulting side of the business or ITO areas.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Well, I think that we have a very good mix, particularly in my direct report of people who have experience from the private sector and the public sector. We have continued to, over the last year, to align the chief -- the operating officers on a more vertical basis, so we have a commercial health care person, a government health care person and so on. So we think that improves the focus and the subject matter expertise. And we've had nice movement of people from the traditional ACS side of the business over into the Xerox ranks and vice versa. So my chief financial officer, for example, is directly from Xerox and has been a tremendous addition to us. And we continue to look outside. We try to promote from within as much as we can. But we also know that it's -- that you have to have a healthy mix of new talent. A lot of our new talent comes via acquisition. And that's probably the biggest force of influx of new talent. But we, because of each competitor that we have, go through cycles. And when one is having difficulties, we try to take advantage of that and hire talent from those people.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Murray.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess, the first one is for Luca. Luca, can you walk through how much wiggle room, I guess, through the cash flow dynamics for a CFO? And I know you sound like you said you came in line with what you were expecting this quarter. I think it was a little bit lighter than what most folks were expecting. So can you talk through sort of the wiggle room in the reiteration of the guidance for the second half of the year? Sort of, I guess, how comfortable are you now with that guidance, because you didn't lower it, but you're lowering overall P&L guidance, and maybe what some of the influences are in there? And are there any tailwinds that we should be thinking of?", "Luca Maestri", "Sure. And let me start with that, with the issue of guidance. So we're still comfortable with the $2 billion to $2.3 billion even though we've taken earnings down. When you look at our reduction of guidance in EPS, when you do the math, it translates to approximately $100 million of pretax cash earnings. So that obviously, that's a headwind. What offsets that is the fact that a portion of the reduction comes from equipment. And so also our leasing business will reduce, our leasing receivables will come down, and that will give us a partial offset in cash. And then the other tailwind that we have is that we now expect our pension contributions to be about $50 million lower than we were forecasting previously because of this recent pension funding legislation that was passed at the end of June. So that's why we end up with a similar cash flow as prior quarter. When we look at it in progression, first half versus second half, again, we have delivered exactly the same level of cash flow in 2012 first half versus the first 6 months of 2011, when you exclude the different timing of the pension contributions. So as we look ahead and we know how much cash we have delivered last year, again, we think we can be well within the range.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "Awesome. And I guess, for probably for sort of for Luca and for Lynn, on the Services operating margin expectations for the second half of the year, how does the macro softness -- or does macro softness influence what you guys are expecting from the Services side through the year? Then I have a follow-up to that as well.", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. In general, Services is much more resilient to the macro, but there are areas of our Services business that -- and we've seen it already in Q2 where, for example, transportation or customer care, that you end up getting lower volumes with lower levels of activity. But as we look at our progression, we said it before, we expect that by Q4, we will be within our target range, 11% to 13% for our Services operating margins. And we were pleased with the progress that we made in Q2. We expect Q3 to be more or less in that ballpark that we've seen for Q2.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And Luca -- it's just a follow-up on that. I mean, are the operating margins in Services, have they been tracking relative to your expectations? And do you have any -- is there anything that can possibly offset some of the lower volumes like lower unemployment claims or something like that?", "Luca Maestri", "Of course, we have such a diversified portfolio that you always get some offset. But again in Q2, we -- our operating margin in Services was slightly ahead of our expectations.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I have a question on the supplies revenue growth. You had mentioned that it was partially driven by timing of purchases for channel partners. Could you dig into that a bit more and help us understand how much of an impact that had on growth? And then off of that, how should we think about the growth pattern as a result of that in the third and fourth quarters? And then I guess, finally on that, how should we think about macro risks to supplies consumption in coming quarters, given that I think some of your competitors are starting to see some consumption pressure as a result of the macro environment?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So let me start with Q1 and Q2. There were inventory dynamics in Q1. They were kind of negative, so we were down 7%. In Q2, the positive 5%, Bill, is a combination of an easier compare because of the Japan situation last year. And I would say it was about 50-50, some of it was the reversal of some of this inventory dynamics, some of it was the easier compare. As we look at the second half of the year, we expect some slight decline. So when you look at the full year for supplies, down slightly for the full year, which is exactly what we said last time around. And of course, some of it is around macro weakness.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And you asked about the supply consumption and what -- how they tie to macro. Remember that these supplies that we're reporting here is not all of the supplies that we actually sell in our business. Most of the supplies are bundled in our contracts. This is about 20% of the supplies, and as Luca said, is volatile given our channel partners buying at certain times versus pricing, et cetera, and their cash flow needs. But on the major portion of our business, the supplies are trending towards the macro environment, which is a move towards color, a move towards MPS. So all of the things -- and a move away from black-and-white at the high-end. That is in the business model and incorporated in how our supplies are being consumed.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And then one more question. There's been quite a bit of variability on share count estimates for you guys, particularly as folks try to fine-tune the timing of the buybacks. Just so we're all level set, can you help us understand how you're thinking about the diluted share count dynamic in the third and fourth quarter and as we exit the year?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So Bill, we provided on Page 20 of our deck, we provided you with the fully diluted shares as of June 30, right? That we are at 1,366 million. And then you need to think about it in terms of the different dynamics. We're going to be buying back shares throughout that quarter, I would say relatively consistently. And we will be issuing some minor amounts for stock compensation plans. And then you need to do the average of the 3 months. And then you'll come out with an -- weighted average shares for adjusted EPS for Q3. And then you take whatever is the ending point and that would be your starting point for Q4. I hope it's clear enough. But clearly, we can give you much more detail, if you want, separately.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, I guess, just to clarify the variability, particularly is on the fourth quarter. Some folks have a pretty significant decline in the share count because of buyback assumptions. So specifically if you could help us understand how we should think about that sequential move with the back-end-loaded nature of your buyback.", "Luca Maestri", "No. Right. You're not going to see it. You're not going to see the full impact, right, because it's going to be a weighted average of the 3 months of Q4. So for the purposes of EPS, it's obviously a limited impact. You will have the full effect only starting in January of 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First question is more high-level. Just curious here, Ursula or Lynn, if you're starting to see some folks pull forward purchases because they're worried about decreased purchasing power owing to currency fluctuations down the road. So are you worried that maybe the forward quarters are maybe being mortgaged here in the very near term because of some currency issues?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Not at all. We are not seeing -- that dynamic is an interesting one that you just said. We're not seeing that. We see a healthy mix of people telling us that they're going to wait, people buying now and people -- we don't see a lot of people saying, \"Please, I want to buy earlier.\" We're seeing a normal business mix here, particularly on the Services side. On the Technology side, what we are seeing is people saying, \"For any large equipment purchase, let me think about it a little bit more.\" And for -- and therefore, sweating their assets a little bit more. And therefore, what we see, equipment sales revenue softness with that. That's primarily happening in Europe, but we're also seeing in the United States a mix down. So people are buying, particularly in color, for example, they're -- our color install growth and activity growth was at the lower end of the high segment of that market. And so you see a huge activity growth, but it doesn't always translate to revenue because the number of devices -- the sizes of the devices are smaller. But we're not seeing people move forward stuff and therefore putting pressure on our go-forward.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then the other question here, either for Luca or Lynn, just kind of curious here in terms of the Services business. You're definitely signaling, it appears, that the gross margin improvement in Services are sustainable. And I'm trying to figure out how that impacts the cash flow. Are we getting to the point now where you're going to finally see later this year and early 2013 that positive inflection point, where the start-up costs of a lot of these Services engagements starts to fade, and thereby you start having better gross margin but also better cash flow? And is that supporting the cash flow reiteration for 2012?", "Luca Maestri", "So first of all, on gross margins. And I think you're asking about operating margins on the Services side as well, right? Let me repeat, we expect to see -- to come out of 2012 at an operating margin level for Services which is better than 2011. And obviously, we believe that, that will carry forward in 2013 and give us some tailwind. Regarding capital use and the ramp-up of these contracts, clearly, the investments that we've made for the contracts that we're ramping up are declining because we've now ramped up these contracts. But we want to continue to grow this business. And depending on the profile of the contracts that we're going to be signing, there's going to be capital requirements. And certainly, we're not going to shy away from growing the Services business because it requires some capital investment upfront. From an operating cash flow perspective, I'll just repeat what I just said before. We are comfortable with our guidance. And it includes the type of investments that we need to make for the Services business. This year, in general, the Services business has fewer megadeals than we've seen in 2010 and 2011. These megadeals typically requires additional capital. So when you do a compare year-over-year, there's less use of capital on the Services side for new contracts.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about the competitive environment on both the Technology business and the Services business. Ursula, on Technology, in your prepared remarks, you indicated you're gaining some market share, so I was hoping to flush that out a little bit. Where are you seeing market share gains, against which competitors and in which segments? And then secondly, as it relates to Services and the deferral of activity that you referenced, are you likewise seeing an increasing competitive environment or pricing environment on those new contracts?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Okay. I will take the share, and then I'll have Lynn chime in on the pricing environment of Services. So on competitive environment in Technology, we are absolutely gaining share, publicly reported, externally reported positioning, we gained share in all -- we've gained share in all segments of the business in North America and in developing markets. And it's kind of hard to tell what's exactly happening in Europe. It seems like we're gaining share there as well, but we also have some share weakness in certain segments. So potentially, yes, we're gaining share.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "If I can just interject on -- just trying to help you, Ursula, that's all. In terms of the deferral of opportunities that was just alluded to, that, first of all, is not substantial and it's not driven by a change in competition. It has much more to do with people just being a little more cautious in their decisioning process. We're always asked about the change in competition or are we seeing a significant shift from one competitor to another. Because we're in so many different markets, we deal with competitors, a very wide set of competitors. And in general, we haven't seen any sort of a material shift in the competitive landscape.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Let me go back to Technology, I'm not choking anymore. So as I said, we are gaining share particularly in the United States and in key markets in developing markets. We are gaining in most segments. And the competitors that we're taking from are other traditional competitors. I mean, there is Ricoh, who has some challenges that they're working their way through in 2012. There's HP, there's -- I mean, normal places, different competitors, different segments. The most competitive segment right now is the high end of the color printing business. It's probably the most competitive segment, and we're holding our own there, and in certain places, winning share.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "My follow-up is around R&D and your commitment to R&D. On a year-on-year basis, R&D is down 8%, on a 2-year basis, it's down 17%. Is this level of R&D sustainable over time? And can you continue to cut R&D and remain competitive in both Tech and Tech Services?", "Luca Maestri", "Important to keep in mind that when you look at our R&D number, they're only a fraction of what we spend, right? Our R&D activities are coordinated with Fuji Xerox in Japan. And when you combine the R&D spend of the 2 companies, you actually conclude that our R&D investment in Technology is very healthy. There are some areas of R&D, particularly the noncore areas, where obviously, we're looking for cost efficiencies and we look for outsourcing opportunity in that space. But those are again, I repeat, the noncore portions of R&D. We feel very well -- very good about our product development capabilities, as is reflected in the fact that we've been gaining market share for several quarters.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And innovation in Services shows up in a shift that we're making in our core R&D that you see reported. But also other innovation in Services happens in a way that doesn't come out, it's almost in the operating expense line of the business. So we're very focused on R&D, on innovation, very focused on innovation. We are coordinating with Fuji Xerox and we are absolutely not stepping away from being a market leader in all of the areas that we said were focus for us. That's Services, all lines, small- and medium-sized business, so we have a lot of efforts there, color for sure and MPS, spending a lot of money in those areas. And we'll continue on a go-forward basis.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Alban Gashi with Credit Suisse.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess, my question is as the Technology business comes down throughout the year, given the equipment downturn, how does that impact the Technology margins as you get higher supply side? And then just a quick follow-up for Lynn on Services.", "Luca Maestri", "No. Obviously, without a doubt -- and that is the reason why we've reduced guidance on EPS. Without a doubt, a slowdown in equipment and a slowdown in Technology revenue, in general, has an impact on margins, so we're going to see some lower margins on the Technology side. The way we deal with it is the way we've been dealing with it for many years, which is really relentless focus on cost management and trying to grow those areas of the business that provide some growth opportunity. But that's fundamentally, Alban, the reason why we've taken EPS down.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess, Lynn, on the Services margin. As you get back into your target range of 11% to 13%, can you put into context some of the drivers of between the mega contracts maturing, overall operational improvements, and then just revenue growth and mix, sort of ranking them?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Well, I think that the biggest contributor would be the ramping of the megadeals. But as Luca said, we haven't had as many megadeals this year as last year so that in and of itself should provide us some relief. But we also want to continue. We never want to shy away from an opportunity that has a reasonable return associated with it because of the start-up expense. And so we're -- we think it will come from the lower megadeals, where as we implement, we improve operational efficiency. So you have that investment that happens when you're starting up, and then you have a natural improvement in productivity just as the contract matures so that will also contribute. But we hope that our bookings will continue strong, and so that will counterbalance that to a certain extent.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And I guess, just as a quick follow-up to that. As you end the year in the fourth quarter, you said you expected to be higher year-over-year than the fourth quarter of last year. But I guess, where are you expected to be within the 11% to 13% range?", "Luca Maestri", "Within that range.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Lower, higher end?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. Solidly within the range.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Solidly within the range. And we'll give you more -- we have an investor conference in November, and we'll be able to give you more detail about the Services business and the progression that we're making there, which is very strong, very good on just about every operational line. And the Technology business, where we still have a very strong position, we'll be able to lay out in more detail what we expect for 2013 and beyond at the investor conference.", "So thanks for your time and for your interest and please enjoy the weekend.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. We'll get started on Slide 3 with a review of what we're seeing in the marketplace and how it's affecting our business.", "We began the year knowing we'd face certain challenges, especially as the European economies came under significant pressure as we made strategic investments to ramp our services growth. However, we did not predict the incremental strains on the business from more worldwide -- widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the United States.", "During the third quarter, we experienced a much more constrained spending environment in the States. European economies remained weak, and developing markets were stable. Overall, our third quarter performance reflects shifts in our business as services become a larger portion of our revenue, as well as the dynamics of a challenging economy that's creating cost pressures for large enterprises and governments.", "For example, due to budget constraints, less funding is available for major government projects. In the rare case, as we experienced this quarter, implementation on a committed project was halted even after we made upfront investments to get it off the ground. The resulting impact can be seen in our Q3 services margin, which came in lower than we expected.", "The conservatism we're seeing in government has transferred to large enterprises as well. It leads to longer sales cycles, shorter contract durations and smaller related contract value. This is certainly a prudent way to manage operations in times of economic volatility. It's definitely how we're managing our business and how our clients are managing theirs.", "It's also one of the reasons that we're seeing clients adopt Managed Print Services, which deliver cost savings quickly with minimal upfront capital investment. That said, when I review our third quarter results through the lens of what's happening in the marketplace, I remain confident that our strategy is sound, that our healthy annuity and our diverse portfolio help us mitigate challenges, and that our focus on cost and operational efficiencies give us the flexibility to invest wisely in growth and in building shareholder value.", "So let's move to Slide 4. I'll provide an overview of the quarter. Luca will cover some additional details, and then we'll take your questions.", "In the third quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.25. On a GAAP basis, earnings were $0.21 per share. This includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles.", "Total revenue of $5.4 billion was down 3% and down 1% in constant currency. It is important to note that the fundamentals of our strategy are delivering as expected. We're managing our Services business for growth and our Technology business to maximize profit. Our Q3 results reflect consistent progress in both areas, top line revenue growth from services and operating margin improvement from technology.", "Services revenue was up 6% in constant currency. This includes a 9% growth in our BPO business, a 4% growth in Document Outsourcing and 6% growth in IT Outsourcing, solid across-the-board progress.", "Services now represent 52% of our total revenue. Revenue from Document Technology was down 7% in constant currency. Equipment sales were more significantly impacted by economic and industry trends than prior quarters, especially in the United States and with large enterprises. We expect continued pressure in this area, and we remain clear-minded on the best way to invest in and manage the business.", "For example, we're expanding indirect channels to capture more of the SMB opportunity, and in our mature, print-related businesses, we're maximizing profitability through a more efficient infrastructure.", "Margins from our Technology business held up well in the quarter. Margins in Services did not. In addition to making planned upfront investments in several new services deals, which we knew will result in year-over-year margin decline, we saw the profitability of a few large government contracts become hampered by constraints in government spending, resulting in a greater quarter 3 margin decline than we expected.  So the major issues are understood but then, that doesn't make them acceptable. We're reacting quickly and working hard to mitigate the impact and get our margins back where they need to be. To do this, we are planning for additional restructuring during the balance of this year, which will be primarily focused on delivering operational improvements in our Services business. Luca will share more details on the related Q4 charge.", "We generated $594 million in cash from operations, keeping us on track to deliver $2 billion to $2.3 billion in full year operating cash, and we're counting -- we're continuing to use available cash for acquisitions and share repurchases. The quarterly numbers give one picture, but understanding the breadth of our new company is fundamental to the value and the sizable opportunities in front of us. The Xerox brand is behind the scenes in many areas that may surprise you, areas where we're asserting leadership, we're earning customers' trust, and we're winning significant new business. Turn to Slide 5 for some of the examples.", "It's important to note that many of our government contracts support nondiscretionary programs like Medicaid, which despite budgetary pressures, always needs to be fully funded. In fact, much of health care is nondiscretionary for providers and payers alike. Xerox had a deep expertise in the business of health care simplifying the administrative complexities and preparing government, employers, providers and payers for changing regulations. As a result, major insurers depend on Xerox to handle their call centers for Medicare claims reimbursement. And more and more health care providers are calling on us to help implement electronic health record systems, a rapidly growing business in which we are a key player.", "Emerging markets provide another area of growth for us and reflect one of the benefits of Xerox acquiring ACS. Our brand strength is key to expanding outsourcing services beyond the U.S. We're able to tap into long-established relationships with enterprises around the globe to shift from being a Document Technology provider to a broader solutions partner.", "For example, we're handling the transaction processing for clients in a major Latin American bank opening -- bank open new retail accounts. And in Russia, we're applying our IT and advanced imaging expertise to develop a new invoicing system for a large retailer.", "Enterprise -- expertise and innovation play across several industries and are the differentiated advantage that we bring to clients who want more than a basic service. That's why McDonald's selected us to provide their restaurants' IT support in several regions and why we won $153 million deal to manage the data centers for a global energy company. We don't want for opportunities, and we're making meaningful progress in capturing them around the world and throughout our business.", "Please turn to Slide 6. There are 2 important points that these numbers reflect. First, reiterating the increasing strength of our Services business as it becomes a larger portion of our total revenue and why we are so focused on acquisitions, innovation and global expansion to give us even more scale and diversified offering.  A year ago, Services represented 49% of our total revenue, and now it's 52%.", "Second, a reminder of the significance of our annuity-driven business model. As you see here, 85% of our revenue was annuity. That's $4.6 billion in recurring revenue, up 2% this year. While equipment sales, the much smaller percentage of our business, is most impacted by economic and industry trends, we continue to benefit from the stability of an annuity-based business model that helps us deliver solid cash flow and earnings.", "So in summary, this quarter presented its fair share of challenges, and we believe economic headwinds are still ahead of us. At the same time, we too are closely managing our operations to drive more efficiency and to give us more financial flexibility as our business dynamics shift.", "In Services, again our emphasis were in growth and margin improvement, prioritizing investments in areas that provide the strongest return. And in Document Technology, maintaining our leadership in mature markets is a priority so we can continue to benefit from their profitable annuity streams. As important, we're pursuing key growth markets including digital color and SMB to help boost top line and bottom line performance.", "Please let me turn it over to Luca, and I'll be back to wrap up and I'll open up the call for questions. Luca?", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing our earnings and then spend some time on our segment performance, cash flow and capital allocation.", "During the quarter revenue declined 1% on a constant-currency basis. We expected Document Technology revenue to be pressured, given a tough year-on-year compare, and in the end, a decline of 7% at constant currency was about 1 point below what we expected, driven by weakness in equipment revenue.", "However, segment margins remained healthy. In services, revenue continue to show strong growth at 6% constant currency, but margins were below expectations, driven by pressures on a number of government contracts, as well as lower volumes in some areas. As the result of these trends, we expect total revenues in Q4 to be flat year-over-year.", "The margin dynamics in Services drove an operating margin decline of 100 basis points. The bottom line impact was partially offset by improvement in technology margin and continued efficiency and productivity actions on the expense side.", "Restructuring was $18 million higher year-over-year, and as a reminder, is fully reflected in our adjusted results. Equity income was $9 million lower year-over-year, driven mainly by higher Fuji Xerox restructuring.", "Given the impacts of macro uncertainty, the government budgetary environment and declines in Document Technology, it's important that we continue to proactively manage the cost base of our business. As a result, we will also be taking a restructuring charge during Q4, which we are in the process of assessing, and will likely be in the $50 million to $100 million range. This action will put us in a stronger position entering 2013 and will address productivity opportunities across the enterprise, primarily in the Services segment.", "Adjusted EPS of $0.25 was down $0.01 from 2011 with the only adjustment to reported EPS being the amortization of intangibles.", "Moving on to segment performance, and we'll start with services. We continue to see good revenue growth, up 6% during Q3. BPO revenue was up 9%, ITO was up 6%, and both were pretty consistent with the first half.", "Document Outsourcing growth of 4% slowed a couple of points mainly due to lower volumes, but overall, it is showing good momentum. Year-to-date through September, BPO is up 10% constant currency, and the entire Services business is up 8%.", "The 2 areas I would like to spend more time discussing are signings and margins, beginning with signings. Although they were up 19% sequentially, signings came in below our expectations and were down around 20% year-over-year. Certainly, 2011 was an outstanding signings year with several mega deals. In contrast, this year, we have had smaller-sized deals, contract lengths have been shorter, and we are seeing customer decision delays caused by the increased economic uncertainty.  Q4, we'll have another difficult compare, but we expect to see sequentially higher new business signs, and we remain pleased with our high success rate on renewals.", "I also want to point out 3 positives that are not reflected in the signings data. Document Outsourcing signings, given reporting limitations, do not include Partner Print Services, which have been growing very strongly. Second, the improvement in renewal rate this year creates less of a headwind from contract losses as we move into 2013. And third, our pipeline is up 9% year-over-year, and it is at an all-time high.", "Turning to margins, which were well below our expectations, we had anticipated sequentially flat margins, but we experienced a sequential decline of 120 basis points due to 2 primary factors. Government was the largest driver of the sequential miss. Within government, we specifically had to absorb in Q3 the defunding of a signed contract, which we got a write-off. Additionally, budgetary forces are preventing government from moving forward on historically routine infrastructure advancements, which is lessening our add-on services opportunities. The second factor is lower volumes in some transactional areas.", "Given the view that this environment will not change in the near term, we will be looking to proactively manage our cost structuring investments to counter these pressures. Going forward, we expect sequential margin improvement in Q4 and for the foreseeable future, a Services segment margin range of 10% to 12%.", "Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 7% and document-related revenues, which includes Document Outsourcing, were down 4% at constant currency. The decline was driven by a 15% equipment revenue decline and a 7% decline in unbundled supplies.", "Equipment revenue decline reflects greater uncertainty in the macro environment with increasing pressure in the U.S. and continued weakness in Europe. It should also be noted that the trend in revenues is worsened by the prior year tsunami impacts, which disrupted supply in Q2 of 2011 and saw recovery in Q3. We estimate that this specific impact caused revenue deterioration between 1 to 2 points year-over-year in Q3.", "Looking at product segments. We saw good growth in entry installs from new products and relative strengths in SMB. High end had good color install growth, driven primarily by entry production products. Mix in high end should improve with the recent launches of our latest iGen device and the new Nuvera platform announced at Graph Expo.", "And lastly, mid-range was weaker, reflecting cautionary purchasing trends in large enterprises. This was the segment where we saw the greatest impact from the tsunami on the prior year compare.", "We expect equipment revenue to be pressured again in Q4 and therefore, for total revenue to be down mid single digits in Technology.", "Segment margin of 10.8% was up 50 basis points from 2011 and reflect a continued good cost and expense control, as well as a gain that we realized as a result of the sale of a portion of our finance receivables.", "Turning to the Key Metrics slide. Services signings have been lower this year driven by less mega deals and decision delays, as discussed. But our pipeline remains strong, up 9% year-over-year. And with the improved renewal rate performance, we continue to be well positioned for good revenue growth in 2013.", "Document Technology metrics remain relatively stable as does technology annuity revenue. Install growth is good overall. Machines in field is actually improving, and page volumes, although a bit weaker, driven by Europe, are still relatively in check.", "The one metric to turn negative was Color revenue largely as a function of the lower equipment revenue and the tsunami compare.", "If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review Q3 cash flow. Cash from operations were the source of $594 million, $228 million higher than Q3 of 2011. Through September, cash flow was $807 million, $124 million higher than in 2011. This is in line with our expectations, and we remain well on track for $2 billion to $2.3 billion of operating cash flow for the year.", "Looking specifically at the drivers in the quarter, net income and depreciation were a source of $627 million. Cash contributions to our global pension plans in Q3 were $73 million, which was $152 million lower than 2011, primarily due to the timing cadence this year versus last. Through September, pension contributions were $310 million versus $348 million in 2011. For the full year, they would be about $75 million lower year-over-year, driven by the change in funding requirements brought about by recent pension legislation in the U.S.", "Working capital, including finance receivables and operating leases, was essentially neutral to cash in the quarter. Within this, accounts receivable was a $390 million use of cash, and finance receivables was a $412 million source. The driver of this movement was a change in our lease financing strategy, which resulted in cash proceeds from a finance receivable sale of $314 million, offset for the most part by lower accounts receivable factoring.", "In 2012, we have undertaken a thorough review of our leasing strategy, which validated for us the operational value and strong financial contribution of our leasing business but also identified some opportunities in our approach relative to the diversity and matching of our funding to our leases. We have a plan over time to improve the efficiency of our funding and employing a modest amount of finance receivables sales such as we did this quarter is one element of that plan.", "Moving down the cash flow. We spent $140 million on CapEx consistent with our annual forecast of around $500 million and deployed $156 million on 3 acquisitions, which support our services expansion and SMB distribution strategies. Dividends paid were $69 million, and we repurchased 361 million of stock for a total of 718 million repurchased through Q3.", "On the next slide, I will cover in more detail our capital structure and our progress on capital allocation. Our Q3 ending debt balance of $9.4 billion reflect the typical seasonality of our business. We expect strong cash generation in Q4, as usual, and we continue to plan for $8.6 billion for year-end debt. The majority of our debt, $5.4 billion, of the total $9.4 billion debt balance is in support of our financing of Xerox equipment to our customers.  The finance debt is calculated assuming a 7:1 leverage of our finance assets of $6.2 billion. These finance assets represent committed revenue streams from our customers.", "Shifting to capital allocation. We are well on track to meet all our objectives for the year. Free cash flow will be in the guidance range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion and will be deployed in line with our original commitments. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 718 million shares and continue to expect to repurchase 900 million to 1.1 billion for the year. We will spend $243 million on acquisitions, and we expect to be in the $300 million to $400 million range full year. And dividend payments will be in the $300 million range. So we are confident to meet our commitments on all fronts. During our November investor conference, we will provide a view of our capital allocation strategy for 2013.", "In closing, we have seen increasing headwinds in areas more sensitive to the economy, and we will continue to adjust our business as appropriate to respond to these pressures while continuing to invest in the growth of our Services business and maintaining leadership in Technology.", "With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Luca. Let me quickly wrap up so that we can get to your questions. Until we finalize our restructuring plans for Q4, our earnings guidance does not include the expected charge. But it does comprehend our concerns that economic challenges will continue putting additional pressure on the business.", "For the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.33 to $0.35 per share. That brings us to a full year adjusted EPS of $1.07 to $1.09, which is at the low end of our previously stated guidance. This macro environment calls for resiliency and the ability to quickly adapt to marketplace dynamics. That's our focus, and we remain confident that our strategy is sound, and our execution will effectively deliver solid results.", "Growth in services, increase in annuity revenue, market share leadership, disciplined cost management and on track performance with past generation and capital allocation. These are all key drivers to build more value in our business, and we look forward to sharing more detail with you at the investor conference next month.", "With that, I thank you again for joining us today. As we get to your questions, I know you'll have to -- you'll want to dive deeper into trends especially in our Services business. So as in the past, Lynn Blodgett, President of Xerox services, will also join us for the Q&A session.", "Let's open it up for questions, and I'll field them and ask Luca and Lynn to chime in as well. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "I guess, Ursula, just to sort of take advantage of having Lynn and then, this is probably for you as well. I guess, could you bridge for us the Services operating margin this quarter? What was the impact from the government constraints and I guess the deal that you saw that kind of got shut down? And I guess you also mentioned in some of the press release comments, some contracts that were standing up. Are those -- is that a separate issue from what you referenced? And I have a follow-up, if I could.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Okay. So let me step back and just do a little bit of a Service walk through, and then I'll ask Lynn and Luca to add anything if they want to. So first on a year-over-year basis, margins, as I said, were down about 250 basis points. This is in line with what we expected, pretty much what we expected to happen as we stood up contracts from -- that we signed last year. So contract ramp is one of the pieces of margin pressure, and then what we saw in addition to that, which drove sequential margins to be lower than we had expected were 2 unique items. One is a contract, this is the first time that it's ever happened in the business that we can see that we had signed and committed with a state that was defunded after we had started to actually invest in that contract to stand it up. And we're still working with the state to actually come to some kind of a reasonable conclusion, but we took a write-off this quarter with that -- for that expense that was not matched with any revenue. In addition to that, and that's a significant hit but a unique area. This is something that, like I said, has never happened before. And this is not in an area that is what we would call discretionary. It was not in the Medicaid area or any of the nondiscretionary areas. This was in a segment of the business that the state actually had an option on, and they actually opted to move out. In addition to that, we were seeing kind of across the board, not at a very high level but hitting a little bit everywhere, is volumes are on transactional. Some of the transactional portion of our business is a little bit lighter than it would have been in the government alone. That alone, would not have been a big concern. We would have expected that in a down economy, but the combination of those 2 things, particularly at the end of the quarter, which we couldn't outrun, was the reason why we actually had sequential out of -- out-of-the-expected range margin performance in Services. I don't know if anything else that you want to say, Lynn, on that.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "I think that was well said.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, so that's what we saw in margins. What we expect on a go-forward basis for the remainder of the year and one of the reasons why we're taking the restructuring charge which like I said we'll -- like Luca said we'll spend more time on in the investor conference, is to align -- to make sure that we can align our cost on a more cautionary and restricted go-forward spending environment in 2013. As we do that, we'll be able to bring the margins more in line in a tighter range, probably not in the 11% to 13% range but probably in a 10% to 12% range, we'll be more short of our ability to actually deliver in that range.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "And I think, there's one other thing. What we're seeing and as Ursula said, Medicaid contract is not a discretionary program, and that funding is very rock-solid. There is some level of discretionary spending associated with those contracts like a system enhancement or whatever. And what we saw this quarter and what we expect to continue to see given the pressures on states is a little tightening or significant tightening on that discretionary spending. So what we're doing with the restructuring is to make sure that we are aligning the organization to deal with that new reality, and that's where we're moving forward on and confident that we can do it.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Murray, Carret & Co., LLC, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up if I could. Ursula, on the December quarter guidance, you don't have the charges in there yet. So should we assume that once you get the charges, a handle on the charges, I know you guys gave a range on the call. By my calculations it's something like $0.04 to $0.07 potentially in that range. Is it possible or is there potential that you could reduce the guidance once you get a better handle on what the charges are? I just want to make sure we understand what the context...", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, so the answer is yes. There is more than a likely potential that we will reduce the guidance. We will not be able to comprehend inside the numbers, a range of $0.03 to $0.06 that the $50 million to $100 million currently represent. We have to work further on this. I mean, we literally are going through the planning process today, now and as we speak. We'll have a lot more information at the investor conference but you should assume that the quarter 4 earnings that I talked about does not include and will be impacted by the restructuring charge.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "I guess, I want to follow up on the Services commentary and just sort of are you seeing revenue resets within contracts or -- I know you talked about lower volumes, but I guess, I'm still struggling with sort of what has changed with regard to how your contracts are priced or your positions in the last couple of years? And, Lynn, maybe if you could even give a little bit more perspective from the standpoint of the restructuring. One of the question I had is basically how much restructuring have you done in the past within ACS? I mean, is there sort of low-hanging fruit that will be easy to pick? Or it's always seemed like you've run a pretty tight ship. So how should we think about that?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So let me start -- let me open up with the question about Services resets, et cetera. No, we're not seeing a reset in contracts. We're not seeing contracts that have been signed in states across the board asking for new pricing structure or to open them up, not at all. Actually, not at all. What we are seeing though is contracts are generally made up of 3 different buckets. One is the basic contract that you saw -- and maybe 2 different markets, the basic contract that you sign, State of California, State of Texas, whatever it is, structural contracts, for example, in Medicaid. That contract is priced and signed and baked into our ongoing operations. In addition to that, generally almost all the time, there are additional add-ons that come after that contract is signed. Once the state knows what they're doing and what we're doing, they ask for additional add-on work to upgrade a system, to refine a collection process, to find fraud, whatever the add-ons would be. What we're seeing is not the core contract changing at all. That's contractual, which is good. But what we're seeing is those little add-ons that would normally come, that are normally baked into how we would actually manage the business are long, are harder in coming. So harder in coming, so they're not doing as many of them, longer to get if they are doing them, it's a lot of work to get them to agree to do them, or not happening at all. And so those -- that's the part that we have to adjust to, this normal work that we would have seen outside of the discretionary portion. We're now going to have to assume that, that work for the foreseeable future will be significantly constrained for states, and that's what we're actually taking a restructuring for. As far as the restructuring for services, I'll let Lynn go into it, but for the company in the last couple of years and as we've taken restructuring, it has been focused almost solely on our Technology business and getting our Technology business infrastructure aligned more to the realities of the revenue on a go-forward basis. So we have not taken since ACS has come on and as part of Xerox, restructuring has focused heavily on the Services business.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, I think that the issue of us running a relatively tight ship, I think that's true. And I think that's been true for a long time. This has been a very good exercise. We don't like the fact that there isn't as much discretionary money there. But what we have done because of the reality is that we've gone through the organization sort of top to bottom and said, \"Okay, even though we have a good, a very good organization, what can we do to make it better?\" And so we've looked at a very methodical approach to spans some layers and reporting structures and have just gone through and scrubbed the organization. So when we finish this, we will be far more competitive. We've been able to take out costs in some areas that actually have surprised some of our operating people where they say, \"We thought we had that thing tuned about as well as we could,\" and we found, by going through this methodical approach, that there were things that we could improve upon. So we think the organization is good, but we feel like there are reasonable things that we're doing now that will make us more competitive that will deal with this problem of the discretionary and when that restores, which I believe it will in the future, we'll be that much more better positioned.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Just one follow-up, if I could. If you could talk a little bit about the trends you're seeing on the Technology side, because, obviously, all the questions have been focused on Services, just in terms of demand in Europe and North America, and maybe linearity in the quarter. And then that's my question.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Okay. Great. So I'll do this quickly. What we're seeing is a continued downward pressure on equipment sales in Technology. The thing that actually we didn't see in quarter 2 that we did see in quarter 3, and we expect to see in quarter 4 and it's not totally that surprising to me when I look out at most of my clients who are reporting around the same kind of environment that we're reporting in is equipment sales in North America across the board in large enterprises in particular, in government in particular are definitely stressed. Europe continues to be very weak. We're not seeing a lot of uptick there. And if anything, we're seeing a little bit of additional headwind. DMO developing economies continue to be pretty stable, a little bit of weakness, but I mean pretty stable. They're outperforming all of the other regions. U.S. is the place that we saw a fairly significant downturn in equipment sales, actually. The equipment sales performance in North America starting in the middle of the quarter and definitely towards the end of the quarter definitely accelerated from a downward perspective. So we're seeing pressure there. From a competitive standpoint, we're not seeing -- we're seeing the same -- the good news is everybody's facing the same environment so we're not losing ground. As a matter of fact, we still hold the #1 equipment revenue share. We're still a leader in color, et cetera, but we're seeing a dampened environment just across the board in general in large enterprises. SMB, a little bit better, and large enterprise is definitely pressured.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Could you talk a little bit more about the factoring of your finance receivables? It looks like it was responsible for over $300 million of the cash flow. Is this something you're going to be doing from now on? And I got to say like you're factoring finance receivables, it just doesn't seem to be something a company with healthy cash flow would need to do and I was wondering what went into that decision and how you balance that.", "Luca Maestri", "Ben, I'll answer that. As I thought I had explained during my remarks, the reason why we did that transaction is because we really did a very careful review of our leasing business during the first 6 months of 2012. And we clearly identified an opportunity to fund this business better, and increase the diversity of the sources for that business and do a better matched funding of our leases. So we implemented this transaction in Q3. As I explained before, as part of this change in strategy, we certainly generated cash from the sale of finance receivables. We generated significantly less cash from the typical factoring that we do. We, at the end of the day, when you look at working capital in full, it was actually flat. So we did not generate cash to working capital during the quarter. And the gain that we realized actually proves the fact that the funding that we were able to obtain on this transaction is significantly better than the funding that we were able to obtain previously. So as we go forward, we will continue to look at different possibilities to optimize the funding of the leasing portfolio, and it's certainly not an issue that is around our ability to meet our range in terms of cash flow, nothing to do with it.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "How are we supposed to take these gains? Because you guys can obviously do these transactions. This one was $0.01. In addition to the cash flow, I mean, if services margins continue to be weak, is this where we're going to get the earnings power to make up for it? What's the philosophy behind these gains? I mean, it's $0.01 this quarter, how many is it going to be in upcoming quarters in terms of these gains, and is this what we're going to use to offset the Services margin pressures?", "Luca Maestri", "It's really nothing to do with that. We're really looking at how we can fund a leasing portfolio that is a very profitable business for us, and it's a great way for us to be more competitive as we go to market with our customers. And so we're going to be looking at ways to reduce the funding cost over time, and it will depend on the structures that we're going to be able to find in the market. They will depend on the geographies that we're going to be looking at. So we don't have a firm plan around this, and it's totally independent from how other segments may be doing or not. And as you know, we report Services performance completely separate from Technology, and so we are very focused on the measures that we're willing to take on the Services business.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I just wanted a clarification on Services. What -- so I assume it's California Medicaid and how much more business do you have with California that's at risk? And I guess why wouldn't every other state kind of see what California's doing and do the same thing given these tough times? And then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula M. Burns", "By the way -- yes, so I just want to make sure we're very clear. We did not refer to California Medicaid as the state that had anything to do with the defunding of the contract. That has nothing to do with California Medicaid, nothing at all. It's really important to understand that. I don't want California to get pissed at us before...", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, I'm sorry. That was mentioned as an example, I guess?", "Ursula M. Burns", "We didn't actually say anything about California, but California is a very big contract, but they are not defunding anything at all. They're -- I'll have Lynn...", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, I think absolutely the defunding was at a different state and...", "Ursula M. Burns", "And it was not a Medicaid contract.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, not Medicaid. It was a project that would be considered as discretionary. This has never happened to us before, and it was a very singular kind of experience or event. But where you could be thinking about California is that we did say that discretionary, what would be systems maintenance, some of the sort of discretionary system improvements that we normally see in our Medicaid contracts, we're not seeing as much of that, and that would apply to the state of California.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Well, I apologize. Just the question though still is I think has some valid points is that what state was this and could it go into every contract you have with that state? Because I assume that you talk to each other.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, the answer is we're still working with the state so I prefer to not actually state what state it was and will not. And the likelihood of it going into other contracts is -- I mean, it's infinitesimally small. This is a very unique situation with a very unique state with some very unique politics in that state. So, and we are -- by the way, we've gone through our contracts. We're pretty sure that we do not have an issue that is going to spread across the contracts that we have.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So you guys have given us a ton of data here on what's going on in Services, but I don't want to beat a dead horse but frankly, there's still obviously a lot of confusion here. And I think I'd like to focus more on how we should think about your government exposure in general. Government and state and local conditions have been very weak for a while. This has been a concern for investors for a while, and we've seen other companies that have taken hits on in over the past year and past few quarters. But the argument for Xerox had been that your Services business wasn't as exposed to this dynamic primarily due to the unique nature of the Services model and the types of contracts you had exposure to. So can you help us understand what really changed in this most recent quarter that suddenly impacted profitability, and why it was a surprise? And I guess, perhaps helping to answer that, can you give us an idea of what percentage of your government-exposed Services business is what you would define as discretionary?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I'll have Lynn take it.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes, I think it would be -- as far as the overall sort of sensitivity to economic conditions and our government portfolio, I think it's really a tribute to the resiliency of the portfolio that even though government, state governments' budgets have been under pressure, as you said, for quite some time, and we have been able to really continue in the face of that pressure. What has happened quickly was this defunding of a contract was an event, unanticipated event that, as we say, we've not seen before and don't expect to see that. And it was not one of our discretionary programs, it was in a -- it was in a discretionary program not a nondiscretionary. And as far as the percentage of revenue in our Government business that is -- that we would consider discretionary, this is an estimate on my part, but it's certainly less than 10%.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Most of our state work is in -- large bulks of the revenue are in the health care sector, and that's generally mandated by some law or some edict, and that's where we participate a lot. California's there, Texas is there, these kinds of contracts are there. We do have contracts though, smaller percentage of it about 10%, 15% of them that are other things. I mean, we do call-center work for people that are not associated with the mandatory side of the business, and those would be more susceptible to this kind of work. But even with that susceptibility, we've never seen it happen before. It turns out that we do have, as a business, a very strong position in government. We provide services, a lot of them nondiscretionary services to government. And as governments are pressured, we have to pay significantly more attention to that portfolio of business. No doubt about it. But as the largest buyer in the United States, it's really -- it's very difficult for us to figure out a way to run a successful business without serving them. And up until this one contract, we've served them very well. And even in this quarter, we're serving them very, very well. Revenue is growing. Our participation in contracts are growing, and we just have to make sure that we pay very, very close attention to and count on downward pressure from the discretionary portion of the government budget. And that's what we're doing, and that's what we're going to do with our restructuring charge.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So just to clarify the defunding issue that Ben was asking about, you generally view that as a one-time issue but the discretionary portion of the portfolio is the reason why you're adding this restructuring and lowering the targeted margin range for the intermediate term?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Absolutely. And one of the things that we're -- we're just seeing a lot -- the headwind from just a softer economy, it's a bad thing to say but it gives you the opportunity to step back and say, \"Whoa.\" If this is the trend that we're going to see for quarter 4 and 2013, which is what we're assuming, let's go back and let's literally start to scrub everything, scrub it down and as we start to see opportunities arise and expansion, we will match that expansion but we can't assume that we're going to have a lot more upside in 2013. Revenue is holding very well in services across the board in all lines. BPO, ITO and in Document Outsourcing, we're seeing good revenue. We're continuing to expand around the world, Europe and Latin America. And we are very, very, very focused on assuring that the biggest contracts for sure, but all of them have the right cost to match the revenue on the minimum level. So what the restructuring will do is actually take out any service provision that we have, any cost that we have associated with an upside, we're going to manage these things to be very, very tight. And that will give us some breathing room in a tight economy. That's the strategy going forward. It will be interesting to say one last thing on this. We watched the quarter as the months went by, so month 1 in the quarter, month 2 in the quarter. This problem that we had with this particular contract we worked till the last day of the quarter. Literally, we didn't know that we would not end up on the right side of this until the very, very end of the quarter and which is, which goes to show just how tightly this piece of business actually came forward. This is not a widespread move that we saw. We were actually working this till the very end.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gaurav Gupta with BMO Capital Markets.", "Gaurav Gupta", "This is Gaurav for Keith Bachman. I have a couple of questions as well. I guess the first question is on the services but more on the signings front. I know this quarter, the signings have improved significantly sequentially. So I guess the question is, given all the commentary about the weak economic environment impacting both the government or the commercial side, are you seeing any changes in the competitive environment? And what I mean by that is any change in the structuring of the deal or the pricing? And within the category, are you seeing more strength in the BPO, ITO. I guess you mentioned the pipeline is up 9% and what does it imply about the margin guidance for the next year? Is it actually more on the 10% side versus the 12%?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So there's like 5 questions in there. I'll start with Luca on -- in the beginning and then we'll kind of walk down the question.", "Luca Maestri", "So I think I'll try to give you a few points. Yes, I think the increase in the pipeline represent the fact that we are quite competitive in the marketplace and the fact that there have been decision delays. So that decisions that we thought would get to a contract signing during the Q2 and also Q3 have been postponed, right? So but those are not bids that we have lost to competitors, and therefore, the pipeline has been growing. Across the board, we see relatively -- of course, pricing is -- because of the tight environment, pricing has some level of pressure. We see that probably, particularly in Document Outsourcing in our NPS [ph] dates, particularly in large enterprises, there is more pricing competition than maybe we've seen in the past. And that is what gets reflected, of course, on the services margin side. And that's why it is so important for us to adjust our cost structure accordingly to reflect the existing environment.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "And I think the other thing that has impacted us is that we have not had this year the kind of mega deal volume that we had last year. Last year was a record for us, and this year, the deals have been typically a little bit smaller. And if it's not a mega deal, it tends to be a little bit shorter. So the duration has been a little shorter, the size is a little smaller, and that has had an impact. One thing that I think we need to make sure people understand is that we talk a lot about renewal rates. And last quarter, there were a lot of questions about it. Renewal rates are as critical to growth as bookings. And this year, we had higher renewal rates than last year to the tune of about $110 million of additional revenue that we didn't lose, if you can think of it that way. So that essentially offsets a significant decline in bookings. Now we want bookings to be as high as we can get them, but the positive renewal rate will help us with growth even if bookings are a little bit lower than they were last year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Alban Gashi with Credit Suisse.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I guess, just looking again at the services margins that you guys have for the quarter, it's about 1.2 percentage points lower sequentially. And if we look sort of some of the things you outlined in the government as being more onetime or due to the write-offs, how do we sort of think of the 1.2% allocated between sort of the more of the transactions and the write-offs and the government versus sort of more longer structural trends within the sector and then sort of how can you guys get back to your historical range of 11%, 13% for the segment?", "Luca Maestri", "That's a good question. When you think about this write-off that we take, we should be thinking it was a number that was over $10 million. And so when you think about percentage points, you would say there was a 120-basis-point decline. It was possibly half-and-half, half of it was kind of write-offs that we had committed to take in the quarter, and the rest is this more systemic issue that we need to address through restructuring.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. That's great. And then also last quarter, you sort of talked about new business signings as being more of an area that you guys like to focus on. That was up last quarter, and then you also indicated that next quarter should be an increase from the current quarter. What was it in the current quarter?", "Ursula M. Burns", "New business signings in the current quarter were weaker than they were in the previous quarter. We did have good renewal rates this quarter, but new business signings were down. Signings across the board were down. And I just want to make sure that you heard what both Luca and Lynn said. We're not losing these signings to competition. It's literally they're taking a lot longer to sign now. So the pipeline is big. The pipeline grew by about 9%, and what we're seeing is people taking a lot more time to -- both large enterprises and government are taking a lot more time to make a decision on a contract. But they're still up and open, and we're not losing them to competition but --  and they should be higher in quarter 4 or this quarter, the current quarter.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "And they actually were year-over-year as Ursula said, they were down. But sequentially from Q2 to Q3, they were up about 19%, and we expect that trend of increasing sequentially to continue in the fourth quarter.", "Ursula M. Burns", "But it is a very, very important metric and one that we keep an eye on. And we want to make sure that if we don't sign that it stays in the pipeline and we don't lose it. And that's the key thing. But the trend for contract negotiations and contract just nibbling back and forth is definitely one that's going towards the longer side not towards the shorter side.", "Alban Gashi - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's it. I guess just one final question on the inventory levels on the technology side sort of what are you guys seeing on the channel I guess just globally?", "Luca Maestri", "Inventory levels were very much in line with our historical ranges. We didn't have anything particular on the inventory side.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "My first question goes back to this problem contract. I'm curious how this happens. My understanding that terms and conditions are pretty well set in the original contract. I'm just wondering around the scrutiny you place on these deals and whether or not you're taking outsized risk to close deals in this tough environment.", "Ursula M. Burns", "The answer to this latter part of the question is we are not. We do not take outsized risks. But we are extremely focused on that independent of size. One of the things that we have learned we learned it from ACS, we learned it from our Document Outsourcing business is that Ts and Cs and risk review is a big portion of the management of this kind of a business. So we are not taking outsized risk. I cannot get into all of the details. The more I get into the more specific, it will become and the more -- we'll probably have a public disclosure that I don't want to have until we actually manage our way through this with the state. Suffice it to say that we don't take outsized risk. It is very, very unusual. We think it is unusual as well, which is why we're still working with the state, and it is not something that should be considered to be like a natural outcome. The terms and conditions are generally written in a way that we can actually -- almost always written in a way that we have recourse.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Okay. And just a follow-up. Thinking about the 2013 model, you're guiding to about flat revenue in Q4. Bookings and services have been tracking down north of 20%, and you have some tough compares from a revenue standpoint, et cetera. Do you think you can hold revenue flat in 2013 or should we expect revenue to decline?", "Luca Maestri", "Of course, we're going to give you total visibility in mid-November when we have the investor conference. But at this point of the planning process, we feel pretty confident that the revenue dynamics both in services and technology will continue. And so we feel confident that we're going to be on the positive side of revenue growth getting into 2013. Again, I think it's important to keep in mind revenue -- renewal rates have been good this year, we got a strong pipeline and there is very...", "Ursula M. Burns", "Revenue is there. I mean [indiscernible].", "Luca Maestri", "There is money to be allocated to acquisitions as well.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Right, exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I have 2 questions, if I could. Just following up on Services. It's been a pretty hot topic throughout the year in terms of the targets or the pursuit of improved operating margin and also gross margin. And some of your commentary earlier today seems to almost suggest that some of this perceived weakness here in the third quarter was actually anticipated, but we didn't really get that sense in the last earnings call. So can you kind of help us reconcile that commentary, please?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, please.", "Luca Maestri", "So when we had the call, the Q2 call, we talked about sequentially being more or less flat going into Q3. And what you will see is that we missed by 120 basis points, which as I explained before when you break it down, about half of that miss was driven by one-off charges. And we talked about particularly this defunding of a contract, and the rest was related to these additional government pressures around discretionary spending, change orders in particular and some lower volumes in some transactional areas. That's what happened. I think very clearly we are disappointed with the level Services margins have gone and the miss is about 120 basis points, versus is what we told you 3 months ago.", "Ursula M. Burns", "But it's important to note, Mark, that we had told you that what we are tracking to is we knew that we'll have -- we thought that we would have sequential expansion, from quarter 2 to quarter 3, but we knew we would have year-over-year pressure, right? So we thought it would be about in the range quarter 2 to quarter 3 about flat, but we knew we would have sequential pressure on margins -- I mean, a year-over-year pressure on margins, and so that part is not changing. We're not -- we are seeing the year-over-year pressure. The difference that we saw this quarter, which is -- disappointing is a mild word, which is angry, is the fact that we actually had one contract that we had to literally take a write-off on and that we have some pressure in some of the transactional volume perspective. If it was only transactional volume, I would actually have felt a little bit better about the quarter.", "Mark A Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate that. And then my other question is just around the magnitude of the deterioration. Clearly, your tone in your commentary is a lot more marked here in terms of the incremental deterioration since the July earnings call. I just wanted to get a sense in terms of especially in the U.S. sector both for government and large enterprise, when did this all kind of start to manifest? What month? And then as you went through the rest of the quarter and then into this month of October, has it stabilized or is it getting worse? And then kind of a follow-up to that is, are you starting to see some customers now as a result of the macro pressures drive to a reduced number of preferred service vendors to try to contain costs?", "Ursula M. Burns", "So let me start with the first. We've seen weakening of the U.S. economy throughout the quarter. So in the first, I don't know, we can like to say the first month or the second month or third month but by the time September rolled around, it was very, very clear that we were headed south from a U.S. economy, and then it was starting to become clearer even earlier in the quarter. I've spent a little bit of time with other CEOs and with other business leaders, and it is clear to me that we are seeing a dampening of enthusiasm in North America or in the U.S. for sure. We see continued weakness in Europe. So I think that we saw that expand throughout the quarter, and we're expecting it to hold for quarter 4. We're hoping that some settling of the economy comes in the beginning of the year, but we're not counting on it. That's that. As far as your second part, the second part of your question about I think it was, are we ready or are we prepared, was that?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "This idea of, are customers wanting to consolidate suppliers. I think that, that has been a movement for quite some time. It's expensive to manage a large portfolio of suppliers. And so that idea of consolidating to a few larger and smaller number of suppliers has been going on now for 2 or 3 years. And we haven't seen a marked increase or decline in that.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Ursula, a question for you as you kind of lead your company during this challenging economic time. When you look at the strategy of leading them, is there anything if we continue in this challenging state that you're looking at changing or refocusing or anything that's going to impact your cash flows? Because this year was also pretty challenging. Just kind of as you lead the company, can you give us kind of the big picture of what you see for the direction for them?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, I think that there is a duality here that you -- that I have to employ when I lead a company of this size and the varying nature of the businesses that we're in. One is to make sure that we're clear about where the opportunities lie and not get ourselves too wrapped up in all of the downside. We have to know where growth is happening, and we have to invest to pursue that growth. And we know where it's happening. In Document Technology, that's a predefined set of either solution types or client types, small or midsized businesses, developing economies, color, we know that. We have to literally focus on those, not get confused about those, and move our resourcing, our funding, our focus away from areas that are not really growing. That doesn't mean we abandon clients or anything, but we actually have to make sure that we weight our investments towards growth. And on services, we have to be literally very methodical and not too impatient, which is not a good -- for that -- one of my strengths, not too impatient and skip over opportunities. Our Services business, it's relatively new for us. The good news is we have an experienced team. One of the first things we have to do was stabilize the business as we brought it on board and start to grow revenue to apply the strength that we had from Xerox to ACS and make revenue growth possible. We have been able to do that. We are very confident about our ability to do that. Second thing we had to do is make sure that we take some of these very large contracts, which we have signed more of them than ACS had ever signed before. We have to actually get those stood up and stabilized, move on that path, and then we have to drive towards margin expansion. And that's that, and literally really not focus on the other areas of the business. So disinvest from contract sell off businesses that are not really core to us or profitable. So focus on opportunities and be kind of brutal and ruthless on things that are not aligned toward growth and not get ourselves too wrapped up in anything too short term or too, too long term. So that's -- and that's the way that you would manage this business and you have to focus on the people and focus on their customers. If you do those 3 things, you got it made in the shade. It's a difficult economy right now, but I think we're doing a pretty good job in navigating our way through it. Thank you for your time and for all of your interest. I really do encourage you to spend some time with us at the investor conference at the New York Stock Exchange on November 13, and we'll be able to get into more detail about the business then.

She is joined by Luca Maestri, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which by their nature address matters that are in future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. During the fourth quarter, we delivered results that reflect consistent progress on our strategy. Our shift to a services-led growth portfolio is paying off. Services revenue now represents 52% of our total revenue and is growing at a steady pace.", "Through improved margins, our bottom line is benefiting more from this top line growth. We have a clear understanding of the market dynamics in our Document Technology business. It remains a very profitable cash-generating operation. We're maximizing its profit by lowering the cost base and shifting investments to focused areas of growth.", "And we're generating strong operating cash flow, $2.6 billion in 2012. This gives us flexibility to invest for growth and build shareholder value. We bought back more than $1 billion in Xerox stock in 2012, and share repurchase will remain part of our balanced approach to capital allocation.", "Xerox is a company that is going through a seismic transformation. 2012 was a year of alignment. Getting our costs aligned with our services-focused business model, getting our investments aligned with key priorities, getting our diverse portfolio aligned with market opportunities and getting our operations aligned to address these opportunities. We're doing this through a customer-centric approach that takes full advantage of our brand, innovation and global scale. I feel good about our progress, and I am confident that we will deliver strong results in 2013.", "Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.30. As planned, adjusted earnings include $0.05 of restructuring. Adjusted EPS exclude $0.04 related to amortization of intangibles, resulting in GAAP EPS of $0.26. Total revenue of $5.9 billion was down 1% or flat in constant currency. Growth came from our Services business, up 7% in the quarter and reflecting solid results across the board.", "Business Process Outsourcing revenue grew 8%. IT Outsourcing was up 15%, and Document Outsourcing was up 2%. Segment margin also improved in Services. At 11.2%, Services margin was up 90 basis points. This is very good progress, and puts our margins right in the range of our expectations.", "Signings in Q4 were lower year-over-year. With the nature of our business, any 90-day cycle will bring ups and downs, especially factoring in prior year compares and long purchasing cycles. Considering the nearly $11 billion in total business signings during 2012, I remain confident that our pace of signings to date aligns well with our future revenue growth expectations.", "In our Document Technology business, revenue declined 8%. We made disciplined decisions in 2012 to be conservative in how we manage this business. Due to the economic uncertainty across most regions, we put our focus on reducing the cost base while expanding distribution through indirect channels. As a result, segment margin in Document Technology improved. At 12.3%, it's well above our target range and gives us flexibility to make important investments this year.", "We're about to launch a refresh of products in the first quarter. And we're ramping up marketing investments while broadening our channel partnerships, positioning us better to pursue the growth opportunities in small and midsized businesses. As a result, we expect to see improving trends in install level and equipment sale revenue this year.", "Operating margin in the fourth quarter improved 30 basis points to 10.3%. Gross margin was 31.5%. Selling, administrative and general expenses were down $56 million and represents 18.5% of revenue. We generated $1.8 billion in cash from operations during the fourth quarter, $2.6 billion for the year, including the sale of certain finance receivables, and we allocated $334 million of that quarterly cash to buy back shares.", "The fundamentals of our strategy are delivering as expected. We're managing our services business for growth. In Document Technology, we're maintaining leadership in the profitable growth segments while benefiting from the overall profitability of this mature business. As a result, Services now represents 52% of our total revenue, up from 48% just one year ago. This mix shift will continue, with Services growing to 2/3 of our revenue by 2017. That growth then fuels our annuity stream, which is now 83% of our total revenue. It's up 3% in constant currency during the quarter. And during 2012, we generated $18.9 billion in recurring revenue.", "Equipment sales are becoming a much smaller percentage of our business, down 13% this quarter, they are the most impacted by economic and industry trends. We expect the equipment sales trends to improve modestly this year. We're launching new products, and we're targeting investments that will boost our share of the digital color and SMB markets.", "Summing up the quarter, the strong growth in Services and consistent profitability of our Document Technology business generated significant operating cash flow and contributed to earnings that met our expectations.", "Before I turn it over to Luca, let me take a moment to offer my thanks to him. As you know, Luca is leaving Xerox on February 28. He's been a fantastic business partner and is a steadfast supporter of our business strategy. I know his contributions to Xerox will serve his successor, our company and our shareholders well for a long term. Thank you, Luca.", "Luca Maestri", "Thank you, Ursula, for the very kind words, and good morning, everyone. I will begin by reviewing earnings, and then we'll cover our 2 segments, cash flow and capital allocation.", "During the quarter and also for the full year, revenue was flat at constant currency. We continue to see good growth in Services, up 7% in Q4, and as Ursula said, now representing 52% of total revenue, while Technology remains pressured and was down 8%.", "An area of focus for us during Q4 was Services margin, and we made really good progress. This improvement in Services also drove overall margin improvement. In total, operating margin at 10.3% was up 30 basis points year-over-year. Gross margins were lower because of the higher mix of Services revenue, but this was more than offset by continued improvement in SG&A and R&D.", "As planned, restructuring in the quarter was higher year-over-year and came in at $93 million, as we initiated actions to improve the Services cost structure and maintained Technology profitability. For the year, restructuring of $153 million was $120 million higher than in 2011. The 2012 actions have been taken in order to position us for margin improvement in 2013, and we will continue to manage our cost base proactively going forward, with ongoing modest restructuring initiatives.", "Equity income grew $9 million, driven by profit growth at Fuji Xerox, and adjusted tax rate was 23% in the quarter, lower by about 3 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.30 in Q4 was lower in 2011 by $0.03, and full year adjusted EPS of $1.03 was lower by $0.05. These results reflect the negative impact of the higher restructuring in 2012 and the pension curtailment gain of $107 million, which we recognized in Q4 of 2011.", "Moving on to the Services segment. Revenue growth came in at 7% in Q4, BPO was up 8%, ITO was up 15% and Document Outsourcing up 2%. We are seeing steady growth in BPO all year. And in Q4, we had strong results in customer care, state government and transportation. ITO revenue really accelerated this quarter as we began to see the full benefits from the very strong 2011 signings. Document Outsourcing growth was somewhat lower in Q4, impacted by some decision delays in the enterprise space.", "Signings in the quarter were lower year-over-year. This was fully expected, as ITO had 2 megadeals in 2011 that made the compare extremely challenging. BPO and Document Outsourcing signings were essentially flat year-over-year. And in total, Q4 had the highest new business signings of the year from an annual recurring revenue perspective. The average contract length was approximately 3 years for BPO and ITO, considerably lower than our historical average of approximately 5 years and dampened the signings number when looking at total contract value.", "The BPO/ITO renewal rate in Q4 was below target of 79% and reflected some timing factors and price discipline. For the year, however, renewal rate was 85%, which is in our target range and 5 points higher than 2011.", "We remain confident that we will continue to see mid to high single-digit Services revenue growth in 2013. As we discussed at our investor conference, our recurring revenue model provides us with good line of sight to expected revenues. And even though overall signings this year have been lower, we have achieved what we expected from new business signings and renewal rates in order to support our growth plans going forward.", "Turning to margins. Services segment margin of 11.2% increased 90 basis points year-over-year and 180 basis points sequentially, ahead of our expectations. This sequential margin increase was driven by the initial benefit from our cost actions, the absence of negative one-offs, improvements in Document Outsourcing and some level of seasonality.", "Year-over-year, the improvement came mainly from Document Outsourcing where we benefited from lower SG&A. We also had good margin improvement in a number of BPO lines of business, including state government services, customer care and transportation. We continue to expect to be in the 10% to 12% range for the full year, and we expect Q1 margin to be lower than Q4 but modestly better on a year-over-year basis.", "So overall, a good quarter for Services, with welcome progress on margins and continued strong revenue growth, which positions us well as we enter 2013.", "Let's now turn to the Technology segment. Technology revenue was down 8%. Revenue decline continue to be driven by lower equipment revenue, which was down 14% and was impacted by the soft macro environment and continued focus on segment profitability. As we look ahead, we have a significant mid-range and entry production color product announcement coming next month, and we fully expect activity and equipment revenue to show improving trends as we move through the year.", "In terms of product segments, good growth continued in entry A4 products as more purchases are moving to multifunction devices in this segment. Mid-range activity was down in the quarter, partially because the upcoming product launches are centered around this category. And high end continued to show good color growth, driven by entry production and iGen, which offsets the secular decline in black-and-white.", "Segment margin of 12.3% was up 60 basis points from 2011, well above our target range, reflecting cost and expense control and a gain that we realized as a result of the sale of a portion of our finance receivables. As we transition into 2013, we believe we have set reasonable expectations for Technology, with mid-single-digits revenue declines and margins within our target range of 9% to 11%. We believe that our opportunities to support these objectives, including new product launches, recent favorable currency trends and easier compares in Europe.", "Turning to the key metrics slide. I've already commented on much of this data. But in summary, total Services signings for the year had been clearly lower, but the underlying trends are more positive than the decline would imply. We actually signed 7% more deals in BPO and ITO than in 2011, but there were fewer megadeals and contract lengths were shorter. This, combined with lower renewal opportunities, resulted in lower signings. However, as explained before, we did meet the new business annual revenue and renewal rate targets needed to support our 2013 revenue plans, and our pipeline remains very strong and it is up 6% year-over-year.", "Document Technology metrics remain relatively stable, in line with annuity revenue. Install growth was softer in the quarter but should improve with the new product launches. MIF continues to grow and page volumes are still relatively in check. Color revenue was weak, driven by lower equipment revenue mix.", "If we now turn to the next slide, I will take a moment to review cash flow. Cash from operations in Q4 was strong at $1.8 billion, in line with seasonality and resulted in $2.6 billion for the full year. This exceeded our guidance of $2 billion to $2.3 billion due to an additional finance receivables sale in Q4, which contributed a net $269 million to cash flow when considering the natural runoff of the sold receivables.", "Cash contributions to our global pension plans were $54 million in Q4, $364 million full year, a $62 million reduction versus 2011. We expect pension contributions in 2013 to be more than $100 million lower than in 2012, driven by the change in funding requirements brought about by recent pension legislation in the U.S.", "Working capital was a significant contribution to cash in the quarter, in line with usual seasonality. In particular, inventory was a source of $128 million for the quarter and flat for the year. Accounts payable was a source of $346 million in the quarter and a use of $86 million for the year, and accounts receivable was a source of $365 million in Q4 and a use of $306 million for the year, which was $390 million worse year-over-year. This reflects lower contribution from factoring compared to 2011 and growth in our Services business.", "Finance receivables generated $947 million in 2012. $580 million of this contribution comes from the 2 finance receivables sales that we did in the year, one in Q3 and one in Q4. The remaining $367 million comes from the runoff of our finance portfolio due to the lower equipment revenue.", "We spent $513 million on CapEx for the year, which is fully in line with our guidance, and we deployed $276 million towards acquisitions. Dividends paid were $255 million for the year, and we repurchased 1,050,000,000 of stock during the year. For 2013, we continue to expect $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion in cash flow from operations. We expect lower pension funding requirements. But finance receivables will be a lower contributor to cash by approximately $500 million, due to fewer collections associated with the 2012 finance receivables sales and a lower natural runoff of the portfolio, given our expectation of better equipment activity. We expect the rest of working capital to be essentially flat year-over-year.", "The next slide covers in more detail our capital structure and capital allocations plan. We ended the year with $8.5 billion in debt, about $100 million lower than planned. Our cash ending balance was over $1.2 billion, $344 million higher than at the end of 2011. The greater debt reduction and higher cash balance from the strong cash flow in Q4 position us well to meet our capital structure objectives for 2013, which include retiring the $400 million senior note that comes due in May.", "Turning to capital allocation. We met our 2012 objectives, with the largest portion of our cash flow going to share repurchase. For the year, we spent $1,050,000,000 on the repurchase of 146 million shares, reducing shares by 114 million on a net basis. This represents a 9% net reduction in common shares outstanding for the year.", "We are maintaining the 2013 capital allocation guidance that was provided at the investor conference in November, which includes at least $400 million in debt reduction; up to $500 million in acquisitions, which will be largely focused on the Services business; dividend payments of $300 million, which reflects the planned 35% dividend increase beginning in April; and share repurchases of at least $400 million.", "So in conclusion, overall, a very good quarter across the board. I have great confidence, great confidence that Xerox is very well positioned both strategically and financially to take advantage of the growth opportunities in Services and to strengthen our leadership position in Technology during 2013.", "With that, I will hand it back to Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "2012 presented its share of challenges. Thank you, Luca. But it also gave us an opportunity to refine our business model and improve operational efficiency, all while growing our Services business. This progress gives me confidence in our ability to deliver a strong 2013.", "For the first quarter, we expect adjusted earnings of $0.23 to $0.25 per share. Our guidance for the full year remains unchanged. We expect adjusted EPS of $1.09 to $1.15, and our strategy remains very sound. We're shifting to a Services-led growth portfolio. You see it in our results every quarter. We're maintaining our leadership in Document Technology, product and platform news next month will demonstrate our commitment to this profitable business.", "With improving margins, cost controls and steady growth, we'll consistently expand earnings and generate strong cash. With that, we'll continue to take a very balanced approach to our capital allocation, which creates value for our shareholders.", "That's a good place for me to end. Before we open it up for questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, Head of Investor Relations.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Luca today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. It provides more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the lines for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Ursula and Lynn, can you talk a bit about -- bit more about the Services business sort of where you think you are with restructuring, maybe some comments about your conservative outlook on deal pricing? And then I'm curious especially, Lynn, given your history, if you think the trend of the lack of megadeals is something that is just sort of cyclical or is this a change in how customers are thinking about things? And then I have a follow-up on Technology.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Thanks, Shannon. As far as the restructuring activity, we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. We're not finished, as we said in the investor conference. We're really focused on cost. We have a great revenue model, and just need to make sure that our costs stay in line. So we have more work to do, and we'll see that through the balance of 2013. But we made really good progress in this quarter. As far as deal pricing, there's always downward pressure on deals. That's just part of our model. We know that when we come up for renewal or when we're bidding a new deal that the pricing will be down. And these percentages that we have seen in the past aren't changing dramatically. So there hasn't been a significant change there. As far as megadeals, we didn't see -- last year, we had 8 megadeals and -- excuse me, in 2011, we had 8 megadeals. In 2012, we had 3, and that was a significant change, primarily in the ITO business, as Ursula pointed out. But we are now seeing megadeals in the pipeline. Last year was -- it was a little bit of an anomaly, and they're starting to materialize. So we expect that we'll see strong bookings growth next year, where we expect to see that in the -- where we -- we return to plus 10% kind of bookings growth. So we're optimistic about that, and some of that will be driven because we'll have more megadeals.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then Ursula, if you could just talk a little bit on the Technology side. I'm curious as to what you're sort of thinking about for 2013 in terms of competition, and especially when you factor in what's going on with the yen. Do you anticipate more competitive environment? I know several of the competitors have launches coming. You guys have a launch coming. Just if you could give any color on sort of how you think the world shapes up especially given the yen depreciation?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. I think our position for 2013 is very strong. We spent 2012 in a very methodical way, assuring that we positioned ourselves for what we saw were growth areas in this business: color, SMB, developing economies, et cetera. So we managed our cost base. We were very conservative about how we went after deals, given that our product portfolio wasn't refreshed. We positioned ourselves for 2013 refresh, which will come next month. And so I'm actually feeling pretty good about our ability to meet our expectations, improving activity levels, stabilizing of revenue from an equipment sales perspective and total perspective, and I think that we're positioned well against the competition. But our offering that we'll offer, that we'll launch next month are not just about products. They're also about the software and services surrounding the products, positioning us well to expand our Document Outsourcing business as well. So I think that it will be a reasonable year, and we're positioned well against the competition. As far as the yen goes, the good news about the yen is that it gives us a little bit of tailwind, but it also gives our competitors tailwind. So we're going to have to pay attention in the marketplace. We have to price to win where it's smart for us to go after it. We have a big focus on profitability. We have -- most of the yen benefit for us because we hedge, comes in the latter half of the year. But we'll keep an eye on the marketplace and make sure that we are aggressive and win where it's good for us to win.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Bachman of Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Ursula, I wanted to ask you about leadership, and I'll frame it in 2 different ways. One, how are you thinking about filling the very big shoes of Luca, in particular the background that you're looking for? And I'm not necessarily looking for internal versus external but skill sets, particularly as you think about the benchmark of growth is Services. And then two, where do you think the leadership -- do you think you need more depth in Services given relative inconsistency in performance since the addition of ACS?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thank you, Keith. So first on the CFO replacement. You are correct that the next CFO has some pretty big shoes to fill. Interestingly enough, Luca had some big shoes to fill as well. And I am very, very confident that we will find a more than adequate replacement for Luca, very confident. The search has already started. I am, in some ways, overwhelmed with the number of candidates that I have to look through. So I think that we'll end up in a good place, in a very good pace with the CFO. What I'm looking for is someone who has global experience, someone who's strong, fairly aggressive in their approach. We have a strategy. It is not going to change because Luca left. So I want somebody who can actually implement the strategy that we have in place, and then think on a go-forward basis  of some of the new things that we have to do.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And I guess just to tease it out for a second or so, would you tilt towards somebody with services experience, given the importance over the next 3 years of Services to Xerox?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. As we look forward, we're looking for Luca, we wanted someone who had some background in a global -- large global complex business, but also someone who had some services experience. So the answer is yes. But it won't be only a services play. We have a big business to run. It is all around the world, and I need someone who can actually play well and understand well all of those markets. I'm confident that we'll get somebody very, very good. As far as leadership in general, whenever we replace a leader, we -- I look for certain general tendencies. I need someone who is extremely flexible but strong, someone who actually can implement well. I need an operator in the business. And someone who is prepared for the way that the business is going on a go-forward basis. And that obviously means people who have more history or knowledge about services. So the answer to your general leadership question has nothing to do with inconsistency of performance, it has to do with future growth and how I see the business going on a go-forward basis. So I need people who have good services knowledge and background, and that's what I'll look for across the board when we hire.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, let me just sneak in a follow-up, and then I'll cede the floor. Just on bookings, Lynn mentioned that you thought Services bookings would be a positive number in calendar year '13 -- bookings growth, I should say. Is that confidence driven by the fact of the pipeline or the compares or just a little bit more on why you think the bookings will turn the corner here from a negative to the positive?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Let me start, and this is probably a question that will happen -- a lot of people probably have, so we'll spend a little bit more time on this one. It turns out that in 2011, we signed in our ITO business an amazing amount of business. If you look at the absolute number, we actually doubled a normal signing year in 2011. So the total TCV in '11 was about $3.5 billion and a normal year would be about $3 billion in ITO. This is in ITO. Obviously, the rest of the business is bigger. In 2012, we went back to a normal pace and a normal growth level. So what we're saying is that we are absolutely confident, very confident, based on the pipeline, based on the billings, based on everything that we will be able to grow over 2012 in ITO, and therefore, in the total Services business on a TCV basis. So I want us -- it's interesting when you look at this, this is not a point of weakness. We had a phenomenal year in one line of business and a very good year in the rest of the businesses in 2011. 2012 is back to a normal growth cycle for us. In 2013, we'll be back to that again. So yes, so that's the short of it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes of Barclays Capital.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about cash flow for next year. Your expectation for share repurchases goes down quite a bit. Is there any upside to that $400 million? And how are you looking at that? Is that something that -- it is dependent on who you -- who succeeds Luca? Is there -- are there any puts and takes on how you look at the flexibility of that number? And then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula M. Burns", "First of all, Luca will answer the rest, but it has nothing to do with who succeeds Luca. As I said earlier in answering the CFO question, we have a strategy, and the strategy has been embedded across the management team. We spent a lot of time on it, and so I am -- it is independent of the individual that sits in the chair. And Luca, why don't you...", "Luca Maestri", "With those who argue, it's a smart strategy, so I hope it doesn't change. And on the numbers, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion, it's the same number that we mentioned in November, Ben. It's a bit lower than this year because we're going to have some positives, it's -- the pension contributions are positives. And obviously, earnings are going to be a bit positive because your -- the EPS number is high. The effect of the finance receivables will -- they're not going to be the same level of contribution that we had in 2012 for obvious reasons. But -- so we were confident with the range, $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion. In terms of capital allocation, we talked in November about having some level of flexibility in the numbers to start the year, and that's why we said at least -- so much for repurchase, we said at least $400 million for repurchase, at least $400 million for debt. That level of flexibility had increased a bit because cash flow was so strong in Q4. So we come in with a bit more flexibility. And how much we're going to dial up repurchase will depend, frankly, on 2 factors: One, earnings as we go through the year, and if earnings are strong, there is an opportunity; and we always watch interest rates because they drive discount rate for the pension calculation, right? But yes, there is a bit of flexibility and it's increased a bit with Q4.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Then just my follow-up, as another way of asking the Services question. With trailing 12-month bookings down 26%, you've said that you can still grow and hit your targets for revenue growth for 2013. Another company we cover, IBM, had bookings down 2%, and they're looking for services growth next year of flat, and that obviously makes intuitive sense to us just given where bookings were the year before. It's a much different business. But when we hear bookings down 26% and then hear revenues are going to be 7% or so growth, begs the question, just can you give us a little bit more math? Is there -- for example, IBM again, they kind of give you the 70% of their base contracts that they know they have, and the revenue growth off of that, and then that kind of thing. Can you just give us a little more support so that we can go from down 25% to plus 7%. Is it duration? And do you actually have that 70% visibility, and then you know the duration, et cetera? So that we know you can do it based on the bookings trends.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. Absolutely, Ben. The things that enter into the math are the bookings number, as you pointed out. And as Ursula said, this year was much more the kind of a normal year, especially in the ITO business. So we have a threshold that we -- that we use to calculate the -- sort of our minimum in order to hit the growth targets that we have, and we met that number. The second piece that factors into the growth is the renewal rate. And our renewals for the year were 85%, which is 5% higher than they were in 2011. If you take the positive impact of the higher renewal rate, it offsets pretty close the lower bookings. Does that make sense? They both contribute. And we also have a higher recurring revenue rate than I think what you were talking about. Most of -- ours is about 85%, so that helps us in terms of sort of the predictability of the revenue stream.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Can I just sneak in one more? And I'm done. On supplies, what trends are you seeing there for channel inventory and the trends into '13?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So we have -- '12 was, I think, a fairly typical year. When we talk about supplies, Ben, we talk about unbundled supplies. It's a small percentage of our total revenue. It's less than $2 billion a year. We've seen a development on supplies, which is very, very consistent with annuity revenue in general in 2013 -- in 2012, so '12 was down about 3%. We expect for 2013 something in the mid-single-digit decline for supply, in line with the overall Technology business. So again, also on supplies, we do not have unreasonable expectations as we enter the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of JPMorgan.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to kind of follow on, on the previous question line of thought around just the signings velocity. Was 2011 really just kind of the big peak, if you will, or everything come together in terms of ACS, Xerox synergies, and that's as good as it gets? Just trying to understand why we've never really seen the follow-through in terms of the potential cross-pollination.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. 2011 was a good year, but you are seeing the follow-through. First of all, 2011 in one line of business, in the ITO line of business was an exceptional year. We are seeing growth, and we'll continue to see growth in 2013 in BPO as well, and Document Outsourcing is doing its normal thing. So this is not the end of the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's kind of hard to downplay our 2011, which was good. But this is -- we continue to sign. We continue to sell. We continue to cross-pollinate. We continue to get new business. We had 7% more deals signed in 2012 than we did in 2011. Contract length was a little bit shorter, and there were fewer megadeals. But our signings velocity continues, and we have 7% more revenue in -- so the business is -- this is not the end of the line by any stretch of the imagination. It's performing fairly well. The math that Lynn just brought you through, which is a math of renewals, a math of signings, we have a strong pipeline that continues to just keep it -- it's up 6%, shows and should give some confidence that the revenue numbers that we have -- we take into account price declines, everything, the revenue numbers that we have for 2013, which is mid- to high-single-digit revenue growth for our Services business is pretty solid.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "If I can just add also. The number -- bear in mind, too, that the number that we give is the annual recurring revenue number. And many times, I think people get confused with the TCV. But this is an annual recurring revenue number, and so it's very predictable. The math is easy to calculate, and we feel comfortable.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "As a follow-up, if I could, when I hear about shorter-term contracts, it does start to beg the question, are we going to see a heightened level of pricing pressures down the road. If the contracts are shorter and they're going to be coming up for renewal faster, maybe there's more and more vendors fighting for less and less business. I mean, how should we think about that pricing slope over time? Is it going to start to get more severe?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I actually -- I'll take it. The contract length on average has gone from 5 years to 3 years, first of all. Shorter is not a year. Shorter is 3 years. Absolutely, you will see at the end of 3 years people competing for the contracts and they would have normally have competed at the end of 5 years. And price, as Lynn said, is something that is clearly a part of the negotiation when you come up for renewal. So the answer is -- will we see pressure at 3 years? The answer is yes. One of the questions and drives that we have, one of the things I push Lynn for is we interact with clients in a way that penetrates the account and then expands our position in the account. We intend to continue to do that. It's proven successful for us in the past, and it will prove successful, I think, in the future. The shorter contract and less megadeals is a sign of the times today. We had significant pressure in both government and large enterprises, given a very weak macroeconomic environment. That is what I, Xerox Corporation and all our vendors are going to deal with. We'll deal in the marketplace to be very aggressive and continue to win, I think, like we win now.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "[indiscernible] Just this one I'd just cover. The other thing is that many of the lines of business, customer care, for example, a 3-year contract life is the normal contract life. And if we don't sign as many ITO deals, which are longer typically and megadeals which are longer, that doesn't mean that the entire portfolio is shrinking in contract length. The other factor is that the discounts that we are required to give at the -- at renewal time tend to be driven by an average annual discount rate. So if we have a 5-year contract, you can take what that annual discount rate is times 5. If it's a 3-year contract, you times it by 3. So the net overall discount is not significantly different, and we have a large part of our portfolio, you're seeing it, is a 3-year deal. It's what -- and we'll build around that. So I wouldn't say that just because we don't have as many 5-year ITO deals or megadeals that the discounting pressure is going to be significantly different.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, appreciate that. If I could -- real quickly just shifting gears, Ursula, I have to say as an observer, you really sound pumped up today in your cadence. Everything sounds very positive, but yet your guidance isn't changing for 2013. Is that just measured conservatism just because it's early in the year, and you want to see how these new products roll out next month? I do -- you sound a lot more confident and upbeat versus the prior few calls.", "Ursula M. Burns", "I am upbeat, I'm hoping, in every call. I'm happy I sound better today than I did in the past. I am very confident in the guidance that we have. I -- we've studied the business a lot. We're kind of on a cadence now that is a good rhythm. And so yes, I'm confident in what we've laid out for 2013. This is not going to be a walk in the park. The environment hasn't changed that dramatically to make it that much better around the world. But I think that we know how to operate it, and I think I know we know how to operate it. So yes, I'm confident.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. So you guys obviously had a nice recovery here in the Services margin, and I think you laid out the drivers there pretty clearly. Could you just help us understand how we should think about the quarterly swing factors here throughout the year, and basically how we should think about the overall drivers of the seasonality from a margin perspective within this range you've provided for the year?", "Luca Maestri", "Yes. So Bill, we said margin range, 10% to 12% for Services. Clearly, you know that from a seasonality perspective, Q1 and Q3 are lower than Q2 and Q4, particularly in Document Outsourcing where we got more fixed costs attached to the business. For -- and we've launched a number of restructuring actions. They will progress and provide more and more benefit as we go through the year, so you should be thinking of about it in terms of Services margins growing sequentially from Q1 forward. And clearly, Q1 lower than the Q4 that we just had just because of seasonality and -- but we expect already for Q1 improvement year-over-year. I think that should give you enough.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then you mentioned hitting the -- your targeted renewal rate range for the year. Can you talk about the renewal rate dynamics exiting the year, again sort of the unusual seasonal aspects to consider there? And then how you're thinking about your renewal rate management plans going into next year, given, obviously, we don't want to see too many surprises there.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. The renewal rates are -- they're pretty sensitive, and the sensitivity is driven by the timing of particular renewals, and here's why. When we calculate the renewal rate, we look at the total universe to be renewed, and then take what percentage of that was renewed. If you have a large contract that you expect to renew that happens to slip from one quarter to the next quarter, that lowers the overall number, and therefore, a loss, has a different and dramatic impact. Hopefully, that makes sense. Yes. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a couple of deals that we had expected to renew that slipped into the -- we believe that will happen in the first quarter. We're very, very focused on -- we know what those renewals are. We're very, very focused on winning those renewals, and that's why we're not overly concerned about. We're confident that our renewal rate for 2013 will be in the range. And -- but we can't call with absolute precision what happens from quarter-to-quarter because the timing of -- an individual customer, we can really believe that we're going to get them signed, and they can shift one week and that can make a big difference in the renewal rate. So that's why we're not overly concerned about it. We don't see a drastic fall off in renewals. Most of this is timing.", "Luca Maestri", "What we -- I mean, what we really like is the fact that for the year, we were 5 points up in renewal, and that is very, very important for revenue growth going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A quick question is in your prepared comments, you mentioned about 2013 a much more healthier year for signings and things. Can you help us better understand about -- are these -- that you're already talking with companies, and they're just really putting off the formal proposal and just has  yet to happen? Or is it any type of real cement or granularity behind that as opposed to just hoping for a bigger market? And indeed, there's some slip from Q4 into Q1, or just kind of help us understand those dynamics.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Right. So it's a little bit of all that you said, which I know you really don't like that answer, but it is true. Some of these -- some of the signings are things that we know. We're already engaged with clients and we're working through the details of the engagement. We don't -- until we get them, I can't count them. And I don't actually feel comfortable until we actually get the signing. But yes, some of it is that. Some of it is we have some lines of business, state, transportation that has -- and customer care, that have good offers out and are engaging clients. Some of it is yet to come. And our pipeline grew in 2012 by 6%, so we had -- so we have more in the hopper, more engagements in the hopper. It's kind of a normal year. 2013 we're viewing as a normal year. Growth across the portfolios, nothing too unusual, leveraging the synergies of having our 2 companies together, and therefore, growing in a fairly normal range. Nothing too exciting or too special, but still good, but very good.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "I think the one shift that we've seen that's different, that was the same in '11, different in '12 is the appearance of more megadeals, as we said, and we have more of those in the pipeline now than we did halfway through 2012, for example.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Was there any slipping from Q4 to Q1?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Were there any -- excuse me?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Slipping.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Slipping of deals?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Oh, for sure, for sure. Lynn talked about it a little bit. There were a couple of deals that we thought we would be able to ink in Q4. These are generally renewals. These are -- well, not general, they are generally renewals, and we -- they slipped into Q1 or whenever the customer decides to sign it. Oftentimes, that's actually not bad news for us. If you can keep the client with the same terms and conditions, because as you know when you renew, you usually lower cost a little bit -- price a little bit. It's not a bad thing to actually have it moved, but we would prefer to have them signed, but we have to wait for the customer. We can't force them. They're -- sometimes they're less comfortable or want to delay. Nothing unusual, though.", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "And I think on the bookings on the new business side, we do have deals that slip. They always slip. And then the next quarter, some slip from the next quarter. So I'm waiting for the day when everything that's slipped from the previous quarter gets closed in this quarter and we have no slips to the next quarter. But yes, we had a couple of deals, and things were a little lighter than we expected because of that. But nothing that was grossly out of order.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Chris Whitmore of Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to approach the bookings, maybe from a little bit of a different angle, and specifically wanted to ask about BPO bookings. If I look at the trend line in BPO bookings over the past couple of years, it's been down 2 years in a row from fiscal year '10, $10 billion to $6 billion in fiscal year '12, understanding that ITO was strong, et cetera, and contract durations are changing. But nonetheless, I'm trying to understand what are the implications for the mix in your revenue as you roll forward into fiscal '13 between BPO, ITO and Document Outsourcing. Do you expect a significant change in mix or rates of growth between the segments? And does that have implications on margins?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. I think that right now, we're expecting that ITO -- because of the strong bookings from 2011, ITO is going to continue to grow, and its growth rate will be a few points higher than the BPO rate. But BPO is a much larger business than the ITO business. So don't -- just don't do direct math to say that's going to -- that's going to necessarily drastically changed the overall growth rate. But BPO is, if you think about it in the last year, governments have been under extreme pressure. I mean, it's been as tough a time for states and local entities as I can certainly remember. And so some deals and BPO government deals are almost -- not always, but 80% of them are BPO, there's been a lot of pressure. And we're seeing, as Ursula mentioned, some lightening of that pressure, right? We're not ready to say that it's drastically changed, but we're starting to see a little bit of lightening there. So we're hopeful that, that will help to spur BPO booking. I think most of the downward pressure that you've seen over the last couple of years has really been driven through our -- through the various aspects of the government business, and we're seeing some improvement there.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Does that changing mix impact the profitability? In other words, are ITO margins vastly different than BPO?", "Luca Maestri", "ITO margins are slightly lower than average. We talked about it in the past. But really, it's not a massive shift. Keep in mind that revenue growth, which then drives margins, right, was significantly higher in BPO in 2012 than the other lines. And so I don't see much of a mix impact from the increased growth in ITO. It's extremely manageable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.", "Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I just have a question, really, on the direction of Services margins and more about the cost cutting that you guys are doing. In the event that let's say this is a more secular drive towards smaller deal sizes, do you have to do more restructuring to hit your margin targets? Don't you see it that way? And could you remind us of what further cost downs we might see in that business segment as we go through 2013?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "Yes. The restructuring efforts, as we said at the beginning, are -- we made some good progress in the fourth quarter. We're just -- we're not through by any stretch, and we will continue to do things that we think are prudent and as aggressive as we think are prudent over 2013. The other side of the coin relative to the deal size is that typically smaller deals have slightly larger -- or slightly higher margins. So even though the deal size may be coming down, that is not a downward pressure on margins. That's actually -- that actually helps lift them a little bit.", "Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Just on that point though, like how much more in terms of dollar cost would you say year-over-year you've got to yet reduce in '13? Could you give us a number around that?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "I think what we would like to do is an amount similar to the amount that we did in the fourth quarter.", "Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And the just a question for -- on acquisitions. On the $500 million that you might spend, is that a very firm number? Or is there a chance, for example, you get the end of this year and you spend $100 million, the rest can be put into buyback for shareholders? Or how should we think about how firm that number is?", "Luca Maestri", "Can you repeat the question? What number are you referring to?", "Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I'm referring to the amount that you might spend on acquisitions this year, how firm $400 million $500 million is, and whether you could actually use that for further distribution to shareholders.", "Luca Maestri", "I think you need to step back for a second and think about our strategy. And really acquisition, we always said, is an important part of our strategy, and part of the growth that we're going to be experiencing in Services will be driven by acquisitions. We said up to $500 million. It really will depend on the type of companies that we -- that are available. And so I would say the flexibility that we have, it's more around the fact that we've got good cash generation from Q4, some level of flexibility. And if earnings progress the way we expect them to progress, there will be an opportunity to do both, to do more repurchase and to stick to our acquisition number.", "Operator", "Our final question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Two, if I could. Luca, just a clarification, did I hear correctly that you said selling of receivables would contribute $500 million less in '13 than it did in '12? And if I did hear that correctly, is that a gross number or a net number?", "Luca Maestri", "It's a -- I mean, it's a gross number, I would say, because it's essentially a number, the combination of the fact that we do not expect the portfolio to run off as much as it did in 2012. We believe that equipment activity is going to be stronger in 2013, new products and so on. And the fact that, of course, we have accelerated the collection of certain receivables from '13 in 2012, right? So it is the amount of lower contribution that we expect from finance receivables in 2013.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. Is that -- so is that -- is the comparable number to that in '12 the $625 million or the $502 million or the...", "Luca Maestri", "The comparable number is $947 million. It's the amount of cash that we generated in finance receivables during 2012, which was $947 million.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "I got you. That was helpful. And then just a follow-up is, Ursula, did I hear you correctly that you expect equipment sales to be up or to grow in 2013?", "Ursula M. Burns", "No, it won't grow. I said that we expect total revenues to be, in the Technology business, to be down in the mid single digits. We expect some softening of the decline that we saw in 2012. We saw double-digit decline in 2012. I expect that we'll see -- continue to see declines but it will just be moderated a bit as we launch new products.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. I was asking just specifically about equipment sales, not...", "Ursula M. Burns", "That's specifically about equipment sales. And the total revenue is about the same, anyway. I mean, the answer can go for total revenue or equipment sales.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. And just last one on the equipment sales. Any margin implications from the new product launches, positive or negative due to mix of pricing?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Not really. It turns out that equipment sales are less profitable than post sales. That's the way that the business model works. But over time, throughout the -- as this matures, as we sell and it matures, I don't think there'll be any margin implications. Margin implications will come from the fact that we actually are restructuring, and we'll continue to do that to drive cost and stay competitive.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks. That's all the time we have for questions today, and I certainly appreciate your interest. And Ursula, I'd like to turn it over to you to wrap up, please.", "Ursula M. Burns", "We covered quite a bit of ground today, and I'd like to spend just a second in kind of raising it up a little -- a couple of levels. Here are the reasons to keep your eye on our company: Services-led growth, possible leadership through Document Technology, cash-generating annuity-based business model, consistent earnings expansion and financial strength to invest and building value for Xerox and building value for you. And that's our focus, and I'm really confident that we'll continue to deliver.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula, and that concludes our call today.", "Operator", "Thank you.

She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor.", "At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. Before we review the third quarter, I'd like to take a moment to remind everyone that earlier this week marked the 75th anniversary of the invention of xerography. Back then, the vision was to make work simpler by automating the copying process. Since then, simplifying the way work gets done has influenced the development of our products and more recently, the expansion of our Business Process services.", "We've remained true to that purpose. And today, we ensure that our strategy is linked to that original vision. It's key for moving Xerox into the next 75 years.", "So let's review the strategy. The first plank is to shift our business more to services, while enhancing our services offerings and improving our profitability.", "Services revenue now represents 56% of our total revenue, up from 51% in 2012, so we've passed the tipping point on revenue but still have work to do on margin. To this end, we continue to focus on improving our cost structure, while maintaining investments in particular areas where we see opportunities, such as health care.", "Secondly, we are focused on maintaining our leadership in Document Technology and effectively managing this profitable business with strong cash characteristics. The past 2 quarters, we've shown good progress. This quarter, we saw revenue decline stabilize and very good profitability and continue our market share leadership with #1 equipment share revenue.", "Delivering on these strategies will enable us to deliver consistent earnings expansion and strong cash flow, which we are committed to deploy in a balanced way that will enhance shareholder value. During Q3, we successfully delivered on our objectives. And although we still have work to do, I believe that we are moving in the right direction.", "So here's a closer look at our Q3 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.26, GAAP EPS of $0.22, which includes $0.04 related to the amortization of intangibles. Total revenue was flat year-over-year, down 1% in constant currency.", "We continue to see growth in Services, which was up 3% in this quarter, although it is flattening a bit as we lap a ramp of large ITO contracts and inorganic contributions. Services operating margin was 9.9%. And although an improvement year-over-year, it's an area where we need to make more structural progress.", "Our renewal rate in BPO and ITO is at the high end of our range, with continued positive pipeline growth and solid new business signings, which positions us well for the future.", "In Document Technology, revenue stabilized with positive results in Global Imaging and the high-end business, offsetting weakness in developing markets and Europe.", "Segment margins were above the high end of our range, reflecting both continued cost and expense management, as well as the onetime benefit from our finance receivables sale. In total, margin was a solid 9.4% and up 50 basis points year-over-year. Good progress, but we have more work to do, and we have several initiatives underway that will deliver, over time, margin improvement.", "Cash from operations was very strong this quarter, and we're on track to deliver at the higher end of the full year operating cash flow range and to exceed our threshold share repurchase targets. So all up, all in, we had good results in Q3.", "As we look to Q4, we face greater challenges, where our revenue and operating profits will face some headwinds, so we remain well positioned in our markets and confident in our ability to expand earnings over time.", "With that, let me turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open this call to your questions.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we had a solid quarter. One key highlight this quarter was that we saw operating profit growth from both our Services and Technology segments. We also continued to see positive trends in leading indicators and strong cash flow.", "Let's start with a look at overall earnings. Revenue was flat year-over-year but down 1% at constant currency, with Services growth of 3% and Document Technology decline of 4% or 5% at constant currency. We experienced a slowing in Services growth, which was expected and stabilization in Document Technology decline.", "Gross margin of 31.5% was flat year-over-year despite the fact that the relative growth of our Services segment naturally pressures gross margin. RD&E and SAG were both lower year-over-year, benefiting from our ongoing productivity initiatives, as well as the greater mix of Services.", "Operating margin was 9.4%. Flat gross margin and expense line performance resulted in a 50 basis point margin expansion year-over-year, driving operating profit growth of 5%.", "There were specific dynamics in Services and Document Technology that contributed to this positive performance. I'll cover that in more detail when I get to the individual segment slides.", "Adjusted other net of $79 million was flat year-over-year, with the benefits of a building sale offsetting higher restructuring in the quarter. And equity income of $43 million was a modest contributor year-over-year, reflecting continued solid performance trends in Fuji Xerox.", "Our adjusted tax rate came in at 28%, about 4 percentage points higher year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.26 was up $0.01 from 2012 and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. Clearly, this is 1 blueprint for the type of operating results we want to see going forward over the long term, recognizing that we have to overcome some near-term headwinds to consistently get there.", "As we move into the segment performance slides, I'll run through the drivers of the third quarter results, as well as what we're expecting in Q4.", "Turning first to Services. Services revenue growth was 3% overall, with BPO up 1%, Document Outsourcing up 5% and ITO up 8%. Growth rates are playing out as expected, with Document Outsourcing showing stable mid-single-digit growth, ITO growth beginning to taper and BPO growth being somewhat pressured as we begin to lose organic contributions and continue to absorb the headwind from the runoff of the student loan business.", "Looking to Q4, we expect these dynamics to continue, with Services growth closer to flat as we hit our most challenging compare on student loans, ITO growth further decelerates and we lose inorganic revenue contribution. Additionally, we anticipate some increased volume pressure in wireless customer care.", "As we look to 2014, we expect growth will begin to pick up again, driven by favorable signings and renewals, a strong new business pipeline and a richer and more mature pool of acquisition prospects.", "Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.9% in the third quarter, up 50 basis points year-over-year, driven by margin gains in Document Outsourcing, an easier compare given the prior year government contract write-offs in BPO, and savings from cost actions. Partially offsetting these positives were margin pressure from a less rich mix, as we've grown ITO and absorb the impact of the student loan runoff.", "We've also seen increased expenses associated with the rollout of our new Medicaid platform and health care exchange operation. We're very pleased with the successful implementations of these platforms with Alaska's Medicaid Management Information System and Nevada's health insurance exchange both launched successfully this past quarter.", "As with many large new programs, there's an initial period of higher costs during rollout, including noncash amortization of the platforms. We continue to be excited about these long-term health care-related opportunities and expect to gain scale and experience efficiencies over time.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect margin pressures to continue, with the year-over-year student loan compare being the most challenging of the year, resulting in about a $20 million decline in operating profit from that business unit. As a result, we expect Services margins will decline from the relatively strong 11.2% from the fourth quarter 2012 to about 10%, with full year Services margins a bit lower than 10%.", "So while we're seeing positive trends in key performance indicators, we're in a transition period where we're pressured by line of business mix and investments. At our November investor conference, we'll walk through in detail the Services business' dynamics and actions that we're taking to drive sustainable margin improvement.", "I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 4% or 5% at constant currency this quarter, which was in line with the second quarter as the trajectory of the business stabilized. Equipment sale revenue year-over-year was up 1% for the total company and down 3% within Document Technology, reflecting continued good success from our recently launched products in mid-range and high-end.", "Within mid-range, we continue to see good activity across the ConnectKey platform. High-end also experienced good growth in both entry and production color, and we continue to feel good about the improving trends and our position in this segment.", "Finally in entry, once again, color A4 MFPs had good growth. But in total, entry continues to be down, driven by weaker results in developing markets. Overall, Document Technology margin was very strong at 12.1%, up 130 basis points year-over-year and above our target range of 9% to 11%.", "On an absolute basis, this quarter's finance receivables sale resulted in a $25 million gain, boosting margin by about 100 basis points. However, the benefit year-over-year was negligible, as we had a similar gain in the prior year period. Contributing to the year-over-year improvement were cost and efficiency savings and a modest currency benefit from the weak yen.", "Looking towards the fourth quarter, we expect Document Technology revenue growth down mid-single digits, generally consistent with the third quarter performance but with a bit more pressure in developing markets. In terms of margins, we expect they will be down versus the very strong 12.3% from the fourth quarter of 2012 but at the higher end of our 9% to 11% target range.", "This incorporates lower finance receivable gains, as well as higher pension settlement activity and associated costs, as retirees seek to cash in their benefit before a higher discount rate goes into effect next year. So overall, good performance in Document Technology.", "With that, I'd like to turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong, with $960 million in the third quarter and $1.4 billion year-to-date through September. Free cash flow was similarly strong at $860 million in the third quarter and $1.1 billion through the first 3 quarters.", "While there are some timing differences coming into play year-over-year, one of the drivers of our improved performance is better contribution to cash flows from Services, which reflects improvements in working capital.", "Looking specifically at the third quarter, the improvements in operating cash flow year-over-year was driven primarily by accounts receivable, which was a source of about $85 million this quarter versus a use of $319 million last year. The drivers of this improved contribution were improved DSO and a higher level of factoring versus prior year.", "Finance receivables, although not much of a swing factor year-over-year, probably deserves further explanation. It was a source of a little more than $400 million this past quarter and in the third quarter of 2012, with both periods benefiting from a finance receivables sale.", "Looking to the fourth quarter, we're planning another finance receivables sale, but it will be approximately $150 million or so less than the one that we did in the fourth quarter of 2012. Considering the smaller-sized sale and the lower collections due to past sales, we anticipate finance receivables will likely be a modest source of cash in the fourth quarter, which compares to a $260 million worth of cash in the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Overall, we expect the fourth quarter operating cash flow to be close to $1 billion, which is lower than our traditional seasonality, due to the expected lower contribution from finance receivables, as well as working capital timing, which has been more smoothed out this year. Given the strong cash flow through September, we expect to end the year towards the higher end of our $2.1 billion to $2.4 billion range.", "Moving down the cash flow report. Investing cash flows were an $82 million use in the quarter. We spent $102 million on CapEx; had proceeds of $41 million from asset sales, primarily the sale of our Dallas facility; and we spent $24 million on acquisitions.", "Cash from financing was a use of $870 million and included the retirement of our $600 million senior note in September. Also included was $77 million of common dividends and $162 million that were spent in share repurchases.", "Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan. We ended the quarter with $7.5 billion in debt, which is $600 million lower than the June ending balance, driven by the senior note repayment, a portion of which we intend on refinancing. Applying the 7:1 leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.5 billion, leaving core debt of $3 billion.", "Our financing debt continues to decline, driven by finance receivables sales and lower originations. Our strong year-to-date cash flow and expectation to be toward the higher end of our free cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion to $1.9 billion provides more flexibility with our capital allocation plan.", "On share repurchase, given the positive cash flow trends, we expect that repurchases will be at least a couple of hundred million dollars above our $400 million minimum guidance.", "On acquisitions, year-to-date, we've spent about $160 million relative to our full year guidance of between $300 million to $500 million. The slower pace of Services acquisitions has put a damper on Services revenue growth. But as I mentioned earlier, I continue to feel good about the quality and progression of the deals that are in our pipeline.", "And finally, dividends will use about $300 million of cash, which factors in our Q1 dividend increase to $0.0575 per share a quarter.", "So in summary, a good quarter. Document Technology has stabilized despite some weakening in developing markets but will face a difficult margin compare in Q4. Services continues to face headwinds that will knock down growth and margin in Q4 but the underlying metrics remain positive, and we continue to work hard at improving our cost structure.", "As a result, we expect that fourth quarter total company revenue will be down a couple of percentage points year-over-year and operating margin will be lower than our prior year 10.6%, yielding an expected earnings per share of $0.28 to $0.30 for the quarter, bringing our full year EPS guidance to the low end of the range.", "Our guidance includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring, as well as $0.02 negative impact from the higher noncash pension settlements that I highlighted earlier. Cash flow has been very strong, and we're on track to meet our capital allocation objectives, with an opportunity to do more in share repurchases.", "And with that, I'll turn it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "So thanks, Kathy, and here's a quick wrap-up. Overall, the fundamentals of our business are strong. In Q3, we overcame headwinds in Services to deliver Services profit growth. We saw a stabilization in Document Technology, margins in line with expectations and strong cash flow.", "That said, Q4 will be a more challenging quarter. We'll face more difficult compares and continue to absorb health care sector investments, while not fully realizing the benefits of our longer-term margin initiatives. For our fourth quarter, we expect, as Kathy said, adjusted EPS of $0.28 to $0.30. This includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring and $0.02 from higher pension settlement expenses.", "And we are narrowing our full year adjusted EPS to $1.08 to $1.10.", "Throughout 2013, we've navigated the headwinds of negative Services mix, a slowdown in developing markets and continued weakness in Europe, while continuing to make investments in areas of opportunities such as health care. We have delivered at the high end of our range over the last 3 quarters and with strong cash flow.", "In spite of this, Q4 is anticipated to be a weaker quarter but I'm confident that we are taking the actions to position us better for the future. And we look forward to sharing them with you at our Investor Conference on November 12.", "Before we open it up to questions, let me turn it over to Jim Lesko, who's the Head of Investor Relations.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Lynn Blodgett, Head of Xerox Services business. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial details to today's -- to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.", "[Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "I had a question on the Services business. Specifically looking at the operating margin, which obviously is below 10%, with only about 1% of growth in BPO. Can you talk more about what you're doing specifically from a restructuring standpoint, what kind of changes you're making, perhaps in how you're selling or where you're selling, balancing the mix? Just how are you going to -- how you're working on improving that. And then I have a follow-up.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Sure. So a couple of different things. First, I'll speak to restructuring in the quarter. We had about $0.02 of restructuring costs, Shannon. About 40% of the restructuring costs were for the Services segment. I'd say the biggest piece of restructuring that we're doing within Services is continuing to move our mix, right-shoring more offshore. And we've talked about that previously. I'd say we're making progress there but certainly looking to accelerate that progress, which will continue to have some level of restructuring costs associated with it. In terms of the overall mix of the business, part of what we've talked about is we've had negative mix kind of headwinds recently. We've obviously seen, over the past several quarters, the fact that ITO has tended to grow at a faster pace than BPO, and ITO has a lower margin overall than BPO. And so that's been giving us a negative mix. More recently, the additional negative mix that we're seeing is just the runoff of the student loan business. So from a top line perspective, as I look out to the fourth quarter, that pressures top line by about 1.5 percentage point. And from a margin perspective, that's worth 60 to 70 basis point pressure in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that's some of the mix elements that we're seeing that are causing pressure. But as I look out forward beyond that, I continue to point to just overall strong signings, really strong renewals, strong new business pipelines. So year-to-date, Services -- our signings are up 30%. And within BPO year-to-date, signings are up 40%. And new business only within BPO on a year-to-date basis is up 8%. So I think we've got really strong fundamental trends. So as we look towards 2014, I'd expect to see, overall, our growth rate pick up and our mix start to improve, as we'll begin to lap things like the student loan runoff.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay. And then just again on Services, perhaps I don't know if, Kathy or Ursula, you want to talk about or whoever wants to talk about it, the health care opportunity, with $2 billion of revenue from health care services and the ACA starting in January. Can you help to provide some color as to how we should think about benefit from this in terms of both the revenue? And then obviously, this quarter, we were hit by the startup in Nevada in that. So how do we sort of balance thinking about benefits from the ACA as we look at 2014?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So within BPO, health care is our fastest-growing area, and we're clearly benefiting from our #1 position in MMIS. So on the Medicare side, we're very strong. We were incredibly pleased that we've been actually standing up the new MMIS systems successfully. I think if you look in the newspapers recently, if there's one thing that's clear, standing up these systems is not particularly easy. And so while it's certainly come with a little bit higher cost that's pressuring margins, we continue to look at our overall position in health care and feel very good about the fact that we're participating across a number of different sectors. We obviously have a very strong position in MMIS in state and local government. We clearly have a strong payer position on the private side, as well as within our support that we provide to hospitals. So we continue to look at the changes that are occurring in health care generally, in part driven by the Affordable Care Act, and view it as just a really great opportunity. And the really nice thing about platforms is while -- when you're putting a new one in place, you clearly go through some of the pain of standing it up for the first time. This becomes a pretty replicable process for us. And so we certainly think, over time, we're going to get scale and experience gains in that area. So we're really excited about these opportunities. And while I mentioned Nevada specifically as a health care insurance exchange that we helped to stand up, we're also behind the scenes, participating in at least a handful of others and we're gaining more experience. And so as more states look to put these in place, we view that as an area of incremental growth going forward. So we continue to be really bullish about this.", "Ursula M. Burns", "I was going to add something, but there's nothing else to add. Kathy said it all.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I want to talk about cash flow. You guys mentioned several times in the pre [ph] that cash flow was really strong. And I just wanted to challenge that a bit. I mean, without factoring in selling finance receivables, it looks to my math that cash flow is going to be much closer to $1 billion this year than something at $2.4 billion. I mean, I cover a lot of other companies. We never include factoring in their cash flow and we exclude factoring from finance receivables, and then you factor in the accounts receivable line. And that's not very well understood. And it would seem to me that once we get done with this factoring, then cash flow normalizes in like a $1 billion range, and that's below EPS. And it says something about the earnings quality as well. And I mean, how am I wrong on this? I don't count factoring. I mean, that's like a onetime gain, and it's flowing to the P&L as well. I just -- I don't really agree with this, and I want you to deconstruct it and explain how real cash flow is not really just $1 billion.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So I'm very happy to talk about this. So with respect to factoring, all the company factors in the very near-term receivables, and it's been a practice that the company has been doing for a very long period of time. So it really has absolutely no impact on the company's core operating cash flow performance. So all we're factoring is near term, call it, within the next 60 days. It's a very efficient program that we have, and so the costs associated with doing that are de minimis. We view it as a very economic...", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. The finance receivables, $850 million this year, and you just can't do that forever. I mean, you take out the $850 million from the $2.4 billion, and my math is still pretty close.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. Can you kind of give me a second to walk through my explanation because I'm going to go back to start with? I think your math is completely wrong. So with respect to factoring, again, it causes absolutely no plus or minus to operating cash flow. All we're factoring is the very near-term receivables, and we're doing it because it's a very efficient form of, I'll call it, near-term financing for us with de minimis cost. If you look at what's going on year-over-year, we have a much smoother pattern of working capital this year. And so we're seeing some year-over-year changes, and that's just because we've got a much smoother pattern. I'm then going to turn to just financing receivables sales. So we did last year finance receivables sales. We're going to do about the same amount this year. That's just a movement in terms of timing, right? And overall, this year relative to last year, it's actually going to be a modest headwind as opposed to a gain year-over-year. By doing those finance receivables sales, we actually kind of trigger a need to pay down debt because our finance receivables actually get a much higher leverage factor. And so it really isn't anything that ultimately changes our overall cash profile. And I guess, if I get down to sort of the nuts and bolts at least of what some of our investors, I think, are focused on, which is capital allocation and how much excess capital we have to deploy against things like share repurchases, as I look out to 2014, while we may have some year-over-year differences in terms of the level of finance receivables sales the company may do, I think we're going to have a very consistent and balanced approach in terms of overall capital allocation continuing to look to do a meaningful amount of share repurchases.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Well, I think that you might want to change that definition to cash flow x financing, so we can look at it apples-to-apples. And I don't think everybody understands it. I really don't because when you put it in above the line, it makes it seem like it's real cash flow. And it's just a very unique way of portraying it, and I would highly suggest that. And I appreciate the answer.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. And certainly, I think our disclosures on this have been very fulsome. And if you don't get the math right, I certainly encourage you to talk to our IR group after the call because I think...", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "No, I think I get the math right. I think I get the math right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Services signings this -- for the past 12 months was up about 9% but fell 7% in the quarter due to the timing of contracts eligible for renewal. How does the renewal pipeline look like going forward? Do you have more contracts coming up for renewal in the coming quarters that can help drive improved performance in Services bookings?", "Lynn R. Blodgett", "The renewal pipeline tends to be -- it will be a little bit lumpy just based on the exact timing of a particular contract, and then 3 or 4 years later when it comes up to renewal. But in general, the renewal rates pretty much average across the average contract life. And right now, we're somewhere between 3 and 4 years. And you're going to see a little bit of lumpiness from 1 quarter to the next. But overall, if you look at a year -- the cumulation of a year, it's going to be pretty consistent.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And as a follow-up, the upcoming fourth quarter does pose some particularly challenging revenue and margin comps and operating environment. Could you talk about how we should think about, from a Services perspective, revenue growth in 2014, factoring in the headwinds from the student loan processing business and your ramping businesses with the Affordable Care Act? And how we should think about margins going forward, if we can continue to expect a step-up in margins, acknowledging that 2013 will be somewhat a flat to slightly down with the Services margins?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about what we're seeing in the fourth quarter, and then I'd say, at a high-level expectations for 2014. But we're going to talk a lot more in detail at our investor conference for 2014. So if you just look at what we're expecting, we're seeing in the fourth quarter, clearly, the runoff of the student loan business is giving us a big headwind on revenue, with that basically worth about 1.5 points of headwind on revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Acquisitions have historically been kind of a 2% to 3% revenue growth driver for us. And so if I look at the fourth quarter in the prior year period, 2012, it was worth about 2 points of growth, and it's going to be worth about nothing in the fourth quarter of this year. And so that's a near-term headwind. But certainly as I look out to 2014, we would expect that we'd actually have more acquisitions, and therefore, more growth coming from that area. And on student loan, obviously, we're seeing the biggest impact in the fourth quarter. And so as we head into next year, that impact will be kind of early on a headwind for us. And then as we get towards the end of next year, we'll start to lap that. As you mentioned, in your first question, I mean, overall, we've continued to have really strong signings and renewal and new business. And so as I look out into 2014, the year may start a little bit slower, but we certainly expect that new business and acquisitions will help us to then pick up overall growth.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's helpful. And how would you think about the margin cadence playing out?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So in terms of the overall margin cadence, as I look forward, the impact year-over-year from the student loan business runoff actually abates a little bit next year in terms of margins. So this year, it's worth, on a full year basis, about 35 basis points of margin headwind. Next year, that's probably closer to 25 basis points of margin headwind. I think really importantly, while we're starting to see some positive pick-up in terms of offshoring, that obviously takes a little bit of planning and timing to implement, and we'd expect a lot more gains from that as we head into next year. So I think those are some of the gives and takes. And then in terms of overall mix, typically, acquisitions are margin accretive to us. We're obviously looking to acquire things that have significant synergies associated with them, and we tend to target businesses that would be margin accretive. And the ITO growth slowing, that also just will help us from an overall mix perspective on margins. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit on the puts and takes. And obviously, this is an area of a whole lot of focus on from our part, and I think we're going to see progress.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with BMO.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I wanted to just ask about Services, please. And if I think about your calendar year EPS guidance, the pension expense wasn't in there. So it looks to me like you're taking down guidance by about $0.02 or $0.01 to $0.02, and yet the printing side of the business outperformed. So it really seems like the variance was on the Services side. And so if I think about it, it raises the problem from investor's perspective of consistency of execution, which in my mind comes back to leadership. So I'm really trying to understand what changed to cause you to take your calendar year guidance lower. And specifically student loan was known. You've talked about that since the March quarter. So was it the magnitude of the student loan? What -- or was it the ramp down of BPO. Because as part of this whole, I think, disappointment in the Services side of the business -- in addition, the signings were relatively weak for the quarter. So if you could just really address what was the disappointment from 91 days ago when you gave guidance on the Services side of the business?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "So a couple of things I'd say just in terms of new pieces of information. So a, we had certainly expected that we were going to have more from acquisitions in the fourth quarter. And so while the pipeline looks rich, I think deals are maturing. We had hoped we'd be able to close things sooner than is occurring. And so that's, I'd say, a near-term headwind, but certainly one as we look out to 2014 that we don't expect is going to continue to occur. The other thing I mentioned is on the one hand, we, I think, did a terrific job in terms of standing up MMIS systems and the Nevada health insurance exchange. That has caused some near-term pressure. I mean, those things are not easy to stand up, and so we're making more investments there. Those are a couple of things. I also mentioned in my prepared remarks that we're seeing a little bit of volume decline on the telecom side. And so we had a major telecom customer that got acquired by another company. And as a result of that acquisition, they're taking a little different approach. We're seeing some volume decline. So those are specifically the things I'd say if I backed up 90 days that I didn't have completely in view. And I'd also say that as I look at all of those things and I look forward into 2014 and beyond, I view them as transitionary and temporary factors.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And Keith, as far as leadership goes, we have an experienced team. We bring in on a regular basis new executives into the fold that could help us to refine our implementation and refine our approach to the business, and we're doing that every month, every day. We have 2 new executives that are particularly promising. I won't say their names because then they'll believe they're promising as well. But -- so I think that we actually have -- I have a very, very good view on weaknesses and strengths of our Services leadership team. And where we have weaknesses, we try to augment it or -- and move forward. So I am actually confident in our Services leadership.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And then the last -- sorry, the one more thing I wanted to add is you mentioned kind of weak signings in the quarter. We already mentioned that on the renewals. We just had not many renewal opportunities in the quarter. And so renewals were light just because we didn't have many opportunities. But year-to-date, overall Services signings are up 30% and BPO signings are up 40%. So I think the underlying trajectory there is very positive.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. For my follow-up then, could you just talk a little bit about what investors should anticipate directionally or any kind of dimensions with Q4 signings? So if you have some idea how signings look for the year.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. We expect Q4 signings are going to be modestly positive year-over-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Digging into the Affordable Care Act a bit more, can you remind us of your exposure here across Xerox and help us quantify it a bit better? Because we obviously get a lot of questions on this. And I'm trying to deconstruct your comments a bit. Is 2014 a year where you really start to see the steady state net benefits from this exposure?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. I mean, overall, our health care business, kind of across our health care business, is about $2.5 billion in revenue, just to give you an overall sizing. As we look forward, it is one of the fastest-growing areas that we have within BPO, and we expect that to continue to take place. We've always been and are #1 in terms of MMIS. As we look at the opportunity of standing up the Nevada health insurance exchange, I think that's an area where as states look to move from the federal system and implement their own exchanges, that's a great area of growth and participation for us. We also participate in private exchanges. So as companies look to move to, I'll call it, more of a defined contribution approach to how they support health care for their employees and trying to give their employees then a lot more freedom of choice for what they choose to then purchase. We're also participating in that market, and I think that's clearly another area of growth. And some of the things we bring to the table there is both our ability to stand up for somebody, I'll call it, a portal for employees to come to and choose, an ability to kind of go in and look at their employees' demographics and actually choose providers then that will kind of go into that network that are a good fit for their employee base. And then we put all of the support around that as well. So I think those are a couple of different areas where we have really good growth opportunities. And we continue to be really bullish. I mean, we participate, really, across this industry. We come at it from a bunch of different ways. That gives us a lot of insight. I think we've been in this business for a long period of time. We've got a lot of expertise that we bring to the table, and we think it's going to be a very good area for us for years to come.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And one of the things that the previous questioner asked is something important to note. As Kathy said, we participate across the board. If you look at our pipeline, our signings, our pipeline, if you look at the percentage of our BPO and ITO business that is actually focused on health care, it's all positive signs, which is good. We kind of surround this from government payer, provider, employer. It's a good participation. It's hard to do. It's hard to stand them up. I'm very pleased that we've actually been able to stand up exchanges and an MMIS system actually operating, taking customers' calls, et cetera, et cetera. It cost a little bit more than we thought. It would cost -- and that's one of the pressures that we saw in the third and we'll see a little bit in fourth. But we have done it now. And so the bulk of the investment won't have to change. We have to modify for every engagement a little bit of the system, but not as big a modification as before. And that's one of the things that we are learning. I think other people are learning it as well. So I'm actually pleased with health care. It's a big piece of our business, and I think we have some proof points that will show it will be good on a go-forward business as well.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If I could just have one follow-up, another area of Services. Looking at Document Outsourcing, you guys have had a leadership position here in the past. But the competition is getting pretty intense, and we're seeing some pretty good numbers from some of your smaller competitors, suggesting they're starting to gain share at a fairly rapid clip. Given that this is such an important part of the Services business but also an important secular counter to what's going on in the Technology business over time, can you talk about how you're looking at your market share momentum here and what you could possibly do to -- to reaccelerate it from here?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I'm just going to start and then I'll have Kathy answer some of the details. We are extremely pleased with Document Outsourcing. The last 3 quarters, last 2 in particular, it actually outperformed even our expectations. The external market actually sees us as a market leader, independent assessors do. And our growth would dictate that we're a market leader as well. And I don't think that your statement that competitors are gaining share at a pretty rapid clip is actually true vis-a-vis us. Actually it's not so at all. So...", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes, I think importantly, right, we're the folks who invented Managed Print Services. As a result, we've been in this business for a longer period of time. I think we're much more evolved. And we have a bigger base of business that we're growing off of. So rather than having a business that's in its relative infancy, where kind of in the beginning, you get really big growth rates because you're growing off a very small base. We have a much more sizable business here to start with, and we've been very pleased with our growth rate. One of the things Ursula just mentioned in terms of third parties taking a look at our offering and putting us against our competitors and really feeling like we're incredibly strong positioned, recently, Gartner came out with a study showing us that in their metric [ph] quadrant, which is where this Managed Print Services Document Outsourcing resides, that we actually gained some distance on our competitors recently. And so that's in part because we have a very fulsome vision and really, really good execution in this area. And as we look at, I'll say, the synergies between our Services business and our Document Technology business, this is really one area where we're continuing to evolve, right, into workflow from our Document Technology side of the business through Managed Print Services and Document Outsourcing. And that's a natural adjacency then over to our Services business, right, where we have Business Process Outsourcing. So that's where those 2 businesses meet. We've been at this for a long period of time. We've got deep vertical expertise. We feel great about this area of our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Chris Whitmore with Deutsche Bank.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I wanted to ask a couple of follow-up questions on topics that were covered earlier, specifically around the margin impact from renewals and new business signings. How did those 2 factors come into play as we think about 2014 margins in Services?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "In this area, I would say it's normal course of business. We always know as we renew business that we're typically giving some level of discount. It isn't as if the pressure that we're seeing is any more or less than -- we always understand that, as we're heading into this business. It's all about we stand up new business, we get more productive and efficient over the course of the contract period, preparing for the fact that we're going to have a price decrease as we renew that business. So there's nothing new or different in that.", "Chris Whitmore - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "When I listen to the puts and takes around Services margins heading into next year, it sounds like there's a lot more puts than takes. So maybe can you clarify, do you think margins will be flat or up or down in Services in 2014?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Certainly, I would say with regard to the fourth quarter of this year, I'd agree there's more puts than takes, which is why we're expecting to see a year-over-year margin decline. We're going to talk more about 2014 at our Investor Conference, but I would not at all conclude that we'd see more puts than takes as we head into 2014. And I'd specifically refer to a big opportunity that we have, which is to shift more of our labor mix offshore, right? So that's a very big opportunity for us and an opportunity that, from an execution basis, is a bit still in its infancy today, takes some planning, takes some time to implement, but it's certainly something that we're looking to do in a very aggressive way and in a way that we think will be impactful in 2014. Another thing I would just point to that we're doing, where we get secondary benefit from more offshoring, is we entered into a strategic relationship with Cognizant, who helps us on platform development implementation. And it's kind of a secondary way for us to get a little bit more offshoring exposure because they obviously bring a lot of that to the table, as well as great expertise that's helping us to successfully stand up some of these new platforms.", "Ursula M. Burns", "So just so we're not confused on the puts and takes because I'm a little bit confused on which one is the put and which one is the take or what you mean by it. I think just so that we're clear on the call, I would expect we'll get into significantly more detail on this in November at the investor conference. But we expect not margin expansion, margin improvement to be in the range of 10% to 12% in 2014. I don't know if you'd consider that a put or a take, but that's what we expect to be.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And a lot of the questions have been focused on the Services, which I think is very warranted, given what the stock is reacting in the big change there. So I'm going to again focus on that because I think that's the real struggle. I understand how you're talking about the trailing 12 months of Services, but this quarter, the signings took a real big decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, and the profitability for both this quarter and outlook appears to be materially below your expectations, now dipping below 10% compared to, you said, 10% to 12% in the lower end of the range of that just a few months ago. So can you give us one more try of clarity of how we can get assurance that this isn't a perpetual trend? And shouldn't it then just rebound pretty remarkably for signings in Q4, if you talked about timing? Or was it just the first half of the year where it was unsustainably too high?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Okay, I'll take a couple of different pieces of it, and if I don't touch on them all, please come back with your follow-up because you had a couple of different things. So a, year-over-year growth in signings for the quarter was down 7%. It was down because we did not have as rich, as high volume renewal opportunity in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, Services signings are up 30%. Okay, so quarter-to-quarter, sometimes, we have a big renewal opportunity; sometimes, we have a smaller renewal opportunity. This particular quarter, we had a smaller renewal opportunity. But year-to-date, our signings overall are up. If we look overall at some of the pressure we're seeing in margin, I'd start with this quarter's margin was 9.9%. We said we expect it to be at the low end of the range of 10% to 12%. That's 10 basis points below the target. Overall for the full year, we said we think we're going to be a little bit lower than 10%, again, a little bit lower. We're now kind of cutting hairs a little bit. But on a year-to-date basis, our margin is 10 -- I'm sorry, 9.8% in Services. So our margin is a little bit lower. We're not talking leaps and bounds here. We're talking a little bit of margin pressure. And as we look towards 2014, as Ursula just mentioned, we're expecting we're going to see margin expansion. Some of the margin pressure that we're seeing are from factors that their nature is they're going to be short term, and we will start to lap them in 2014. The runoff of the student loan business overall is clearly one of those factors. The fact that we haven't had any contribution from acquisitions, which are typically margin accretive, are another one of those factors. We've had a little more pressure on margins as we have stood up some of these new platforms. That's not unusual, but these things are now going to become for us repeatable processes, right? We will get better because of experience and we'll get better because of scale. So as I look forward into 2014, I think we've got great opportunities in the health care sector. Overall, our year-to-date signings growth has been really positive. The weak quarter of signings is really just because we didn't have a big renewal opportunity. So overall, I think the underlying factors here continue to be really solid, and we're looking forward to margin expansion and our growth rate picking up next year.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And as a quick follow-up, so with that expansion next year, I assume that also includes the additional cost of ramps, the additional cost of Affordable Health Care Act that's coming in, and so we are not looking at setting up for 10% to 12% range for expansion. And then coming back with a justification 3 or 6 months down the road of additional costs of ramping. I want to make sure you have involved some ramping costs in that.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. In a normal quarter, George -- I mean, Jim, we would actually -- if there was ups or downs, I mean, we basically would just cover those in our -- in the range that we have. So for '14, I would expect that we would do that like we do anything. We have some volumes up, we have volumes down, we have start-up costs up, et cetera. This fourth quarter -- this quarter, we actually came in pretty close. I mean, it's, as Kathy said, very, very narrow differences. We came in pretty close to where we expected to come out in margin, in revenue, in earnings, actually a little bit higher in earnings. Fourth quarter, we see headwinds, temporary headwinds. And then in '14, we expect to actually just be in a regular roll, like we are in most of the quarters in '13. And it's important, Jim, as well that you understand the signings dynamic. We've had a couple of quarters since we've brought ACS and gotten deeper into the Services business. We've had quarters where we had low renewals, and we've been trying to be very clear about how to actually look at those. And when you have a low renewal volume, they do have an impact because of the way that we calculate this or the industry calculates this. It has an impact on the signings number. And that's one of the reasons why it's important to not just look at the quarter, which we actually do focus on, but to look at all of the signings for the quarter, the new business signings for the quarter, the renewals that are available and the renewal rate. And so we try to give you all of that data. Signings, renewals, new business, et cetera, should not be a concern. All of the numbers look good from a go-forward basis, from a revenue perspective in Services across all of the businesses.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz with JPMorgan.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First, I want to second -- Ben's motion regarding more transparent or cleaner cash flow reporting. I think just given investors are really focused on that dynamic. As far as my questions, kind of along that same line of thought. Kathy, can you just remind us in terms of what your priority is with the Services business going forward? Is it top line growth? Or is it Services margin? Because I think -- I'm just trying to figure out how you really jump start the Services revenue growth profile going forward. Is it going to really be about acquisitions? And if it is going to be acquisitions, doesn't that kind of steal from capital allocation in terms of stock buyback, which has been a big part of investor psychology right now?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So the focus is profit expansion, and I say that's the focus across our entire business. In terms of how we get to profit expansion, I do think that we have a very good opportunity in getting to profit expansion in the Services business by growth, as well as by margin expansion. So there, I expect to actually see both things occur. With respect to acquisitions, we've been light on acquisitions. The reason I've been talking about the fact that acquisition is a factor because it historically accounted for 2 to 3 points of revenue growth within Xerox business services. And right now, we're not getting any revenue growth or profit growth, for that matter, from acquisition. But I don't expect it at all to take away from our balanced approach in terms of capital allocation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Kulbinder Garcha with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "James H. Lesko", "If Kulbinder is not able to pick up, I think we are close to our end time. So I think we should say that's all we have for questions today. And Ursula, do you have anything else you'd like to wrap up with?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes. So thanks, Jim. We covered a lot of ground this morning. So let me bring it up a couple of levels. Q3 results and our continued focus on squarely and effectively implementing a sound and consistent strategy, which is to be Services-led and to grow, profitable leadership from our Document Technology business, cash generating annuity-based business model, to deliver consistent EPS expansion and financial strength to invest in building value for Xerox and in building value for you. That's our focus. I'm confident that we'll deliver, and hope that you can join us or listen in to our Investor Conference on November 12.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula.

[Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we're reporting our fourth quarter earnings that are largely in line with the expectations that we communicated last quarter. We managed the anticipated impact of headwinds in a handful of businesses while we continue to build in the areas of strength and future profits.", "Let's begin with the review of the strategy. Our shift to a services-led company requires us to constantly enhance our offerings and deliver unique Xerox solutions to our customers. They partner with us because we help them take the complexities out of their business processes. For example, we're simplifying services in government health care with Enterprise, our system for Medicaid. And we're creating smart parking solutions like Merge, a real-time analysis-based technology that addresses urban parking challenges.", "Our Managed Print Services have been awarded highest honors for global market leadership by industry analyst firms, a distinction that validates the strength of our Document Outsourcing business. In our Services business, we are continuing with the implementation of the 5-plank strategy that we reviewed at the November investor conference, which includes improving our cost structure while supporting investments in areas where we see opportunity and differentiated benefits for our customers. We're maintaining our leadership in Document Technology and effectively managing this profitable business with strong cash characteristics.", "With a robust portfolio, we're capturing market share with new products like ConnectKey. We're transforming the Graphic Communications business with new workflow and digital automation services and we're growing our channels operation to expand our reach to small and medium businesses.", "And across both segments, Services and Technology, we have a keen focus on profitability. Delivering on these strategies will enable consistent earnings expansion and strong cash flow, which we are committed to deploy in a balanced way that will enhance shareholder value.", "Here is a closer look at Q4 results. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.29 and GAAP EPS of $0.25, with the difference being the amortization of intangible assets. Total revenues were down with Services flat, as the student loan runoff continued and we saw no benefit from acquisitions in our revenue. Services operating margin was lower than we planned. And although they were driven by known issues, which is an area where we need to make more structural progress, is a constant focus for us.", "Services signings were up 20% for the year, BPO and ITO renewal rates were at 92% and above our target range of 85% to 90%, both positive results that position us well for 2014.", "In Document Technology, revenue stabilized with positive results in Global Imaging and Graphic Communications, offsetting weaknesses in developing markets and Europe. Segment margins remained strong and above our target range, reflecting strong cost management and expense management.", "In total, operating margin was down 130 basis points year-over-year. A decline in margin was anticipated, given known headwinds, but nonetheless emphasizes why we are undertaking our margin improvement strategy in our continued need for a disciplined focus on operational excellence.", "Cash flow from operations came in at the high end of the full year range and we ended the year with $700 million of share repurchases. As we look to 2014, I'm pleased with the strategy that we've got in place to expand earnings. I'm confident that we have all that it takes to move our business forward and deliver value to our shareholders.", "With that, let me turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open up the call for questions.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula. And good morning, everyone. Much of Q4 played out as we expected, with the exception of Services margin, where we had more work to do. We hit our EPS and cash flow guidance and got a bit more done on share repurchases.", "We feel good about the continued positive trends in leading indicators, our strong cash flow and the progress we're making implementing our Services initiative to accelerate growth and improve margin in 2014.", "Let's start with a look at overall earnings. Revenue was down 3% or 4% at constant currency, with Services flat year-over-year or down 1% at constant currency and Document Technology down 6%. For the full year, Services was up 3% and Document Technology was down 6%.", "Document Technology declines were roughly in line with the full year and Services revenue growth decelerated as we faced a number of known headwinds that we guided to last quarter. Gross margin of 30.7% declined 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by a continued pressure on Services margin from startup of health care platform projects, student loan runoff as well as from volume declines, with higher pension settlement costs impacting primarily Document Technology.", "Our ongoing productivity initiatives drove improvements in RD&E and SAG, in line with the decline in revenue. This resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, down 130 basis points year-over-year, consistent with the decline in gross margin.", "Adjusted other net was $96 million, down $74 million year-over-year. There's a couple of drivers here. Within OID, there's a gain of $29 million associated with the sale of a portion of our Wilsonville, Oregon asset and product development resources. This was a win-win arrangement that enabled us to right-size our resources and further strengthen our 17-year relationship with 3D Systems.", "Notably, we retained our intellectual property, as well as capabilities in ink and print head development. The gain enabled us to do a greater level of restructuring in the quarter, with restructuring of $56 million coming in about $20 million higher than what we originally guided to and $35 million lower year-over-year.", "Our adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was in line with our guidance and modestly higher year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.29 was down $0.01 from 2012 and in the middle of our guidance range of $0.28 to $0.30.", "So in summary, we were pleased to deliver our EPS guidance but need to make more progress to fully overcome near-term headwinds and deliver sustainable earnings expansion.", "With that, I'll move to the Services segment slide to review in more detail the drivers there. Services revenue growth was flat with Document Outsourcing up 4%, ITO up 2% and BPO down 3%. Growth rates have decelerated and are playing out as we expected, with Document Outsourcing showing stable mid-single-digit growth and ITO growth tapering, consistent with the slowdown in signings.", "BPO growth has temporarily gone negative, reflecting no inorganic contributions, the toughest compare for student loans, as well as lower volumes than anticipated in customer care. We expect Q1 to show modest improvement in growth, driven by BPO. As compares improve, signings continue to ramp and we begin to see some inorganic contribution.", "Signings in Q4 were once again positive, with new business signings up 5%. Total contract value for all signings was flat due to less renewal opportunity in the quarter compared to the prior year. BPO total contract value was up 28% in the quarter, with strong growth in health care payer, health care provider, finance and accounting, as well as in Europe. For the year, BPO also had strong signings, with new business up 9%.", "Document Outsourcing overall signings were weaker in Q4 due to less renewal opportunities, but new business signings were up 1% and for the year were up 23%.", "ITO had lower signings as we continue to see trends toward smaller contract sizes and our focus remains executing on previous large deals and improving our margin. Renewal rate was also positive at 92% in Q4 and full year, which was 7 points higher than the full year 2012. Our new business signings, combined with our strong renewal rate, yielded total contract value growth of 21% for the year. The leading indicators are strong coming into 2014.", "Shifting to profitability. Segment margin was 9.6% in Q4, down 160 basis points year-over-year and a little lower than the roughly 10% we were targeting. The year-over-year drivers were largely anticipated, reflecting the effect of student loan runoff which peaks this quarter and caused us 60 basis points on margin and 1.5 points on revenue. It continued pressure from our new government health care Medicaid platform and health care exchanges and volume pressure in wireless customer care. That said, margin was a little lower than expected as a result of technology customer care volumes ramping up slower than forecasted and health care platform expenses coming in above our original forecast, as we've had to put even more resources towards improving our operational performance there.", "At the same time, we're in the early stage of implementing our 5-plank strategy in Services that we had outlined at our November investor conference. We expect benefits from these actions to build throughout 2014, improving trends in revenue growth and margin.", "Turning to Q1 guidance. We expect a modest improvement in Services revenue growth to approximately 1%. Our margin will be seasonally lower and we expect it to be at about the same level as the prior year margin of 9.3%.", "For the full year, we continue to expect at least a 50-basis-point margin improvement, with the greatest improvement coming in the second half of the year as near-term margin pressure dissipates and the impact of our margin improvement actions accelerate.", "I'll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at both actual and constant currency for both the fourth quarter and the full year. Equipment sales revenue was down 4% year-over-year in Q4, as relative strength in the U.S. and mid-range and high-end was more than offset by weakness in developing markets.", "The price revenue also declined in Q4 and was down 9%, with almost 1/2 of the decline the result of actions that we took to reduce channel inventories. Additionally, our previous finance receivable transactions negatively impact annuity revenue growth.", "High-end continued to perform well and had positive equipment revenue growth in the quarter as Color growth more than offset the Mono decline. We are gaining share in this segment and expect that positive momentum to continue.", "Mid-range had another solid install activity quarter. We had seen strong activity growth for the ConnectKey class of products since launching it last year and we continue to receive very positive customer and industry feedback.", "Finally, entry revenue was weak, driven by the continued weakness in developing markets, as well as the impact of channel inventory reduction. Overall, Document Technology margin was quite strong at 11.7% and although down 60 basis points year-over-year, reflected the ongoing benefits from cost and efficiency savings and a currency benefit from the weak yen.", "The 2 drivers of the margin decline were lower gains from finance receivable sales and higher pension settlement expense. On an absolute basis, this quarter's finance receivable transactions resulted in a $15 million gain, contributing 60 basis points to Technology segment margin. However, the gain was $6 million lower year-over-year.", "Higher pension settlements activity resulted in $36 million in higher expense for the company, the majority of which is in Document Technology. So overall, in-line performance for Document Technology for the quarter. Looking to Q1, we expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digits and margins up year-over-year.", "With that, let's turn to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was at the high end of guidance, with close to $1 billion generated in Q4 and $2.4 billion for the year. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion for the year, with CapEx of $427 million.", "Our cash flow results include a net benefit from finance receivable sales of approximately $130 million in Q4 and $300 million for the year, resulting in underlying cash flow from operations of $2.1 billion for the year, which compares to underlying cash flow of $2 billion in 2012.", "The $100 million year-over-year improvement was mainly due to lower pension funding as working capital was roughly flat for the year. It should be noted that working capital timing was purposefully smoothed out in 2013 and thus, we have less of a benefit in Q4 than prior years.", "Looking to 2014, we're maintaining our operating cash flow guidance of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion. This reflects our expectation of no finance receivable sales, with underlying cash flow of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. The drivers of underlying improvement include Services EBITDA growth as well as working capital gains. Consistent with our normal seasonality, we expect Q1 operating cash flow to be the lowest of the year, with forces roughly offsetting uses.", "Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $53 million use in the quarter. We spent $111 million on CapEx and had proceeds of $33 million from the 3D Systems transaction and $15 million from the Europe paper deal. We had no acquisitions in the fourth quarter and spent $155 million on acquisitions for the year.", "As previously communicated, acquisition spend was tracking below our full year plan of $300 million to $500 million. In December, we announced the Invoco acquisition, which expands our European customer care presence, but it just closed last week so it will be in our Q1 results.", "Cash from financing was a use of $100 million and included the issuance of $500 million in senior notes, $71 million in common dividend and $524 million in share repurchases, which put the full year repurchases total at approximately $700 million and resulted in a 36 million net reduction in shares for the year.", "Moving to the next slide, I'll walk through our capital structure and capital allocation plan for 2014. We ended the year with $8 billion in debt, which is $500 million higher than our September ending balance, driven by our early December $500 million senior note offering. Given attractive rates, the offering was $200 million higher than originally planned, which will prefund a portion of the roughly $1.1 billion senior notes that comes to maturity in May of this year.", "Applying 7:1 leverage on financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.6 billion. Our financing debt continued to decline, driven by the finance receivable transaction and lower originations.", "Our capital allocation plan is as follows: on debt, in light of the $200 million prefunding, we expect to refinance about $900 million of the $1.1 billion in debt that comes due in May; on share repurchase, we continue to plan to do at least $500 million in 2014 and expect those repurchases to be more evenly spaced through the year; on acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $500 million. With the recent Invoco acquisition, we're off to a better start than in 2013 and I feel good about the quality and progression of the deals in our pipeline. And finally, for dividends, we're announcing today a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.0625 per share. This will result in spend of approximately $300 million, which is only modestly higher year-over-year, as share repurchases have served to help self-fund the increase.", "Strong 2013 operating cash flow, combined with the lower level of acquisition spend and larger December debt offering, resulted in a year-end cash position in excess of $1.7 billion, providing upside to our capital allocation plan.", "So in summary, we enter 2014 on solid footing. Document Technology is performing well, with stabilized revenue declines, a strong market position and continued good profitability and cash flow. In Services, we're well underway in implementing our 5-plank strategy that includes not only cost initiatives but also active portfolio management to drive growth and direct investments towards our higher-margin, more differentiated offerings. And we feel good about our cash position, cash flow and ability to continue to drive shareholder return through balanced capital allocation.", "Looking at Q1, at a consolidated level, we expect revenue will still be somewhat pressured and down low single-digits, with Document Technology down mid-single digits and services growth modestly improving to roughly 1%. And for margin, we anticipate it will be seasonally lower, with Services roughly flat and Document Technology up year-over-year. As a result, we expect earnings per share of $0.23 to $0.25 for the first quarter, which includes approximately $0.01 for restructuring.", "With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Thanks, Kathy. Our performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year reflected our ability to deliver bottom line results while we continued working to strengthen our operational delivery capabilities for the long term.", "Services signings are growing as we continue to win in the marketplace and strive to differentiate our offerings to deliver state-of-the-art platforms and innovative world-class solutions to customers around the world.", "On Document Technology, business is stable. We're gaining market share, we're keeping cost down and we're delivering advanced products in key areas of the printing industry. Both of these contribute to a healthy annuity stream that will benefit our long-term performance.", "Throughout 2014, our focus will be on executing our Services strategy. This strategy is designed to promote revenue growth and improve margins. We continue to plan for at least 50 basis points of margin improvement in the Services segment. We'll capitalize on the most advantaged segments of the Document Technology business to maintain our leadership position in the industry. And we'll continue to deliver healthy cash flow during the dynamics of our attractive recurring revenue business model.", "With this in mind, we are reaffirming our 2014 guidance and we announced today a $0.02 increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.25 a share. I'm confident that we have the right strategy, the competitive strength, the dedicated workforce and the disciplined focus on execution to build on our progress.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn it over to Jim.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. Also, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citi.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A quick question on the Services. It sounds like that you had to invest a little bit more for the health care. If indeed that is correct, if you can confirm it. And I assume it was probably just you wanted to make sure it pulled off without any bumps. And that being said, can you let us know going forward, it sounds like the 50 basis points improvement is still indeed intact. As we look forward to 2014 in the Services areas, are there any more roll-offs or headwinds? I know student loans, I think, is going to impact by about 25 basis points, but anything else like more renewals, more large contracts, more that could impact pricing? Or do you pretty much have a pretty firm grasp on what's going on with the Services now as 2014 rolls out?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I'll start with the health care investments and then I'll turn it over to Kathy for the -- to answer the rest. Health care, you are correct. We actually made a conscious necessary decision to invest more particularly in the roll-off of the health exchange -- of our health exchange platform in the state that we are heavily involved in, that's one investment. We had already expected, which we actually communicated last quarter, to invest a little bit more, but we actually went even beyond that to assure that we respond to any needs that the clients in the state had. We'll continue to do that. I think it will be less necessary as we go forward, if you know what I mean. We're at a level I don't think we have to go very much above. This is an area that for quarter four we made sure that we didn't step -- we didn't fall any further behind and that we actually serve the client on the ground very well. Kathy will talk about the 50 basis points in additional headwinds.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And so, Jim, at this point, I think we have our headwinds very well understood and recognized. And if you look at where we had guided to a quarter ago and talking about what impacts we thought we were going to see, I think we were roughly in line there with the only additional pressure that we saw, really, as Ursula just mentioned and as you mentioned, looking to put more resources behind, standing up successfully those health care platform implementations that we had.", "If I look at the progression for improving 50 basis points in 2014, as we talked about on our investor conference, it's naturally back-end loaded as you look at the known pressures and how those known pressures will dissipate during the course of the year. So a good example of that is I've mentioned that as a result of the implementation of our new Enterprise MMIS platform, we're drawing amortization now. We will lap that beginning in the second quarter and so that year-over-year impact in pressure will start to dissipate.", "With respect to student loan, right, which caused 60 basis points of the pressure in the quarter and 1.5 points of pressure on revenue, when we get to the fourth quarter of next year, we actually lap the government piece of that business just going away. And in terms of that margin pressure, you're absolutely correct. It lightens up year-over-year. And again, that's a little bit more back half end loaded, which is why you're going to see the progression of our margin improvement throughout the year.", "And I'd say similarly in terms of the pressure we're seeing on revenue, we feel great about forward indicators and our ramp, basically bringing BPO revenue growth coming back kind of beginning towards the end of the first quarter and then building into the year. So that gives you a little bit on the puts and takes for what we think the progression is going to look like.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Great. And as a follow-up, for this year, any both size or quantity of renewals coming up we should be aware of? Like more than last year or any potential, Hey, in Q3, we have a lot more than normal or 5 mega deals coming up for renewal. Anything we should just be aware of, conscious of for 2014?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "So yes, the only thing that I would flag is we had a really strong first quarter of 2013 in terms of total signings. I think the number is $3.7 billion. And so we have a tough compare in the first quarter. But there's really nothing else going on in that. I spoke to, a little bit in my prepared remarks, the overall kind of composition in terms of mix. One of the things that we talked about at our investor conference was really a focus on improving mix, both taking resources and making sure that we're adequately putting resources where we have high-margin business.", "We're trying to accelerate growth, data analytics obviously being a component of that continued innovation. But as you look at kind of the mix of new business and as you look at the overall mix of signings, it is skewing towards places where we do have high margins. And so that, again, over the course of the year, is going to help us to actually mix up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "So my first question is on restructuring. I mean, you took over $100 million of the restructuring charges this year -- or, I guess, in '13. You're planning on taking, I think, at least that amount in '14, probably. What -- can you give us an idea of exactly where those dollars are focused, how we're seeing the benefit even if not necessarily in margins because of other things that are going on within the business, but if you can just sort of give us an idea of what you sort of focus on in '13 and how you're going to shift the dollars and focus in '14? So we get an idea of sort of what support level might be behind some of the margin improvement.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Sure. I'll speak to the fourth quarter in terms of the restructuring we did in the fourth quarter. A fair amount of that was targeted towards the U.S., targeted towards back office. And then we're starting to see more restructuring within Services and expect that as we progress into 2014, in part associated with looking to shift a greater percentage of our total labor base towards low-cost countries.", "On the technology side of the business, restructuring is really normal course. It is what we have to continue to do in responding to the overall pressure of that business to ensure that we're maintaining strong margin. And so I feel really good about what we see coming in on the bottom line as a result of that restructuring. And that is a good portion of the total dollars that we spend because restructuring is more expensive on the technology side of the business than it is on the services side of the business. But we will continue to see that.", "And when we talked about it at the investor conference, we said that we expect to have at least as much restructuring in 2014 as 2013. And obviously, we've guided to $0.01 of restructuring expected right now in the first quarter. We did a little bit more restructuring in the fourth quarter. We started out with guidance of $0.02, we ended up doing $0.03. But that's going to continue and we feel good about the savings that, that drives.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then, Ursula, maybe if you can talk a bit about what's going on within both technology and DO in terms of underlying trends. It sounds like U.S. is relatively stable but emerging markets are weakening. Your low-end printers were under pressure but you had strength in color. So if you can just frame sort of what you're hearing from your customers, what specifically is going on, why annuity was down 6%? Anything you can provide there would be helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, let me give you a -- thanks, Shannon. Let me give you a kind of run around the world from a technology standpoint and then by the line of business, and then I'll give you a wrap-up on services. What we're seeing in the U.S. in enterprise accounts is a little bit of uptick, a little bit of uptick, primarily focused around our Document Outsourcing offering. If you look at the signings there, we are seeing no signings, U.S. signings increase. And I think that's a little bit of a bright spot for us.", "We still have to stand them all up, implement them, et cetera. So and then in small- and medium-sized businesses in the U.S., we're seeing a pickup, and that's primarily because of our partner in print services as well and also because we have an unbelievable channel there, a channel that's doing extremely well and taking share, that's our Global Imaging business. So U.S., pretty much par for the course, fairly normal and working very well in technology and fairly well in services.", "Europe, you may see a twinkle of light in certain areas, but it's pretty much the same. Business, we haven't seen a significant change in the European marketplace, up or down, throughout 2013. And our outlook for 2014 is pretty much the same. We are going to increase our focus on operationalizing some of the cost reductions that we have there. Some of the restructuring that we have is focused on that area, counting on the fact that we're not going to have a big upturn in the economy. We're just going to continue to drive through efficiencies, so we can keep our profitability in that portion of the market strong.", "Developing economies is the place that we saw, primarily Russia and Eastern Europe, are the places that we saw a significant change in trend quarter 3 to quarter 4 significantly. We saw a change in trend quarter 3 to quarter 4. Some of that was driven by us. We literally, as we've talked about in the third quarter change and try to drive down our channel inventory actually to protect ourselves to make sure that we actually don't leave a lot of things stranded in the channel. So we've moved down our channel inventory, which dampened our revenue. But also we saw just market weakness in Russia and Eastern Europe. It's a big market for us, it's a very profitable market for us. We are still very successful there, but just the general overall market activity is lower there.", "In Services, we are seeing strength in signings in Europe, which is a good leading indicator for us. We started to sign more in Europe, signings are up about -- over 20% in Europe, which is really good. We have a good base. We put in place some activities a year ago, a little bit more than a year ago and they're starting to come to fruition. And the rest of the globe is pretty much normal from a Services standpoint.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to ask about what some of the positives could be to margins during the year. Is there an incremental benefit you're going to see on the cost side from the yen? And can we also just talk a little bit about, on the Services side, a little bit more the timing when the -- when like student loan reverses and then what quarters that could be a year-over-year benefit and whatnot? We talked about some of the hits, I think, in detail in the beginning of the year and if we could talk about the positives as we flow through, that would be helpful in both divisions.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And so overall in terms of just positive impacts on margin, one of the things I talked about at the November investor conference was an expectation that we were actually going to get some relief on the pension side of the house. So I mentioned that pension settlement expenses were up $36 million in the fourth quarter. And a big part of that cost was we printed the discount rate that's used to determine people's pension benefits in August and that was sort of -- I'll call it a blip of an upturn in August. And so that caused people rightfully, who are trying to I say optimize their economics to choose to take their pension at the lower discount rate in December.", "And so we had a lot more activity in terms of people coming into what I call the cash register to cash out their pension towards the end of the year. So we continue to expect we're going to get margin uplift in terms of just overall lower pension expense next year. We also expect that we'll get some benefit in terms of yen flowing through to gross margin in the technology business. It's going to be, I'd say, not quite to the same degree as we got this year.", "In total this year, we got about a $60 million benefit. We expect that next year is probably going to be roughly $40 million. So those are some upsides. And then as you just talk about other activity that's going to assist us in margin, the slowing of ITO growth relative to BPO growth over the course of the year helps us to naturally mix up.", "The signings that we're now ramping up and implementing are more heavily weighted towards higher-margin businesses. So if I went back to the bubble chart that I talked about at the November investor conference, those bubbles that are -- they're naturally higher-margin businesses starting to pick up a higher gross rate as a result of positive signings activity. So those are some of the puts and takes.", "Benjamin A. Reitzes - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Great. On the buyback side, too, is that more front-end loaded? Maybe you said that. I am sorry if I missed it.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes, I said today and I certainly said at the investor conference, we have an expectation to do share repurchases throughout the year, right? If you looked at our activity in 2013, we did a little bit in the third quarter and then we did a whole lot in the fourth quarter and that isn't exactly what we would like to see. So we're already repurchasing shares this year. To date, as we sit here today, we've done about $45 million worth of share repurchases. But what you should see is more of a steady progression over the course of the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montr\u00e9al.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "I have 2 questions. The first is on a scene we've brought up before and it's labeled, \"consistency in services.\" So it doesn't seem like it's changed much, in that your Analyst Day was on November 12 and you talked about 10% operating margins there and it came in at 9.6%. And then I don't think any investors saw it during the quarter, certainly from leaving that meeting or any time during the quarter, that Services revenue growth would be down 1% in constant currency for the quarter. So my question is what is Xerox doing to improve the consistency, particularly of the Services when -- you have 45 days left in the quarter, I think investors would generally say that they're disappointed with the performance of Services relative to the message communicated at the investor event.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "So a couple of things. I'd start with we said that we thought we'd get to roughly 10% margin for the quarter. At Investor Day, I said I thought full year would be anywhere between 9.8% and 10% for the full year. We're obviously at the low end of that. And we actually guided to Services overall revenue being about flat for the quarter and so it was flat on an actual basis. So we're little bit off, I would say. I wouldn't say that we're a lot off.", "And overall in terms of the trajectory as we go forward, there is a lot that we are changing to improve the overall trajectory of Services. But there's a number of things that are one-time, right? And not, I say on a long-term basis, systemic to the business. So when you look at the revenue pressure that we're currently facing, student loan and the reduction in wireless coming largely from a single customer account that was very large is a temporary transitional issue. Similarly, M&A, which last year in the fourth quarter, gave us 2 points of revenue and this quarter gave us nothing and starting to now see that activity pick up this year, is again a transitory issue.", "If we look at what we're doing in terms of executing our 5-plank Services strategy, I'd say our forward indicators look good in terms of improving our mix in business kind of clearly starts part of that strategy. M&A is off to a better start. We've got a very keen granular focus and higher level of engagement in terms of really managing the KPIs around the strategy execution.", "We're continuing right now to put more resources behind areas of growth. A great example would be WDS, which we've talked about does analytics in our customer care telecom space, investing more there, more heavily in R&D in order to build additional platforms so that we can go into additional verticals. So I'd say we're doing a whole lot in terms of really actively managing our strategic execution to ensure that we get the improving trajectory that we talked about in 2014.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. Well, that relates to my follow-up, Kathy. And at Analyst Day, you had talked about growth in '14 of 0% to 2% consolidated. And I just want to revisit on your conviction around those numbers. But as part of that, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about M&A contributing to that number. And specifically if you could talk about how much the deal that you already completed will help in the March quarter?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "So the deal that we completed, I'll give you what we spent on the deal and then I'll help you to roughly size it. It was a $60 million deal. With regard to the overall trajectory of M&A, we're starting from 0, right? We obviously expect the positive contribution and we expect that to ramp over the course of the year.", "We have a fair amount of conviction about not continuing to underspend in M&A, with a focus and discipline around ensuring that we do high-quality good deals that are going to drive good returns for our shareholders. So we feel good about that and making sure that we're focused strategically. And that we're looking at deals where we're going to have synergies to help us be more competitive on price pressure. Our pipeline continues to be pretty robust as well, kind of up mid- to high single-digits. And so we feel good about the leading indicators in Services.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "So yes, I saw some fairly healthy metrics in the Services segment over the past 12 months around signings and retention rates and in pipeline growth, particularly in the BPO segment. So looking out in 2014, what areas are you targeting in terms of penetrating growth opportunities? And how should those metrics translate into Services revenue performance?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And so if you look at services revenue performance and the fact that we were, on an actual basis on top line, flat for this quarter, guiding to about 1% growth. In the first quarter, we're expecting to see a positive progression from there as we continue to ramp up the positive signing numbers that you referenced, as well as start to pick up on M&A activity with one deal already over the finish line right now.", "And as I mentioned earlier, the composition of the new business that we've been booking and if you look at the composition of total signings, it's really skewing more towards higher-margin businesses, which should start to give us some tailwind as opposed to a headwind in terms of overall margin. So payer provider overall, retail, federal government, U.S. transportation, these are all businesses that are already at very good margin. And the fact that those growth rates should increase relative to other businesses like ITO, as an example, really should help us in overall margins.", "One of the things that I mentioned at Investor Day is 2/3 of our BPO portfolio is already at a 10% or above margin. So by continuing to look to accelerate growth of the higher-margin businesses, we should really start to give ourselves a little bit more help during the course of the year.", "Ursula M. Burns", "And when -- we were not at a 10% margin, George, government health care is an area that we're not -- we're making progress. We're really focused, as I said, in responding to the first question on making sure that we get this right. And we do not, like I said, put any additional risk or pressure on any state. But as we do that, we are stabilizing more and more. And so throughout 2014, this significant investment that we're making -- that we made in '13 and is a trail on with '12 should start to pay off with more accretive performance, accretive results to the company. I'm very confident of that. We have a lot of energy around it. And it's not totally visible to -- the detail is not totally visible to the investors, but there's a lot of energy behind it to make sure that we get it right and that we don't, like I said, risk our customers.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And the one other thing I would just add on government health care is we stood up a lot of things in 2013, right? So we implemented a new MMIS platform in New Hampshire. We implemented one in Alaska. We obviously have the lead on the Nevada health insurance exchange and we supported a handful of other health insurance exchanges at other states. So that's a lot of things to stand up in government health care in a given year. And as I look forward to 2014, we have one MMIS customer that we're standing up. But on a relative basis, year-over-year, it is nothing in comparison to everything that we had to stand up this year.", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And as a follow-up question, do evolving costs to stand up health care contracts alter the individual components of your bridge to get to 50 basis points of margin expansion? And if you can also give us an update on how Project Compete is tracking according to plan?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. And so it really doesn't, I'd say overall, alter the bridge that I talked about at Investor Day. I'd say with regard to the progression on government health care, I'd already taken into consideration, I talked about the amortization of the platform, which has a big expense and the fact that we'll lap that year-over-year. Sorry, to the second part of your question, George?", "George K. Tong - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Project Compete.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So Project Compete is well underway. I mentioned it a little bit earlier that we're very engaged in ensuring that we're driving kind of KPIs down to the lowest level in the business. A great example of that would be Ursula and I were on a call with, I'll call it, 25-ish folks across the Services organization earlier this week, really walking through their KPIs across all of the metrics we're tracking on strategic execution. Obviously, Project Compete is one piece of how we intend to get labor costs as a percent of revenue down. That's about Project Compete. It's also about just getting more efficient and more effective, implementing technology and automation tools across our customer care centers and the like to just drive overall productivity. So we feel good about the overall program and are very engaged to ensure that we're well executing there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.", "Kulbinder Garcha - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The question I have -- both questions actually on Services. The first one is if you guys are spending so much on M&A, your organic growth rate in Services this year is very close to 0. Is that roughly right or will it actually grow? And what percent of long-term revenue growth rate we should think about in that business once you've gone through this transition period?", "And then on the margin from Q1 to Q4, let's say, as we go through this year in Services, actually, I wanted to understand that Q1 will be the trough, it sounds like. And then the ramp is a combination of the runoff in offsetting some of the cost initiatives and just standard leverage. There's nothing else that has to happen to you to, let's say, do a 11% or slightly above that margin in the fourth quarter in Services? Is that the right way of thinking of it?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes, it is. So I'll start with the second part of your question. That's all it is, is the ramp over the course of the year and that's exactly how you should think about it. Obviously, with the guidance of our margin in 1Q being roughly the same year-over-year, it suggests that we've got to get to reasonably above 10% for the remainder of the year. But my expectation in terms of the year-over-year ramp is that it's going to start out slower in terms of year-over-year gains and obviously, it's going to be second half of the year loaded.", "If I then flip back to your first question, which started with, hey, with all of the spend on M&A, I mean, I'll kind of start there and say we -- it isn't as if we've had a lot of spend on M&A and we certainly didn't guide to a different overall target number, really, than we've been trying to execute to previously. So historically, M&A has given the company 2 to 3 points in revenue growth. We're not expecting that we're going to get a wildly different answer in terms of overall growth from M&A. We're just looking to get M&A activity back up to where it's been historically.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "And I guess 2 from me. The first one would be, can you give us a sense of how we should expect BPO revenue to ramp, I guess, through this year and into '15? And kind of what the components and the timing of those components are, even if the components are the removal of headwinds like student loan runoff, kind of the government and commercial as we go into '15? And should we expect or is it your expectation that BPO get back to mid-single digits in '15 or, I guess more specifically, entering 2015. And then I have a quick follow-up.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Sure. So overall, I'll start with the last part of the question. BPO will get up to mid-single digits, but that's not where it's going to start at the beginning of the year, obviously. If you look at where we ended 4Q overall in terms of Services, right, when BPO being down year-over-year and first quarter, BPO may be down kind of marginally still but kind of quickly then ramping up to be positive. So some of the factors in terms of how we lap some of the pressures that we're currently facing, right? In the fourth quarter, the student loan pressure on revenue, 1.5 points. That's the worst quarter we're going to see.", "Overall, the way that progresses in 2014 is it gets much lighter when we hit the fourth quarter because that's when we hit the compare in terms of the federal government piece of the overall student loan business going away. Right now in the fourth quarter, the wireless volume pressures that we talked about in customer care caused about 1 point decline in the fourth quarter on revenue. That will dissipate over the course of the year. So when we get to the back half of the year, that pressure, basically, falls away. And then M&A, which year-over-year was a 2-point decline on revenue, no contribution versus the prior quarter of about 2 points of revenue. We would expect that will ramp over the course of the year.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division", "Got it. That's helpful. And then, I guess, actually this is my follow-up. Then as we get into '15, are we -- what are the headwinds that remain in '15 of the ones [indiscernible]?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. So the only headwinds are the things that we talked about that we'd expect in 2015 is student loan is 2 pieces. And I just talked about the government piece, which when we get to the fourth quarter of '14, we totally lap that business going away. So overall, student loan portfolio will continue in slow decline, so we will still have a negative impact when we get to '15. But it's not going to be anything near the numbers that we've been talking about. So we're calling attention to it, obviously, because it's having a big impact right now. By the time we get to 2015, yes, there will be an impact but it's nothing near what we're talking about now.", "Ursula M. Burns", "All right. In addition, and by the time we get to 2015, a lot of the contracts that we signed in '13 and '14 will have ramped. We're seeing that benefit today, just early portions of it. Particularly, our technology customer care business that's actually doing very, very well. That's going to ramp. And by the time we get through 2014, it will be at the ramp stage.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes. And we're obviously focused talking about BPO or BPO/ITO. With respect to Document Outsourcing, Document Outsourcing, new business signings were up 23% this year as well. And strategically, we're incredibly strong -- strongly positioned there. I've talked about previously the fact that Gartner has put us in a \"Magic Quadrant.\" We've got a new leader, which is well positioned there. So that also will assist us on the Services segment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz from JPMorgan.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is Lynn Blodgett on the call right now?", "Ursula M. Burns", "No, he's not. He's dealing with personal medical situation. We expect him back on the next call.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, good. I'll hope the best for his recovery there. The reason I ask, I just think it's just been pretty point-blank here today about how important Services is. I was just hoping we could ask a few questions of him, but we'll wait until another day on that. But maybe I can just talk a little about the Services M&A ambitions here because it was definitely absent last year and that was always kind of one of the hallmarks of ACS in terms of the M&A funnel or activity. What has changed now? You're feeling a little more confident we can move forward with acquisitions. Did it have to do with just given that the cost structure in order or the balance sheet in order? Or do you guys have to assemble a new team under Kathy's leadership around M&A and integration and all that stuff? I'm just kind of curious what's changed in that. Why you're feeling a little more confident about making M&A.", "Ursula M. Burns", "I'll have Kathy respond to the actual operational piece and how she does it. Let me just make sure that I make clear what did change in M&A from a strategic standpoint when we acquired ACS. We are significantly more pointed about what we want to acquire. Margin accretive, global expanding, innovation-based acquisitions are what we are after. That selection funnel, obviously, makes it harder than before we have that funnel. So I think based on history of ACS and what we know about the margin progression and growth progression of this business, that funnel is the right funnel. Kathy will talk about the pipeline that we have in M&A better. Let me get it over to her now.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes, so I started we have one deal over the finish line [indiscernible] that I spoke about. We spent $60 million. That's already a level that's higher than what we did last year because while we did 3 deals, they were all quite small. When I first joined the company, I would have told you that the pipeline was light. And as you know, M&A just kind of ebbs and flows. Our pipeline has built over that period of time. It matured. We obviously have 1 deal that's over the finish line. We've actually added resources into that M&A group.", "And then I'd say the other thing we're doing is working really closely with the businesses in trying to generate what I call non-brokered deals. And so looking for our pipeline to also have a number of deals that we have been through the business kind of courting over a period of time to just improve our success rate.", "Mark A. Moskowitz - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up, if I could. Can you help us, Kathy, understand for 2014 in terms of EPS guidance, how much is predicated on the increase in offshore in -- of labor within the Services business? Is that a big part of EPS in terms of the support or a backstop or is that more for 2015?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Certainly over the course of the year, we expect overall, looking at our labor costs as a percent of revenue, to give us a fair amount of help in EPS. A piece of that is clearly moving our footprint more towards low-cost centers. But another piece of that is just getting more productive and more efficient. And we do that both by literally shifting work into low-cost countries and also through attrition, just hiring up in low-cost countries and trying to shift that without necessarily incurring restructuring charges. So for sure, it's meaningful, but it is not the only piece that we're focused on in terms of getting our labor costs down.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. I have 2 questions actually on the Technology segment. Could you give me -- give a bit more color on the developing markets comments you made earlier? And given the volatility we're seeing in some of these regions, can you comment on whether or not we should think about just adding any material lift to the stabilization process we've seen in the Tech segment as we progress to 2014?", "Ursula M. Burns", "I would say not material and not continuous. We have a long history in developing economies in general. That history shows us that it does come and go. The good news is that we have a big base of business in many different areas around the developing economies, you know them all. This quarter, second half of this year, this has been pressured in Russia and Eastern Europe. Our fundamentals are good there and we're not losing share. We're participating in a fairly [indiscernible] where as the economies start to improve, we expect -- or the regulations start to improve or whatever drives the changes in Russia and Eastern Europe starts to improve, we'll participate, as we normally do, which is in a leadership way.", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "And the only other thing I'd say is DMO developing markets as a percent of total Tech revenue is not really high, call it between 12% and 13%. And we have a quite good history of managing profitability there when we see revenue decline.", "Bill C. Shope - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. And then my last question would be a bit more clarity on the supplies inventory situation. Was that -- I'm not sure if I misunderstood this. Was that primarily because of the DMO weakness or was that a broader-based inventory correction? And then, I guess, off of that, are you comfortable that you're fairly done with that process now?", "Kathryn A. Mikells", "Yes, so we're comfortable we're fairly done with that process. I mean, we were working towards it in the third quarter. And so in the fourth quarter, we had a bigger impact. It shows up in DMO and also in indirect channels, so that's where the inventory change takes place. And then DMO just, overall, was a little bit softer.", "Ursula M. Burns", "I think this is something that we initiated and it's, I think, it's is a good business practice for us to be on, given the volatility that we see in general and in the world. And so we just wanted to make sure that we didn't have a lot hung up through our partners. And so we made the decision to pull this back. And it definitely did impact the SMB segment and DMO, but I think it's a good business decision to make.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Bill. And that's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. And, Ursula, anything more to wrap up?", "Ursula M. Burns", "Yes, let me just wrap up with 2 points. Thanks for joining us today. It was good to hear from you. I said this earlier but I think it's worth repeating. We are focused on delivering on the strategies that we've outlined, which enable consistent earnings, expansion and really strong cash flow, cash that we are committed to deploying in a balanced way and enhance the shareholder value.", "James H. Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. And if you have any further questions, please contact me or any of our Investor Relations team. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

And welcome to the Xerox Corporation Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions)", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today we are reporting second quarter 2014 earnings that continued to reflect the benefits of our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow. We remain focused on our priorities and we are making progress.", "This quarter we saw a return to growth in Services and the business is well-positioned for sustained improvement. Services is now 57% of revenue and we are on track to reach our target of two-third by 2017. This important shift will drive overall revenue growth.", "Our Document Technology business drove strong profits again this quarter and continues to be an important for us, generating cash and profits above expectation. We continue our initiatives to improve Services profitability. We are seeing good profitability improvement especially within areas like document outsourcing, our commercial BPO business and ITO businesses, including healthcare and international services.", "We know that more need to be done especially in government healthcare, where we continue to stand-up a new Medicaid platform and deal with a couple of challenging contracts. So this remains a top priority.", "And of course, both segments, Services and Technology we remained focused on our important stakeholder with the keen attention on supporting our customers, delivering value for our investors and making Xerox a great place to work for our people.", "In the quarter we invested $227 million in acquisitions. Welcoming into Xerox the employees and customers of Smart Data Consulting and ISG Holdings. ISG is a leading provider of workers compensation software in the U.S.", "This acquisition will expand our significant present in the healthcare payor and insurance BPO markets, and we continue to invest organically in areas where we see good market opportunity, such as in private health exchanges, we have a differentiated offering for large employers through Buck Consultants at Xerox.", "We have a business that delivers strong cash flow. This gives us flexibility to not only invest for growth, but also build short and long-term shareholder value through a balanced approach to capital allocation that includes share repurchases and dividends.", "To execute on our direction, we have a strong team. Jeff Jacobson was recently named the President of our Document Technology business, taking over from Armando Zagalo de Lima, who is retiring after 31 years at Xerox.", "I want to thank Armando for everything that he has done for Xerox. He has put our document technology business on a solid foundation by transforming the organization to be more customer-focused, profitable and well-positioned to adapt to changes in the market.", "Here to look our results and my perspective. As I mentioned earlier, there are bright spots and positive trends, but we still have work -- more work to do. We reported adjusted EPS of $0.27, which is at the high-end of the range that we said.", "In the quarter we saw improvement in Services revenue growth. Services revenue was up 2%, that\u2019s up from flat growth last quarter and the business is trending well.", "Document Technology revenue had higher declines in the quarter as expected given timing of last year\u2019s product launches. It is in the range of expectations for the first half and we are very excited about upcoming product launches.", "Our operating margin is up year-over-year, driven by strong margins in Document Technology, the result of continue good operational discipline and focused on productivity.", "As anticipated, though, we did see margin decline in Services, due to the pressures that we are experiencing in government healthcare. We took a non-cash charge in the quarter and are making progress transitioning out of some challenging contracts. Kathy will provide you with more details in a few minutes.", "We are continuing our activities to create shareholder value, using our strong cash flow, which is up over $150 million for the first half to repurchase shares at a steady pace, supporting a growing dividend and acquiring companies that enhance our Services capability.", "We have a talented and dedicated team and we are keeping our stakeholders at the center of all that we do. Our goal is to provide excellent product and services, and deliver the operational results that are expected of us.", "With that, I will turn it over to Kathy. Then I will wrap up and we will open the call to your questions. Kathy?", "Kathy Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. Overall, we feel about our sequential program with the number of the themes from quarter one carrying through to quarter two. We continue to show operating profit growth, driven by strong margin expansion in Document Technology and we had good operational performance in the majority of our Services businesses.", "As expected, the government healthcare business continues to pressure Services margin, as we invest in rolling out our Medicaid platform. Additionally, we took incremental non-cash impairment charges, driven by the transition out of the Nevada Health Insurance Exchange. I will cover all of these dynamics in much greater detail when I review segment performance.", "First, I'd like to begin by walking through our earnings. Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at actual currency and down 2.5% in constant currency. Segment revenue trends were as expected, with Services revenue growth improving and Document Technology weaker as we face a challenging year-over-year compare due to last year\u2019s product launch timing.", "Gross margin of 30.8% was down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by the Services margin decline, as well as the greater mix of Services. We again saw a significant improvement in both SAG and RD&E as we benefit from productivity initiative, as well as lower pension expense.", "These improvements more than offset below our gross margin and resulted in operating margin expansion of 30 basis points year-over-year and 110 basis points sequentially, and enabled higher operating profit year-over-year.", "Moving down to income statement, adjusted other net was $14 million higher year-over-year. The increase was split between OID, which was $9 million higher year-over-year, reflecting a real estate gain in the prior year and restructuring which is $38 million was $5 million higher year-over-year and in line with our guidance.", "Adjusted tax rate of 27.7% was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and just above our guidance range of 25% to 27%. So, overall, there was a modest year-over-year headwind below operating profit. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was flat year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.27.", "Looking at the first half, adjusted EPS of $0.54 was also flat year-over-year, operating profit grew 6% in the first half, despite the pressure we are seeing in our government healthcare business and when combined with lower share count more than offset higher restructuring costs, OID and a higher tax rate. So, all in all, I believe we are making progress, obviously, with more work yet to do.", "With that, I will move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue growth once again improved sequentially and was up year-over-year 2% or 1% in constant currency, driven by a pick up in BPO which went from down 2% in Q1, so up 1% in Q2.", "Good growth in commercial healthcare and internationally, and better inorganic contribution was partially offset by a negative 1 point impact from the continued June loan run-off, as well as headwinds from lower customer care volume. Trends in document outsourcing up 3% and ITO up 1% were largely consistent with prior period.", "Turning to signings, signings were lower year-over-year especially renewal. The combination of a low renewal rate that was below target due to the Texas Medicaid law and the lower overall renewal opportunity resulted in renewal signings contract value down more than 35% in the quarter.", "New business signs were better story, up double-digit sequentially, but down 4% year-over-year and flat on a trailing 12-month basis. It should be noted that we did see some contract shift to the second half and we had a couple of large contract awards that won\u2019t be close until later this year.", "New York Medicaid, for instance, is not in these numbers. Our new business pipeline remains healthy, up 4% year-over-year and we expect better signings result in the second half. Shifting the profitability, segment margin was 8.6% in the second quarter which was flat sequentially and down 160 basis points year-over-year.", "A year-over-year decline was expected but we\u2019re below our guidance of sequential margin improvement. The miss was due solely to the impairment charges we took in the quarter associated with our health insurance exchange platform including non-cash charges related to the Nevada contract.", "We didn\u2019t formally adjust out the $20 million net impairment charges, but if we exclude it, our segment margin would be 9.2%, which is in line with our expectation for continued sequential improvement.", "So, we\u2019re beginning to get closure on our Nevada HIX contract and will be working with the state to continue to support the 2014 annual release and comply with their decisions to transition to the federal exchange for the next year's open enrollment.", "Turning to our Medicaid business, the second quarter performance was largely in line with our expectation as we continue to incur higher cost associated with launching our Medicaid platform and getting it to operational maturity. We\u2019re making progress. We had positive references and we\u2019re winning new business in the market. This is an area where we expect lower margins in the intermediate term as we drive improvements in our other implementation.", "Within the rest of services, we\u2019re seeing improved performance. I was very pleased with our margin performance in areas like commercial healthcare, document outsourcing and IPO. So our five-plank strategy and cost initiatives are driving improvements in many parts of the business and should continue to ramp as we move through the second half of the year.", "Turning to Services guidance. On revenue, second half growth will be negatively impacted by the losses of the Texas Medicaid contract, which is worth roughly 1.5 points of revenue growth. The rest of BPO improved and will also benefit by greater in organic contribution. We now expect to exit the year with a lower single-digit growth rate.", "On margin, our expectations are largely intact. We expect sequential improvement through the year putting aside non-cash impairment charges. The third quarter should coming in above 9.2% and we expect to exit the year comfortably above 10%. In terms of full year Services margin, we expect to come in at the lower end of the 9.4% to 9.8% range, reflecting the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter.", "I\u2019ll now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% at actual currency and 7% at constant currency. This was higher than last quarter's rate of decline and as we highlighted during our first quarter earnings call, this was anticipated given the timing of last year's product launches. That impact drove the higher rate of decline for equipment revenue with annuity revenue showing a consistent 4% decline in both quarters.", "Looking at the first half, Document Technology revenue was down 5% or 6% at constant currency, which is in line with expectations from mid-single digit decline and includes an approximate one point negative impact associated with our previous finance receivable transactions.", "From a geographic perspective, trends were generally consistent with our last quarter with the U.S stable, Europe improving and developing markets still weak. Looking at our product group, activity levels were lower as we save the challenging ConnectKey compare and some large wins in the prior year on graphic communications.", "In addition, the timing of this year's product launches are more back half weighted, which we believe will position us well later in the second half and into 2015. Planned launches include the recently announced Versant's entry production color product, extension of our ConnectKey platform within our mid range portfolio and into entry as well as a refresh of the number of entry desktop product.", "Document Technology margin in the quarter was 14.4%, which was 360 basis points higher year-over-year and continues to run above our long-term expectations. Our strong profit performance reflects ongoing benefits from restructuring and cost initiatives.", "In addition, transaction currency and lower pension expenses boosted our performance by 200 basis points. This quarter we also experienced more favorable mix and lower pricing impact. The strong margin performance resulted in operating profit growth of 25% despite a revenue decline. So overall it was a good quarter for Document Technology.", "Looking towards the third quarter, we continue to expect Document Technology to have revenue down mid-single digit with good margins although below the first half as we invest in the launch of new products that I mentioned earlier and also expect to have a less favorable impact from mix and some of other variable factors.", "With that, let\u2019s turn to the cash flow. Cash flow from operations was strong at $325 million in the quarter following a good Q1 results. Through the first half, cash from operations was $611 million, which was $165 million higher year-over-year.", "Underlying cash flow which excludes the impact from prior year finance receivable sales was $437 million in the second quarter and $846 million for the first half. It should be noted that the timing of operating cash flow generation was more balanced between Q1 and Q2 for the first half of this year versus last. And we're continuing to work to smooth out our working capital flows.", "The drivers of the higher year-over-year first half cash flow improvement include lower uses of cash for accounts receivable and inventory and higher cash earning. Partially, offsetting this positive is less contribution of cash flows from finance receivable, which reflects the negative impact of the prior-year finance receivable sales.", "Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were $326 million used in the quarter. We spent $123 million on CapEx and $227 million on acquisition. We closed in May on ISG, which complements Xerox\u2019s current business with the top 20 U.S. property, casualty and commercial health insurance company.", "The acquisition pipeline continues to look good and our full year expectation to spend up to $500 million in 2014 is unchanged. Consistent with our portfolio management strategy, this quarter we divested truck load management solutions, a small non-core business within services transportation.", "Cash from financing with the use of $561 million in the quarter and included $299 million in net debt payment, $204 million in share repurchased, and $79 million in preferred and common stock dividends. Ramping up cash flow we had a good first half and our full year guidance remain at $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion of operating cash flow, with the more event distribution through the year.", "Second half cash flow will be down year-over-year as the prior year included $384 million in proceeds from finance receivable sales in the third quarter and $270 million and $247 million in proceeds in the fourth quarter with no sales activities planned in 2014. That said second half underlying cash flow should be more consistent on a year-over-year basis.", "Now I\u2019ll walk through capital structure. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion in debt and in line with our original guidance, we continue to expect to end the year with about 7.8 billion in total debt. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.4 billion, leaving core debt of $3.3 billion.", "We managed our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment grade rating. Our financing debt has come down the past few years, driven by the finance receivable transactions as well as lower origination. So we feel good about our stable capital structure and if we move through the next slide, I\u2019ll review where we\u2019re at on share repurchases and dividends.", "With a strong first half cash flow performance and relatively high beginning of the year cash position, we\u2019ve been able to steadily repurchase shares during the first half for a total of $480 million or 42 million shares. We continue to view our shares as a good investment and anticipate doing at least $700 million in share repurchases for the year.", "Our full year guidance for dividend payments remains $300 million in 2014 and reflects our current quarterly dividend of $6.25 per share. When combined with the share repurchases, we expect at least a $1 billion to be returned to shareholders this year.", "Before I turn it back to Ursula, I just like to summarize our expectations for the third quarter and the full year.", "We were once again pleased with the performance of Document Technology and for the third quarter we expect margins to be at the high end of our target range with mid-single digit revenue declines. Given the strong first half profit performance, we expect full year margins to be at least a point above our target range of 9% to 11%, and up a similar level year-over-year.", "Within Services, we expect to make may further gains in the second half. The Texas Medicaid contract loss temporarily flows sequential revenue growth improvement and results in an exit revenue growth rate for Services in the low single digits. We feel good about delivering sequential margin improvement and exiting the year comfortably above 10%. And as I mentioned earlier, we expect full year Services margin to be at the lower end of our 9.4% to 9.8% range as a result of the non-cash charges that we took in the second quarter.", "At consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue to decline about two point and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 to $0.27, which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year, we\u2019re narrowing our adjusted EPS guidance range to $1.09.to $1.13.", "And with that, I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions. So I\u2019ll summarize quickly. Our second quarter shows progress, growing revenue in our Services business, operating profit in our technology business, and reaping the benefits of our strong cash flow. Our profits in Document Technology help offset the headwinds that we\u2019re seeing in some of our Services businesses.", "Our focus on implementing the Services strategy is showing positive results, and we are seeing good progress internationally and in areas like document outsourcing and commercial healthcare. Our strong cash flow allows us the flexibility to make strategic investments that will enhance opportunities in the future. Our 2014 priorities and focus are consistent.", "In Services, improving growth through portfolio management and profitability by driving cost efficiencies through the business. In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership positions in the industry while maintaining strong profitability. And we\u2019ll continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn you over to Jim.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today are Bob Zapfel, head of our services and Jeff Jacobson, head of our Document Technology business. Also let me point out that we had several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.", "For the Q&A, I ask participants to please limit follow-on and multipart questions, so we can get to everyone today. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instruction) Our first question comes from the line Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.", "Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. And thank you for taking my questions. Maybe start off with a question for Bob, so you had some nice sequential margin improvement, ex the restructuring or ex charge-off, it was 9.2% over 8.6% last quarter. What kind of -- I guess, the first part of the question is what kind of milestones do you need to hurdle for the remainder of the year, exit the year at a 10% or better than 10% margin run rate? And then I have a follow-up?", "Bob Zapfel", "Brian, thanks. I would appreciate that we did make -- we did make progress. I think we\u2019ve got a good clear game plan relative to cost management. We\u2019ve moved to a capability centered organization which has allowed us to look at our businesses and where we have a chance to leverage some cost advantages or cost businesses.", "So I wouldn\u2019t view it necessarily as some key milestones and jump over it. It\u2019s really more executing our overall plan. And I think we\u2019ve got a very clear line of sight to the track that Kathy laid out that gets us to comfortably at 10% plus as we exit the year.", "Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. And I understand, when we had the call last quarter, you had only been there for about 21 days. Since then I imagine you have the opportunity to peek under the covers to a little bit greater extent. If you look at the guidance prior quarter of exiting the year better than a 10% run rate, have you been able to identify additional low-hanging fruit and is that going for -- I guess, along the lines of cost improvements or operational improvements. And would that potentially lead to upside to that number and then going into 2015, do we expect sequential improvement again through the year or there is certain factors that could lead to additional lumpiness in margin performance in 2015?", "Bob Zapfel", "Well, we\u2019ll be more in 2015 at the Investor Day session in November. But again, I would say our track through year end, we\u2019ve got a pretty clear line of -- I wouldn't call it low-hanging fruit. But I would say that -- it never feels that way when you\u2019re operating the business. But I would say we\u2019ve got a very, very clear plan that is broadly owned by the team. And some of this is, that news that we\u2019ve had that\u2019s affected our margin. So it won\u2019t repeat.", "So we get a little better lift in the second half versus the first half because of some of the challenges that we specifically called out. But we\u2019ve got a good solid operating plan to deliver those kind of margin as we exit the year. And we certainly are looking -- we certainly are looking at next year as though now we want to fall back in the wrong direction. But we\u2019ll get more detail on the 2015 roadmap when we\u2019re together for the investor session in November.", "Ursula Burns", "Brian, if you think about -- this is Ursula, all the business lines that Bob manages and he has been leading into in the last couple of months, we manage all of them to try to show us margin expansion on a business-by-business basis. And in the second quarter, we saw that and we expect and literally the plan is to continue to drive those actions through the business so that we see the same kind of margin expansion in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter.", "So just reiterating what you said, there is no miracle here. It is literally just operating the business on a line-by-line basis and getting better control over government help, which I think we have the foundation for it today.", "Brian Essex - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks.", "Ursula Burns", "We can have the next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes from Barclays.", "Ben Reitzes - Barclays", "Hi. I just want to kind of go on to the margin question a little more and ask about the two segments as we go throughout the year and maybe a little bit of a different way. In services, you mentioned renewals down quite a bit and the bookings look like they are below your expectations. So I wanted to just -- I was under the impression renewals, you probably have higher margin than new business.", "And in light of that, just how that plays out on the margin line with you guys getting above your -- above 10%. And then on the technology side, I just want to know, you guys talked about margin coming down from 14.4, just how abruptly like does it stabilized in the 12-ish type range because the upside there was about $0.05 in the quarter on that technology margin that was quite staggering. So I just want to see how much that comes back in and why. So it's just a little more detail in both margins in the big segments?", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. So Ben, I\u2019ll start with just talking about overall kind of booking and how we see bookings impacting our margins. If we look forward to the second half, clearly we\u2019re expecting bookings to improve in the second half fiscals because they\u2019ve got bigger renewal opportunity as well as additional new bookings expected on top of that.", "In terms of renewals versus new-- we wouldn\u2019t expect to see a negative mix implication overall. We always anticipate adding renewals, we have price downs. We\u2019re anticipating that overall and so we don't see any negative mix. And overall if you look at how the mix of the portfolio is changing. Out ITO growth has slowed a little bit. BPO growth is picking up. That\u2019s generally a positive for us on mix overall.", "If I flip to the second part of your question which was really about technology margin, if we look at what happened in this quarter, I\u2019d say, three months ago, we underestimated the level of pension improvement we were going to get. We got a little bit more currency improvement and overall mix turned out to be more favorable and we had a little less pricing pressure than we would typically see.", "If I go to talk about that in second half, our expectations for our technology margins, we\u2019ll see a dip in the third quarter because we\u2019ve got a lot of new product launches and so that\u2019s mainly the impact there. We don\u2019t get quite as much pension benefit in the third quarter. So pension benefits are a little bit lumpy for us because we have pension settlement cost.", "But overall if you look at the second half and certainly the guidance we gave for the full year, at least 100 basis points above the high end of our 9% to 11% range, I feel really good about technology margins but I feel great about our ability to continue to well-manage this business to produce very strong profit and very strong cash flow.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks Ben. If we could move to the next question please?", "Operator", "Certainly, our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Thank you very much. Jeff, I had a question for you. Could you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the printing market? I mean, you\u2019ve got rollout of significantly more product in the second half of this year. Do you expect market share gains? What markets are you sort of focused on and if you can give any color in terms of geography because it seems like Europe was pretty strong? And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.", "Jeff Jacobson", "Sure. Shannon. So let me just say in terms of our activity, our activity has been strong for the past year and we gained a share point in 2013. And in Q1 and as Kathy said we knew we would have a tough Q2 compare, due to ConnectKey, our entry production color high launch. However Kathy mentioned our product launch is coming in the second half, which I think will really start seeing more of a benefit in Q4 and certainly into 2015 where we have about 20 new launches in the second half.", "We\u2019re benefiting entire company but I think it will especially benefit our developing markets, our channels organization and certainly document outsourcing. And I think it\u2019s also important to mention that even in this quarter where we had a tough compare in our median high segments, we had sequential growth in both color and mono, and in entry, we were essentially flat in color.", "Ursula Burns", "Let me take some of the geographies. We\u2019re seeing pretty stable business environment in the U.S., very predictable for us. We manage it well. And so you were right -- Europe, last quarter, we saw improvement. This quarter, Europe is hanging in there for us and doing well. Developing market continues to be a precious place for us.", "My expectation is that U.S. and Europe will continue to trend that they are on and unfortunately developing economies will continue to trend that they want to be. It would be tough for us. The product launch that Jeff talked about should help us, giving them more optionality to sell and deal. But it\u2019s not clear that the environment they will actually pick it all up.", "Shannon Cross - Cross Research", "Okay. Great and then just my follow-up question for Bob or Ursula, I'm not sure which. When you think about New York State in the contract that you've -- I know it's not finalized, but it appears you're going to be awarded. How do we think about that in light of some of the startup costs that we saw with California Medi-Cal? I mean, is this something where you're going to be able to leverage some of your newer platforms, so perhaps not as many startup costs or just how do we sort of think about that as we look through the year?", "Ursula Burns", "Bob will take it.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah, Shannon, I think the way to think about New York is obviously first we have to -- we have to move from award to contracts. So we are excited for the opportunity to do that after the protest cycle and our view would be we\u2019ve really learned a lot through the prior implementations. We think that we will be able to execute New York well for the citizens in the state and for us. It won\u2019t be, all of these new implementations start with not huge margins. You make your money over time, but that\u2019s the way we built it into all of our guidance. So, that\u2019s plan for us. We understand we don\u2019t expect to have big unrecovered costs, but we do know that they don\u2019t start at higher margin that that\u2019s the business model designed. It\u2019s not unique to any individual state that services broadly and that\u2019s part of what we\u2019ve accounted for in our commitments as we go forward.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Thank you. And congratulations to you and your team there at Xerox. If we\u2019re to look at several of the metrics such as signings and bookings and margins -- and I am looking more forward-looking. Should we then expect them to no longer come up? Or given the timing of when the decisions were made from Texas, Nevada, California, and New York that there might be some impact to those? And I think that maybe help us filter through the magnitude of what we should expect.", "Kathy Mikells", "So on signing, the loss of Texas is basically behind us. It was reflected overall in our renewal rate. What we\u2019re expecting going forward as we talked about signings improvements in the second half and so New York isn\u2019t included in our numbers today, but we would expect to see that in the future. We have another award, that\u2019s under protest for a tolling deal that we did in Florida, again not included in our numbers, part of the reason why we have a good amount optimism in the second half. So overall, we feel good about looking forward in signings improvements in the second half.", "Ursula Burns", "And our renewal rate without the Texas loss would be in the range that we wanted to be in the 85% to 90% range. So the Texas loss is a singular event, but our business flows are fairly consistent with all the quarters previously, particular on renewals.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Okay. And then as a quick follow-up, when we think about there has been a lot of public information about the New York contract and the California contract. When those are ramping, are those fully considered in your margin profile outlook, or are you building in a little additional stand-up costs? I at least want to make sure that we're just not then going to be seeing some additional pressure from those ramping.", "Kathy Mikells", "Both of those are fully contemplated in the guidance.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup", "Great. That\u2019s good to hear. Thank you and congratulations again.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Jim. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I will just start out with Kathy. Could you provide the impact or expected impact on the various government healthcare contracts you have rolling on and off over the next several quarters? Specifically, what the timing is for when New York MMIS will come online and whether the expected impact for Texas MMIS will be a very consistent 150 basis points year-over-year? Then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "And so take New York first. New York is a little bit hard to call perfectly right is we are going to a protest period and we then have to contract. Our expectation would be that we start to see a little bit of New York coming on towards the tail end of this year, but it has a more material impact in 2015. And then with respect to Texas, Texas is going to tail off pretty quickly. And so we have a little bit of transition in Texas, but we expect to see Texas tail off pretty fast.", "Bob Zapfel", "Kathy, if I could add, so that 150 basis points on the top line, we would be dealing with that if you will for roughly for a quarter. So, that is it will hit us to start. As Kathy has mentioned, as we kind of go through the third and fourth quarters. And then on a quarter year-over-year basis we would be looking at that still in the first half of next year as well.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And lastly, Ursula and Bob, could you share color on how the other parts of the services business is performing, so commercial BPO, commercial ITO and document outsourcing?", "Ursula Burns", "I will start at the highest level. Let\u2019s say I am pleased with all of them and let me let Bob go into a little bit more color.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah, I would say we really had -- we\u2019ve got the challenge obviously what we talked about in government healthcare, but if you look at the rest of the portfolio, our business in Europe was up double digits organically, even more sizably with the benefit of an acquisition earlier in the year. Our commercial healthcare business is growing at double-digit rates with very strong margins. Our HR and learning business is performing very well for the most part the mix. I mean not everybody is perfect, but the mix across the rest of those businesses in aggregate we are very pleased with.", "Ursula Burns", "And one -- if I can add one point on ITO, very specifically, our revenue growth in ITO is half for the last few quarters, last two quarters at least slowed to low-single digits and we spoke about this in last year\u2019s Investor Conference, and I am sure in some calls before about how we look at our ITO business. It\u2019s a good business for us. It is a relatively small business for us and it operates at the lower end of our margin range. And so we are focusing on margin expansion, an improvement in ITO and not so much on revenue growth there. We are putting most our bullets or guns in the -- bullets in the gun around BPO and document outsourcing from a revenue growth perspective and that will continue.", "Bob Zapfel", "And that\u2019s part of the portfolio mix strategy that the team covered last November at the Investor meeting. So that\u2019s part of our five-plank strategy is really around trying to grow more rapidly in our most 'advantage' businesses. And Ursula\u2019s comments are right to that point.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, George. If we could have our next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Hi. Thank you, guys. I have two questions as well. The first is philosophical growth rate. And what I mean by that is, Bob, I was hoping you could address BPO and ITO. And the recent data points around BPO have been very mixed. A lot of your competitors and even some of the leading consulting organizations have suggested that the BPO market has indeed slowed. Now Xerox is in a slightly different segment or at least a slightly different segment than some of the leading organizations, but I was hoping you could address on the market level if you are seeing a slowdown in BPO? Related to that is the ITO side. Ursula just mentioned, your strategy is different, which I think is completely appropriate, but can you grow the ITO side, or does that become a negative growth rate as you look out? And then I have a follow-on question on margins, please.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah, I would say on the BPO market, we are in the middle of our strategy cycle. We see that market, obviously it\u2019s a broad $200 billion plus market. It breaks into horizontal, multi-industry components and industry-specific components. Overall, we see it at mid-single-digits and there is a little bit different mix depending on what area, but it\u2019s a very attractive market from our standpoint. And I would view it as a more favorable from a market dynamic standpoint, more favorable than ITO which is -- it was earlier in the maturity cycle, grew to be a very large market more rapidly. So we still feel very good. Obviously segment by segment, we look at each of them, but if you just macro to BPO broadly, we see mid-single-digit growth through the strategic horizon in that business area.", "Keith Bachman - BMO Capital Markets", "Okay. Well, I will transition to my second question. Although, Bob, I'd love you to come back on and say can ITO grow or does it go negative? But my second question is for you, Ursula, as well as for Bob. You do seem to be doing well in the commercial side of your services business, which the healthcare or government side, more specifically the government side of healthcare continues to struggle, why not deemphasize that business? Nobody makes any money who serves the healthcare industry in the government side, it doesn't seem. CSC has been pretty vocal that they did not follow up with a bid for the New York side because they didn't think they would make money in it. So just philosophically, why not focus more on the commercial side and deemphasize the government healthcare related activities and thereby improve your sustainable profit levels?", "Ursula Burns", "I don\u2019t think that we are not focused more or focused a lot on the commercial side we are, but we also -- the government healthcare market is a very attractive market. We went through one cycle when this market started many, many years ago that shows that we could invest in a new platform, stay in that platform up and have it last for many, many years and continue to drive growth on topline and profitability on the bottomline. That is -- that remains our expectation.", "And if you look at some of the contracts that are more mature, moving towards more maturity, California, for example, we have been able to literally move that contract from investment phase to flat profitability now to looking for growing profitability in a very predictable kind of a standard way, took a little bit longer but on a go forward basis California is going to be beautiful. And we expect as we implement New York to be beautiful as well. So we\u2019re not deemphasizing commercial in favor of government, not at all. We\u2019re focused on all of them at a demographic show that we should be focused on them as well.", "Bob Zapfel", "If I could just add one point a color, we\u2019re above 10% operating margins and the majority of roughly 70% of our government healthcare business. So our experience, I can\u2019t speak to the competitor, but our experience is once you get this stabilized, you can have a great value proposition for the client and good for the shareowners. And one of client just yesterday came out and reference that we\u2019ve been working through some issues, but they expect the system to have a 20 year longevity. So, that\u2019s the reason that we don\u2019t view it as an area to exit or deemphasize.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Keith. If we can move on to next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan", "Great. Thanks for sharing that commercial margin in the size. I didn't realize how big it was. Actually I just wanted to ask first about signings and the outlook for the second half. Can you be more specific there? Can you get to a book-to-bill north of say 1 in the second half without New York?", "Kathy Mikells", "Yes. So I\u2019ll get a little more specific. When we look at the second half, we\u2019re expecting improvements and we think roughly we should end the year flattish on a 12-month trailing basis. So we clearly have expectations make up for some of the softness in the first half.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan", "Understood. And then just my follow-up, the outlook on Document Technology margins, same question there, maybe you can be a little more specific. It sounds like you could stay above your target range in the second half. You called out the 2 points around pension and transaction effects, but it feels like with some of the changes, is it possible we can assume that your longer-term margin target 9% to 11% could be elevated given some of the -- given the run rate?", "Kathy Mikells", "So I\u2019m going to put aside sort to 2015 and long term, but if you just look at the second half, we guided specifically to being at call it the high end of that 9% to 11% target range for the third quarter. We typically are a fourth quarter stronger just from a seasonality perspective in the technology business.", "And if you look at some of the kind of year-over-year things that are going on, one of the things we had last year where these receivable sales or financing receivable sales. And so year-over-year we have a little less headwind in the fourth quarter from that than we do in the third quarter. So we would expect seasonally better performance in the fourth quarter there.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan", "Yeah. Now it seems like it\u2019s in a good place, that\u2019s why I asked. Thank you.", "Kathy Mikells", "Great.", "Jim Lesko", "Thank you, Tien-tsin. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Certainly, our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah - Brean Capital", "Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Two if I could. The first is on services rev growth. Bob, can you just kind of walk through what -- given that there has been some choppiness this year in both revenue growth and in signing, can you give us a sense of what the headwinds are going into 2015? And how we should think about those kind of layering in and falling off as we exit the year?", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah. I guess from a headwind standpoint, we\u2019re still have the student loan runoff, that\u2019s more of a factor in the second half of the year, the next year. Texas will be a headwind as we\u2019ve talked about more in the first half of next year than as we exit the year. We\u2019ve got -- as we\u2019ve referenced, we\u2019ve got some substantial contract award potential for us as we close out this year that will then lead to filling in some of those gaps.", "And we view the market, as I briefly said earlier at a mid-single-digit growth rate and we think that we can get roughly that range as part of our overall sales strategy. So there are a few headwinds, they are not unknown headwinds though. And we\u2019ve got a team that wants to be successful on the marketplace and that\u2019s our focus.", "Ursula Burns", "If I can just put an umbrella on top of that, so BPO, Bob has talked about it, I have mentioned it, higher growth rates, document outsourcing higher growth rate. The part of the market that we are, that we\u2019ll continue to have a low growth rate for us is the ITO business, that is not something that the market should panic on, that is literally the strategy.", "One actually focus on profitability there, be very selective with our contract plans and we\u2019re doing that. Our renewals and our renewal rate continues to be strong. Loss of 85%, we continue to have that as an expectation. Decisions are slow, a little bit -- well they were little bit slower in the second quarter. A lot of them have moved to the third quarter and fourth and we expect to sign the ones that coming up then. We have a very good win rate on new business there, the 10 or so that we were pursuing in the quarter.", "We lost two and signed eight. We expect to have that kind of a flow going forward. So I think that the revenue portion of the picture, there are puts and takes and there are of course some ups and down, Texas down, etcetera, etcetera. But I think on a macro basis, it looks good.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Ananda. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.", "Bill Shope - Goldman Sachs", "Okay. Thank you. So my first question is on services. So you have the Nevada issue out of the way, which obviously gives you room for improvement into the back half. But given some of the other contract challenges you've had and some of the unexpected challenges in recent months, is there a risk that we could see further write-downs in the second half or do you feel like the model is pretty fully scrubbed at this point?", "And then my second question, a broader question would be on your restructuring plans, how is it going relative to your original targets? And as you refine the services strategy, are you finding any new opportunities arising in the restructuring category? That\u2019s it for me.", "Kathy Mikells", "So overall on the first piece, the impairment charges that we took in the quarter were associated with our state (indiscernible) platform, right? And we basically completely cleansed our balance sheet with regard to that. As you look then at our Medicaid platform, I mean, we\u2019re winning new business in the marketplace. So, we don\u2019t really see any issue there in terms of some future shoe to drop type of thing.", "Overall, I\u2019d also mention in this quarter that we settled with another state in terms of just our execution plan associated with their implementation and more specifics around the design and functionality. And so that\u2019s another one that I\u2019d say, we really kind of tucked away in this quarter. So we feel pretty good about our grip on what we need to do in order to continue to mature the implementations.", "And I would say kind of kudos to the Government Health Solutions group in terms of pretty well predicting outside of the impairment charge. What we\u2019re going to see in this quarter which is why when I exclude the impairment charge, we\u2019ve really had the profitability in margin progression that we were expecting.", "On the second question on restructuring, we\u2019ve been very consistent about restructuring. I\u2019d expect to continue to see about $0.02 a quarter at the very beginning of the year. We said, we expect that restructuring charges to be pretty similar year-over-year and I think we did about a $115 million in total in restructuring charges last year. So maybe we would be a tad higher this year, but we\u2019re going to continue to be pretty consistent in our overall approach to restructuring.", "Ursula Burns", "And one of the things that we talked about in this infamous or famous five-plank strategy, one of the major things we talked about was cost improvement in services. So we have a lot of focus on restructuring in the technology business and have a good reason there. And Bob is developing that same level of discipline and rhythm in the services business, so I expect the restructuring to participate and drive margin expansion, portion of the margin expansion that Bob is counting on and continue to be strong margin contributors in the technology business as well.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Bill. And operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Certainly, our final question for today comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna", "Hi. Thanks for sneaking me in and I'll ask my two upfront. First for Ursula, second for Kathy. Ursula, when you look across the services portfolio, which do you emphasize more, is it revenue growth or margins? And then, Kathy, I'll just ask you upfront, could you share some color on the margin characteristics of ISG and Smart Data? And are there other dispositions, meaning asset sales that you have planned in the second half? Thank you.", "Ursula Burns", "By the way your first question is a good question and unfortunately it doesn\u2019t have a singular answer. It depends on the section of the business and markets that we\u2019re speaking about. I just talked about ITO for example. And in ITO, I emphasized margin expansion over revenue growth. It doesn\u2019t mean I want them to walk away from good business that we can get and we can stand up in a margin expanding way, but I actually tell them more focus on margin than on revenue.", "In government healthcare, it\u2019s both. I want to make sure we do not lose any large contracts and in places like in MMIS where we have a platform go hard to what\u2019s growing that business, why would you expand margins. So it\u2019s a mix of discussions and it\u2019s different across the word transportation, revenue growth, etcetera.", "Our advantaged businesses revenue growth and our businesses that are not performing at the level that we want from a margin perspective, its margin on focus, so it\u2019s a mix of things. And the good news is that Bob can actually walk and chew gum at the same time. So he can actually manage too many different signals that I gave him.", "Kathy Mikells", "And then just on the second question, generally as we\u2019ve talked about one plank of our overall services strategy as it\u2019s just portfolio management and we\u2019re trying to improve the overall mix of our business, right. So as you look at the things that we\u2019re acquiring, they\u2019re very strategically aligned with that strategy. And I would say, ISG and Smart Data absolutely fall into that category. Smart Data gives us a little bit of added scale in the litigation space, litigation services, which is the great business for us, it\u2019s a high margin business. And ISG got added into our insurance overall portfolio and so again, looking to mix up and not looking to dilute margin.", "Jim Lesko", "Great. Thank you. That\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. We generally thank you for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap up.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Jim. And I\u2019m confident that we have the right strategy and the right team in place to deliver on that strategy. We\u2019re making progress and we have a lot of work to do to continue to create greater value for our employees, our customers and our shareholders and we are up to the challenge.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have any further questions, please contact me or any members from our Investor Relations team. Thank so much for joining us today.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude the program and you may now disconnect.

Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning and thanks for joining our call. Today we are reporting Q3 2014 earnings, and in addition to sharing our performance I\u2019ll update you on progress that we\u2019re making against our overall strategy and how we\u2019re positioning ourselves for the future.", "Overall our business model is healthy. We have the benefit of a strong annuity business, a diversified portfolio and healthy cash flow. We delivered earnings at the high end of our range and grew margin on a total Xerox basis. ", "We\u2019re making progress. We are the leader in diversified business services and we are maintaining leadership in our document technology business, and we\u2019re investing in both businesses for the future. So here are some specifics on the progress that we\u2019re making.", "We remain the leader in document technology and its strong profitability continues to help fuel our growth initiatives. We announced 17 new products during Q3 meeting market demand for continued innovation in this category. ", "We continue to strengthen our position in services. We\u2019re implementing a new operating model and client coverage strategy to improve signings performance and productivity. We continue to strengthen our leadership and apply talent to areas where we see the greatest market opportunity. ", "We\u2019re bringing greater value to our services clients with the use of advanced analytics that deliver insights gleaned from our delivery model. A good example is in Commercial Healthcare, which was a standout again this quarter. Here we recently launched Juvo, an advanced analytics platform that allows hospitals to analyze every aspect of the clinical cycle of care. ", "Our Document Outsourcing business is getting external recognition as well. Our three-tier managed print services strategy was called out by IDC for Innovative Leadership. The Xerox Merge system which uses data analytics to optimize parking demand and meter pricing was the winner of the 2014 Promising Innovation in Transport Award. So across both services and document technology we remain focused on our important stakeholders, delivering value for our investors, being the best partner to our clients, and making Xerox a great place to work for our people.", "Here\u2019s a look at our results and my perspective: we\u2019re reporting adjusted EPS of $0.27 which is at the high end of the range that we set. Our Document Technology business came in above expectations while Services margin results were lower than planned. ", "On the revenue side Services grew modestly and Document Technology declined in line with our expectations. Our operating margin is up year-over-year driven by strong margins in Document Technology. Services margins was up sequentially but lower than we anticipated as a result of higher cost in government healthcare as well as ongoing strategic investments. ", "And we continue to use our strong cash flow, almost $600 million in the quarter, to deliver value to stakeholders through dividends and share repurchases. We\u2019re raising full-year guidance for share repurchases to approximately $1 billion, and we are making disciplined acquisitions targeted at enhancing our Services capabilities. Most recently we acquired Consilience Software, Inc., a case management and workflow automation software provider for government agencies.", "We have a talented and dedicated team which we continue to strengthen. Our goal remains to provide leading products and services for our clients and deliver the operational results expected of us. With that I\u2019ll turn it over to Kathy, then I\u2019ll wrap up and we\u2019ll open the call to your questions. Kathy?", "Kathy Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. There were a number of plusses and minuses in the quarter but overall we delivered roughly in-line revenue and EPS at the high end of our range with strong cash flow. We took a bit of a different path to achieve that outcome with document technology profitability coming in stronger and offsetting lower services profitability. I\u2019ll cover both segment results as well as cash flow separately, but first let\u2019s walk through earnings.", "Revenue in the quarter was down 2% at both actual and constant currency. In total segment revenue trends were largely as expected, with Services up modestly and Document Technology down mid-single digits. Gross margin of 30.8% was down 70 basis points year-over-year, driven by a decline in Services as well as the greater mix of services at a lower margin.", "Our D&E was lower year-over-year as increases in Services were more than offset by productivity-driven reductions in Document Technology. SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower pension expense. These improvements more than offset the lower gross margin and resulted in operating margin expansion of 10 basis points year-over-year. Operating profit in total was roughly flat as margin expansion basically offset the impact of the revenue decline.", "Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was $29 million higher year-over-year. Within that, OID was $35 million higher, reflecting a real estate gain in the prior year as well as higher litigation reserves this year. Restructuring of $28 million was $7 million lower year-over-year and in line with our guidance. ", "Adjusted tax rate of 26.8% was one point lower year-over-year and at the high end of our guidance range of 25.0% to 27.0%. Adjusted EPS of $0.27 was $0.01 higher year-over-year as growth in Document Technology\u2019s operating profit roughly offset the decline in Services; and below the line, higher OID expense was more than offset by lower share count.", "I\u2019ll now move to Services Segment\u2019s slide to review our results in more detail. Services revenue grew 1% and was flat in constant currency, which was about a point lower sequentially reflecting the impact of the Texas Medicaid loss that we discussed last quarter. Within Services, BPO growth increased to 2% from 1% in Q2 with good growth in Commercial Healthcare, Litigation Services, and International.", "ITO declined 3% due to the impact of lower prior ITO signings as we\u2019ve become more selective in where we participate in that business, with our main focus on improving our margins and profit there. Document Outsourcing was flat year-over-year, with continued strong growth in our SMB offerings offset by lower equipment sales in enterprise. ", "We expect Services top line growth to remain constrained in Q4 as several large new deals that have been awarded are taking longer to get to contract, and some new businesses decisions that have been deferred are also delaying the ramp of new work. This is negatively impacting signings as well, which were down year-over-year.", "We had previously anticipated better signings results throughout the second half but are now seeing the shift to Q4 and early 2015 reflecting the decision and contracting delays. We have a strong pipeline up 7% year-over-year and are continuing to ramp up sales hiring and training. Renewal rate in the quarter was 82%, which was modestly below our target range of 85% to 90% driven by a lower ITO renewal rate. ", "The BPO renewal rate was above 90% in the quarter, albeit with less renewal opportunity. We have a large BPO contract renewal that\u2019s been awarded and is in the process of being contracted, so that should help our Q4 renewal rate and signings.", "Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 8.9% in Q3 which was up 30 basis points sequentially but fell short of our target to get something north of 9.2%. We did see solid sequential margin expansion in BPO even with adjusting out the government healthcare Nevada-Hicks impairment charge from last quarter.", "In Document Outsourcing, our margins are quite good but are seasonally lower in Q3; and in ITO we took a temporary hit in margin as we proactively restructured a few contracts, seeking to improve the mix and profitability of that business.", "Within Government Healthcare we\u2019re making good progress but expense levels are still high as we continue to invest to improve the performance of the first platform implementations of our new Medicaid platform. These impacts were more constrained ni Q3 but are still a headwind year-over-year.", "We\u2019ve been realigning the Services organization to better leverage our scale, gain efficiencies, and improve customer value. We\u2019re aligning the organization to specific industries to improve our go to market approach and have consolidated management of operational capabilities to achieve scale benefits. We believe this structure will also enable improved execution. We continue to bring in additional new talent under Bob\u2019s leadership and are focused on accelerating productivity gains and de-layering our old SBU management structure.", "In Q4 we expect further sequential margin improvement; however, we\u2019re moderating our expectations in light of our Q3 results and investments required as we push forward with our Services strategy. We expect margin to be between 9% and 10% for the quarter.", "With that I\u2019ll review Document Technology. Revenue in Document Technology was down 6% in actual and constant currency and was in line with expectations. Equipment revenue declines moderated versus Q2, and although annuity declines were a bit higher this was due entirely to the impact of finance receivables sales in the prior year which had a one point impact to revenue growth. From a geographic perspective trends were generally consistent with last quarter, with the US stable, Europe improving and developing markets weak but with moderating declines. ", "Looking at the product groups we\u2019re seeing very positive results in the high end, with growth in both equipment and annuity revenue. High-end annuity revenue grew the past two quarters which is encouraging as it reflects increases in [MIF] and pages in this important segment. Mid-range was in line with overall Document Technology declines while Entry Performance was weaker. ", "Q3 was a very strong quarter for new products with 17 products launched and an additional three launched in October. We extended our very successful ConnectKey platform into a number of entry multifunctional devices as well as into color and mono mid-range products. By further extending the platform we provide even more options for our customers looking to leverage our strong mobile, security, and app development. This should position us well in Q4 and as we enter 2015.", "Document Technology margin in the quarter was 14% resulting in operating profit growth of 9% despite the revenue decline. The strong margin performance reflects benefits from restructuring and cost initiatives as well as continued favorable mix, positive transaction currency, and lower pension expense. Although mix may not be as favorable in Q4 we expect continued strong margin performance, down sequentially but up year-over-year. ", "As we look to 2015 based on today\u2019s rates we\u2019d expect currency transaction benefits to continue. However, pension expense will be a significant headwind. Pension settlement expense this year is expected to come in even lower than we previously anticipated, declining about $100 million year-over-year. The further decline relates to changes in the discount rate used to determine benefits with the rate recently published for 2015 coming in lower than 2014.", "This naturally motivates individuals to wait to take their lump sum in 2015 when the benefit will be higher and will shift more cost for us into next year. This is the opposite phenomenon from what we experienced from 2013 to 2014 where the discount rate increased and it adds noncash volatility to our earnings. With the discount rate declining we expect about $105 million of additional noncash settlements expenses next year.", "Our Technology segment margins have been running well above our long-term guidance of 9% to 11%, and even with the pension headwind we expect we will be above the high end of the range again next year.", "I\u2019ll turn now to cash flow. Cash flow from operations was $595 million in the quarter and $1.2 billion through September. As expected cash flow in the quarter was lower than prior year due to the positive impact of $316 million last year from the finance receivables sales versus a net negative impact of $102 million this year due to the loss of collections from previous sales. Underlying cash flow, which excludes the impact from prior-year financed receivables sales, was $697 million in Q3 and $1.5 billion through September. ", "With cash from operations we continue to see the benefit from working capital, which included some timing benefits within accounts payable this quarter. So overall it was another strong operating cash flow quarter.", "Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $128 million use in the quarter. We spent $112 million on CAPEX and $25 million on acquisitions for the recently announced Consilience acquisition, a provider of case management and workflow automation software that\u2019ll strengthen Xerox\u2019s suite of offerings to state governments. ", "Additionally in Q3 we exited the Xerox Audio/Visual Solutions business, a small audio/visual business that was non-core and flowed into our other segment results. Cash from financing was a use of $417 million and included $251 million in share repurchases and $83 million in preferred and common stock dividends. ", "So to wrap up cash flow, with three quarters done we\u2019re well positioned to deliver on our full-year cash flow guidance of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion of operating cash flow, which equates to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion of free cash flow. And as a reminder we have no financed receivables sales planned in Q4 as compared to proceeds of $247 million in Q4 2013.", "Now I\u2019ll quickly cover capital structure. We ended the quarter with $7.7 billion in debt and in line with our original guidance we continue to expect to end the year with about $7.8 billion in total debt. Applying 7:1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt is $4.2 billion leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade credit rating, while financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by the financed receivables transactions as well as lower origination.", "So we have a pretty stable capital structure, and if we move to the next slide I\u2019ll review where we\u2019re at on share repurchases and dividends. With our strong cash flow to date and taking advantage of our high beginning-of-year cash position we\u2019ve steadily repurchased shares this year for a total of $730 million or 61 million shares through September. We continue to view our shares as a good investment and we\u2019re increasing our full-year share repurchases to approximately $1 billion.", "Our full-year guidance for dividend payments remains about $300 million and reflects our current quarterly dividend of $0.0625 per share. When combined with the share repurchases we now expect approximately $1.3 billion to be returned to shareholders this year.", "Before I turn it back to Ursula I\u2019d like to summarize our expectations for Q4 and the fully year. We expect Document Technology to continue to deliver strong margin, up year-over-year in Q4 but down sequentially driven by the new product launch timing and mix with full-year margin above 13%. Revenue declines remain down mid-single digits in constant currency, and down an additional two points in actual currency in Q4 given the recent strengthening of the dollar relative to the Euro.", "As I detailed earlier we\u2019re continuing our investments and improvement actions and services, and expect our Q4 margins to expand sequentially to approximately 9% to 10%, with revenue growth flat to up 1% with about a point of negative currency impact. At the consolidated level for Q4 we expect revenue will decline about three points, including one to two points of negative currency with adjusted earnings per share of $0.30 to $0.32 which includes about $0.02 of restructuring. And for the full year we now expect adjusted earnings per share of $1.11 to $1.13.", "As we look to 2015 our EPS expansion will be constrained due to the volatility of nonoperational pension settlement expenses that I discussed earlier. With that I\u2019ll hand it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions so I will summarize quickly.", "Our Q3 shows our strategy is on track but we still have areas for improvement. We\u2019re seeing the benefits of strong operating profit from Document Technology while we position our Services business for future growth. Our annuity-based operating model, diverse portfolio and strong cash flow combine for a healthy and resilient business model.", "We\u2019ll finish 2014 with a focus on three priorities: in Services improving growth and profit through portfolio management and improved productivity; in Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership position in the industry while maintaining strong profitability. And we\u2019ll continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.", "Thank you and now over to you, Jim.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, head of our Services business. Also let me point out that there\u2019s several supplemental slides at the end of our deck that provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. ", "For the Q&A I ask participants to please limit follow-on and multipart questions so that we can get to everyone, and at the end of our Q&A session I\u2019ll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator instructions.) Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Hi, good morning, thank you. I just wanted to first ask about the signings and the visibility there. What\u2019s driving the push out on the project ramps in the signings? Is it a cyclical issue or maybe are client priorities changing? Any color there would be great.", "Bob Zapfel", "Thanks Tien-tsin, this is Bob. I think you have to break it into big deals versus more traditional and I think on the big deals side of it we have seen an elongated process largely associated with, really with competitors protesting and those cycles running longer. So on the big deal components we\u2019re very happy with our success rate; they are taking longer to get to closure. ", "On the more traditional kind of volume of pursuits, our win rate remains very strong. In Q3 of the top 20 deals we were pursuing we didn\u2019t lose a single one, but our in-quarter conversion rate was lower than typical \u2013 and I would say that\u2019s a little bit of a function of there\u2019s more that we need to do and that we\u2019re investing in relative to our sales force and helping them get the larger deals, or those top 20 deals over the goal line. So hopefully that\u2019s responsive to your question.", "Tien-tsin Huang \u2013 JPMorgan ", "Sure. As we think about Q4 and I guess for the full year is there a new view on your signings target for this year, what needs to be achieved in order to see growth next year? And also just trying to understand a little bit more as a follow-on to ITO, and within ITO it sounds like you did some contract restructurings. Can you size that and is there more to do there? That\u2019s all I had, thank you.", "Kathy Mikells", "So if you look overall at the trends as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019ve basically seen a slippage of when we were expecting to see year-over-year improvements in signings. And so as we look to Q4 we\u2019d expect to see year-over-year improvement. I mentioned that we had one large renewal that should occur in Q4 \u2013 that should help both our renewal rate as well as our overall signings.", "With regard to ITO which I think was the second part of your question, we\u2019re really managing ITO as a niche business, looking to really have deals where we\u2019re partnering ITO with BPO and we\u2019re getting an overall I\u2019d say good margin performance from that support but not really chasing what I\u2019d call bigger commoditized deals in ITO. And as a consequence of that we certainly expect that we\u2019re going to have a lower overall growth rate in ITO. Now we are still winning new business in ITO. We won a new contract this quarter in ITO so it\u2019s a business that we absolutely are continuing to pursue, but we\u2019re being more selective in terms of what we\u2019re pursuing.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks Tien-tsin. Can we have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research ", "Thank you very much. I had a question with regard to restructuring both on the Document Technology side as well as on services. Just how are you thinking about restructuring as you go into 2015? What kind of opportunities do you think you\u2019re seeing, because it basically seems like you reinvested some of the upside this quarter on the Document Technology side into Services. So how do we think that all flows through and we see the opportunities in 2015? And then I have a follow-up, thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure, Shannon. So if you look at restructuring, the first thing I\u2019d say is we don\u2019t ex item restructuring, right? A big part of the reason we don\u2019t ex item restructuring is especially within our Technology business it is the regular course of our business. I think we\u2019re incredibly disciplined and very good about it. So when you look at what we\u2019ve done so far this year we\u2019ve done about $0.02 every quarter; we just guided to doing another $0.02 in Q4. And so I think you can continue to expect as you look forward that we\u2019re going to have those kinds of restructuring charges regularly.", "In terms of the mix of restructuring charges I\u2019d actually expect that we\u2019re going to see a little bit higher mix towards Services. Clearly one of the things that we need to do is further ramp up productivity initiatives. And so I would expect to see that mix change a little bit, but I\u2019ll just remind you that from an expense perspective we\u2019re always going to be technology heavy because those tend to be our higher-cost workers. And we\u2019ll continue to do a lot of work there.", "Shannon Cross \u2013 Cross Research ", "And maybe Bob, can you talk about specific areas where you think you can improve within Services, and again, how we think\u2026 Like what have you seen over the last several months that you\u2019ve been there and how are you sort of thinking about opportunities in \u201915?", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, Shannon, I think from an improvement standpoint at the macro level the two areas I would call out most visibly is we really do think that we can improve our sales conversion and we\u2019re taking a number of actions there. One is beefing up the sales team in terms of adding to the hiring; the second is a more aggressive sales training program that we\u2019re leveraging. So I would say one thing that I\u2019ve kind of concluded after seven months is that there was more that we could do there. ", "Ursula says to me if you\u2019re winning all the time you\u2019re not covering enough because you should have a mix of wins and losses in the marketplace so we\u2019re trying to broaden our coverage. And then I think the second area that I would call out that we\u2019ve been on but that we will be ramping up the pace is that we have moved to a global capability model around our delivery teams and kind of moving away from a 2500 strategic business unit structure to more managing delivery globally. And we believe that we can leverage that to drive productivity increases. That is part of what Kathy shared as we think about going forward. So those would be the two main things. ", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Shannon. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Hi, good morning. My question is around some of the things you said around 2015. It seems like there\u2019s a $0.06 hit year-over-year due to pension vis-\u00e0-vis the prior expectation and I was wondering if we could talk about at today\u2019s rate what currency, if there\u2019s a bottom line hit to currency what that is heading into next year and the next quarter; and potentially if you have to have lower Services margins than expected what that hit would be. ", "Basically I know you guys want us to wait for November 11th. What I\u2019m getting at is the street\u2019s at $1.20 for next year and if I pile these hits up then the EPS starts to look pretty flat unless the share count\u2019s materially lower for 2015. And I know you\u2019re going to want to say that at the Analyst\u2019s Day but I\u2019m wondering what you\u2019re trying to message with 2015 on this call given all those puts and takes I just articulated. So if you can just explain that, Kathy, that would be great. Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. Okay, so I\u2019m going to start by saying you\u2019ve just articulated a whole lot of puts and takes and so I\u2019ll try and cut a little bit to the bottom line. And we\u2019re still obviously ramping things up and are going to talk in a lot more detail as you mentioned at our November investor conference. So first you\u2019re right \u2013 with regard to pension settlement expense I think we\u2019re trying to articulate a couple of things. So we now have visibility to this, right? We print a discount rate once a year in Q3. We do our actuarial work and then we get visibility to pension expense.", "Importantly this is a highly volatile thing, our pension settlement expense. It has to do with nuances of our pension plan, the fact that we offer a lump sum and lots of people taker it, etc., but it\u2019s a noncash item. I think if you look overall at Xerox\u2019s cash conversion rate, net income to free cash flow, we have a cash conversion rate above 100% and we have very, very strong cash flow.", "If I look to currency which is the other large item that you mentioned, which we\u2019re getting benefits from this year, if I look at where rates are today with our currency transaction benefits really flowing from the Yen \u2013 if I look at where rates are at today our currency benefit should hold next year. If anything I\u2019d say maybe a little bit positive, but certainly as I look at rates right now they should hold next year.", "I talked about currency for Q4 from a translation perspective and so that\u2019s putting some headwinds overall on top line. Those headwinds don\u2019t have a real material impact in terms of bottom line results for us. So that gives you I think a little bit of a feel for some of the puts and takes, and I\u2019d come back and say importantly I think you continue to see our very strong cash flow results this year, our reiteration of guidance on strong cash this year. And as we look forward next year we expect to have continued very good conversion rate and cash flow.", "Ben Reitzes \u2013 Barclays Capital ", "Just did I miss it \u2013 did you reiterate the long-term Services ranges in terms of margins or are we going to address that at the Analyst\u2019s Day in terms of where we\u2019re going to be in the future on the long-term Services margins and your ability to be in that range?", "Kathy Mikells", "Yeah, so we\u2019ll address that at Investor Day but we haven\u2019t changed the expectation long-term for our Services business.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Ben. If we can have the next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. ", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray ", "Good morning, thanks for taking my questions. On Services margins, can you discuss what positive or negative surprises you saw in the quarter and what provides confidence Services margins can step up in Q4?", "Bob Zapfel", "Okay, it\u2019s Bob. From a negative surprises standpoint obviously we came in a little bit short of where we had committed we\u2019d come in. And I would say from a negative surprise standpoint we did make choices to invest more in a couple of the MMIS contracts and as Kathy referenced, we had a couple of IT outsourcing restructurings that we felt we could stay within the envelope of what the firm had committed in terms of overall earnings and position ourselves for better profit downstream in IT outsourcing. ", "On the positive side we are really having really strong success in our Commercial Healthcare business, both in terms of revenue growth and margin. And as Kathy mentioned I think in the prepared some of our other, Europe in particular had strong revenue growth and margin improvement and our HR and Learning and Litigation business also performed exceptionally well. So it was a mix of upsides and downsides.", "Ursula Burns", "If I can, George, one other thing that Bob has done is we have kind of loosened the reigns on his ability to hire at all levels of the company \u2013 kind of a little bit independent of matching cost decreases to the labor increases. So he\u2019s hiring at the high levels, at the intermediate levels and as he said earlier at the sales. We need to get the talent in across the board and we\u2019re not being cheap on that or we\u2019re not skimping on that.", "George Tong \u2013 Piper Jaffray ", "That\u2019s very helpful. We\u2019ve seen several quarters now of margin improvement in your commercial BPO business. Can you go into a little bit more detail on what drove that improvement and what levers you have for further expansion?", "Bob Zapfel", "Well I think the main levers for future expansion are what we\u2019re doing relative to these global capability organizations that we\u2019ve formed to really drive best practices sharing across our delivery model. So that\u2019s been a multi-quarter initiative on our part. We are largely complete and we see that as a way to capitalize on productivity initiatives right at the delivery model which is the vast majority of our resources. I mean sales is a relatively small portion of our headcount and a vast majority of our team is in delivery, so I would say going forward that\u2019s where we would get the yield. The previous improvement really related more to the labor initiatives around Optimus that you had visibility to from our investor meeting and previous calls.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, George. If we could have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from Bank of Montreal.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Hi, good morning, team. Bob, two for you if I could: the first one is can you win in BPO with subscale ITO? A lot of the vendors, Accenture and Genpact and others are starting to talk about bundling their IT capabilities with BPO to lead for successful engagements and market share wins. Xerox has a bit of a different strategy where your ITO is candidly subscale. If more of the business does get aggregated does Xerox have the platform to be successful? And I understand your BPO\u2019s a little bit different than some of the vendors but I just wanted to hear your thoughts on strategy as you look at the parts that Xerox brings to the table relative to the competition. I have a follow-up, thank you.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, I do believe we can win because in our BPO business, when ITO is a component of it the competitors that we face are not generally stronger in that ITO element. And I would say, Keith, that the decision is made on the platform and the strength of the BPO offering. So ITO in an integrated BPO play is really not the determinative or decisional characteristic, and again, when we\u2019re competing in our BPO business our win rate is very, very strong. And ITO is an underlying element of that, and as either Ursula or Kathy mentioned previously we had a nice, new logo ITO win in the quarter as well that was not directly tied to a BPO value prop but was a pure IT outsourcing play in the marketplace.", "Keith Bachman \u2013 BMO Capital Markets", "Okay, and thanks for that answer. My follow-up is your trailing twelve-month signings are down about 17%. Can you grow Services next year?", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, but we\u2019re concerned about trailing twelve-month signings being down at that level as well. So part of what\u2019s happened though is that when you are not signing the really big deals your term on signings shortens, because it\u2019s these half a billion dollar deals that tend to have a long term; and we have been winning much more with the shorter-term deals. So the correlation of revenue and signings is not quite the way that maybe we would have seen or modeled in the past. We are focused on driving signings improvement but even with the trailing twelve-month dynamics that you reference we believe we can grow revenue and improve our revenue performance. And as we\u2019ve said, BPO, we\u2019re now on our third consecutive quarter of improvement in our revenue dynamics even with the signings results that you referenced.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yeah, and the only other thing I\u2019d mention is that on new business our trailing twelve-month is down about 6%.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Keith. If we could have the next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital Markets ", "Hi, thanks for taking the question and congrats, guys, on a pretty solid quarter. Two if I could \u2013 I guess the first is a follow-up on Services for Bob and for Ursula. I guess in the context of how you expected the environment to feel, I guess specifically BPO, as we entered the year does the environment still feel the same? And there was a comment earlier that you\u2019re not changing your long-term view of your Services business model but has there been anything that\u2019s shifted in the context, in the environment of I guess your mid-single digit, your 5% to 7% long-term single-digit revenue growth model is predicated upon? I\u2019d love to get your thoughts there and then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula Burns", "I\u2019ll just start with the environment question. I think that overall at the high level we are not seeing major shifts in the business environment from a Services perspective. I mean clearly at the big deal, I think that Bob talked about some of the dynamics that you have with some of the very large deals where there is more of a propensity, at least we\u2019ve seen it, for people who move to actually protest and to actually hang in there a little bit longer. That\u2019s not what we have seen in the past but I think that\u2019s maybe what we\u2019ll be living with in the future. We\u2019re still confident in our ability to pull those deals out, we\u2019ve been awarded them but that\u2019s one thing.", "But the rest of the business I think is operating pretty much like we would have expected it to. We are refining our approach particularly in ITO. We\u2019ve spent a couple of questions on this already. ITO can grow but the margin contribution of ITO is something that is lower than the range that we actually want to play in and we are actually smaller there, so we\u2019re being very selective about how we approach ITO. And our change in that market space will actually change some of the revenue dynamics and for the positive we think, some of the margin dynamics on a go-forward basis. And then I\u2019ll have Bob take a crack at it.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah, the only thing I would add is I think when I\u2019m out in the marketplace with the teams and with the clients there is still a very good in my view high level of interest in leveraging partners in what I would call shared services. So ITO, I think the dynamics are a little bit different in terms of kind of trailing growth rates based on market dynamics. BPO, when you look at the areas that we have leadership positions in I would view that as still\u2026 I\u2019m pleased but I wouldn\u2019t have a view that the overall client interest is less than I expected when I joined the firm.", "Ananda Baruah \u2013 Brean Capital Markets ", "Got it, thanks for that. And then just quickly for Kathy, the raise on the buyback \u2013 you\u2019ve had capacity over the last couple of years to do something in the neighborhood of $1 billion and you sort of entered the year with a similar guidance of about $700 million. What is it about sort of raising the guidance to $1 billion right now in this quarter that gives you\u2026 You have the cash flow to do it so I know that gives you confidence but I guess I\u2019m asking has there been a philosophical shift within your approach to capital allocation that could continue forward as we move along here? Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yeah, so no overall philosophy change whatsoever. If you look at where we\u2019re at in terms of acquisitions we\u2019ve done a little over $300 million for the year. I expect that we\u2019ll get at least one or two things over the finish line before the end of the year but they\u2019re small, and so right now I think we will end up under-spending against our up to $500 million. We\u2019re not going to end up spending $500 million as I look out now, and clearly we have a very good history on to the extent we under-spend we shift that under-spending towards share repurchases. And that\u2019s clearly part of what we\u2019ve done.", "As I mentioned we entered the year with a quite strong cash balance that put us in a nice position to have a much more I\u2019d say consistent approach to share repurchases this year relative to last year. You\u2019ll recall we were very backend loaded but overall I think our philosophy is very consistent and we will continue to have a very balanced approach with regard to capital allocation.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Ananda. If we can have the next question, please?", "Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could point a little more towards the printing side of the business and it looks like we\u2019ve had a few quarters of accelerated decline in that business. And I\u2019m just kind of taking a look at how it\u2019s lumpy from quarter to quarter. And given the new product releases and how you\u2019re positioning and restructuring in that business do you think you could hit an environment where you have low-single digit declines as opposed to mid-single digit declines, and if so what would it take for that to happen?", "Kathy Mikells", "So right now we\u2019re consistently saying we expect mid-single digits. If you look at what\u2019s going on year-over-year, specifically Q3 and Q4 we have a little bit of headwind because last year we did these financed receivables sales and that generated a $20 million gain in each of Q3 and Q4 last year. So that was worth about a point of revenue growth or kind of headwind on growth this year. We do have I\u2019d say quarter-to-quarter timing differences largely associated with things like product launches with people kind of waiting for a new product launch and so we certainly get quarter-to-quarter differences. But at this point we see pretty stable declines in the mid-single digit range on an actual currency basis. I mentioned that\u2019ll be a little bit higher in Q4 as a result of the dollar strengthening against the Euro. But we\u2019re seeing pretty consistent trends in the business.", "Ursula Burns", "And I think if you look at it from a share perspective you\u2019ll see us marching along pretty consistently from a share perspective as well. So I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s anything that you can read into, or that we read into market dynamic changes and our positioning in the market. We\u2019re a strong leader and I don\u2019t think that we are losing any position in the marketplace.", "Brian Essex \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, and maybe one for Bob: it sounded like you had a pretty strong pipeline growth and I know the commentary was around there was some large deal elongation of signing cycles. Is that pretty much a concentrated, whether it\u2019s in terms of the government healthcare business or it\u2019s a larger secular trend? Or is there a situation where you get past a glut of some of these large deals and then maybe those signings accelerate and lead to better bookings through the end of the year? Maybe if you can provide a little more of the context of the mix of what\u2019s occurring in those signings.", "Bon Zapfel", "Yes, I would say on the larger deals it\u2019s not concentrated in government healthcare but it is public sector. So it\u2019s both our government healthcare business and our broader public sector business where we\u2019ve had relatively large opportunities that again we\u2019re pleased with being selected but getting to contract is taking longer.", "Jim Firestone", "Thank you. If we can have the next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna.", "Jamie Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Thanks, Jim. I wanted to ask first, Bob, there\u2019s a distinction between push-outs and protests, and protests seem to be the way of the world these days. So my question is if you were to add back the two large protests plus the renewal can you give us an estimate of where signings would have been in the quarter?", "Bob Zapfel", "Well each of the three large opportunities that we\u2019re referencing is over $500 million in total contract value and they would aggregate to close to $2 billion. But I would be careful to not now kind of add that to Q3. We were not expecting all of that yield in-quarter but that\u2019s the size of the three large transactions that we\u2019ve been talking about.", "Jamie Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Okay, thank you. And then Kathy, with regard to the discount rate for people with a longer-term investment horizon, rates move around each year \u2013 I realize that they\u2019re down in the discount rate that you\u2019re calculating for Q3. Could you share with us some sensitivity analysis, say that we\u2019re up 100 basis points next year \u2013 where would that leave the pension obligation? Thank you.", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. So where we see the most volatility in our pension expense is in the pension settlement expense line item, and that\u2019s where people can really change their behavior \u2013 either delay or accelerate the timing of taking their lump sum. If discount rates were more stable I\u2019d expect to see something closer to about $100 million of pension settlement expense annually.", "Jamie Friedman \u2013 Susquehanna Financial Group", "Got it, thank you.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks very much. If we could have the next question please, Operator?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ", "Thanks very much and I have one question and I guess it\u2019s hard for me to direct if it should go to Ursula, Kathy or Bob, but feel free all of you to chime in. On one hand I\u2019m very pleased to hear that Bob has the ability to hire more talent and invest in Services because I think that\u2019s what\u2019s really needed. But then on the other hand when I see the trailing twelve-month signings down, thinking about the ramping of the New York Medical contract \u2013 and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t want to have issues when that ramps or stands up \u2013 it makes me start to think that does this mean that Service margins, should they continue to be under pressure? ", "Or is it more, and I\u2019d kind of like Bob\u2019s view on this \u2013 is it more an issue that Xerox has like misaligned costs or too many low-end contracts, or contracts that are non-accretive with variables to protect Xerox\u2019s profits and therefore you have some changes and Xerox has to eat the costs because they weren\u2019t appropriately contracted out with more details? If you can kind of help us around this big strategy question around strategy for Xerox, and Bob you\u2019re new, and Ursula and Kathy have been striving to get Xerox Services up. Just kind of this whole big topic of strategy and what\u2019s going on, what\u2019s going forward with Services.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yeah Jim, this is Bob. Let me go first and then obviously Ursula or Kathy can add color as well. I would not say that we have severe contract misaligned costs challenges. Any services business is going to have a little bit of a bell curve of higher-margin deals that are further in the maturity cycle and entry deals that take a little bit of time to ramp up. We had a handful of situations in IT outsourcing that we tried to address in Q3 but I wouldn\u2019t have a point of view that we\u2019re out of balance on that score. ", "And if I go back to just your initial observations about adding talent I would add one piece of color, which is we\u2019re really pleased \u2013 I mean this, really pleased that while we have a very strong team in place today broadly, as we\u2019re trying to grow we are trying to add some incremental leadership to the firm. And the interest level and accept rate when we have been out trying to add a person to help us in this new area or that new area has been phenomenal. ", "So I feel good about both the existing talent that I had the pleasure of joining and in the selective places where we\u2019re looking to add to our leadership a very, very strong interest level and accept level of the people that we\u2019ve offered roles to.", "Ursula Burns", "My only add is the revenue engine is going; the cost base perfected by our move to this global capability. There\u2019s no other magic here; there\u2019s no structural contract issues or anything like that. It is a fairly normal business. It\u2019s hard to kind of get it totally contained. We\u2019re focused on the mouth \u2013 how much can we bring through these capacities, these capabilities that we have and making sure that we sign more business. And that\u2019s where Bob\u2019s energy and efforts are focused.", "Jim Suva \u2013 Citigroup ", "Great, thanks so much for the clarity.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Jim. If we could have time for one last question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.", "Kulbinder Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Thanks, most of my questions have been answered. It was just on Services margins \u2013 this year what are approximately the Medicaid kind of costs that are being assumed or that you\u2019re facing? And how long do those kind of last? Is that a headwind into next year as well? Thanks.", "Ursula Burns", "The Medicaid costs, let me have Kathy get a little bit more specific but they have been a big headwind for us. A major portion of the shortage we see in margins is driven by Medicaid investments. But we are seeing sequential improvement in those investments even though they are high.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yeah, the investments have been incredibly large. I\u2019ll just point to the impairment that we took last quarter which was $20 million. I mean if we look at this year-over-year it has been a big headwind for us every single quarter. In total we\u2019re probably approaching a $100 million number year-over-year. It\u2019s been a huge investment for us and it\u2019s been a big expense year-over-year. Now as we look forward to 2015 the fact that we\u2019ve invested so much in 2014 should help us in 2015, which doesn\u2019t at all suggest that we\u2019re not going to need to continue some level of higher investment as we have a few more implementations that are still underway. But from a year-over-year basis this should start to become a tailwind for us.", "Bob Zapfel", "And I would just add so we are driving for significant year-over-year improvement in that component of our portfolio, but it will not be at our target long-term margins next year. So we will be coming off of an unfortunately poor compare that we are delivering this year. We expect to drive visible improvement in 2015 but not already be to our long-term kind of target margins against that portfolio of our business.", "Kulbinder Garcha \u2013 Credit Suisse ", "Thank you.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Kulbinder. Okay, that\u2019s all the time we have for questions today. We thank you for your interest, and Ursula, anything more to wrap up?", "Ursula Burns", "Our goal is to have the solid foundation in place so that we can support our changing business and the changing needs of our clients while still delivering value for our shareholders. I believe that we\u2019re on track to do just that.", "Jim Firestone", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today.

Good morning thanks for joining our call. Today we're reporting fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings. A lot has happened in the last 90 days and overall we're pleased with where we ended the year. We're reporting solid results that in some places exceeded expectations. I'll give a quick overview of our financials, provide some perspective on the year and share updates on key initiatives contributing to our results before turning it over to Kathy to go into more detail on the financials.", "We delivered strong profit and cash for the year and we closed strong in services revenue and margin.

We remain focused on being the best partner to our clients and making Xerox a great place to work for our people and delivering value to our investors.", "Now let's take a look at the results in more detail. We delivered earnings just above our range and grew margin in both our segments and on a total Xerox basis. We're reporting adjusted EPS of $0.31 and GAAP EPS of $0.26. Profit improved this quarter as we made progress in Services. Services margin improved in the fourth quarter to 9.8% and we continued to benefit from a favorable environment and strong operational management in Document Technology.", "On the revenue side, the improved growth in Services to 3% in the quarter is notable especially considering the impact from the loss of the Texas Medicaid contract. Document Technology revenue declined in-line with recent trends. Acquisitions remain a key aspect of our portfolio management strategy. For the full year 2014, we invested almost $350 million in acquisitions.", "We're focused on enhancing our Services offerings and expanding our global reach. We have a goal in 2015 to get more done on this front, up to $900 million in acquisitions with part of those funds coming from the sale of our ITO business. With that objective in mind, we closed on one modestly sized acquisition since the beginning of the year, Intrepid Learning Systems which includes a service to ensure companies' employees are equipped with the latest skills and knowledge to improve their business performance.", "And underpinning our results in business model is strong cash generation. We closed the quarter with $850 million in cash from operations and over $2 billion for the year. This supported our acquisitions activity, growing dividends and share repurchases. In fact, we announced today a 12% increase in our annual dividend rate to $0.28 per share.", "Shifting ahead to 2015, our results will be impacted by the recent volatility in foreign currencies. As a result, we have adjusted 2015 guidance to reflect these headwinds. Kathy will go into greater detail on currency in just a moment.", "With that, I will turn it over to Kathy, then I'll wrap up and we'll open the call for your questions. Kathy?", "Kathy Mikells", "Thanks, Ursula and good morning, everyone. We were pleased with the progress we made this quarter. Both Services revenue growth and margin improved and with the announcement of the planned sale of our ITO business to Atos, we took a key step in our portfolio management strategy. In addition, our Document Technology business continued to deliver strong profitability. The positive results in Services and Document Technology yielded earnings higher than our expectations and strong cash flow.", "I'll cover the segments and cash flow in a moment, but first let me walk through our fourth quarter earnings. As noted earlier with the pending sale of our ITO business, my commentary will be on a continuing operations basis excluding ITO.", "Total revenue in the quarter was down 3% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. This compares to down 2% at both actual and constant currency in the third quarter. Underlying constant currency growth improved from the third quarter driven by better Services performance. And as expected, we saw the impact of actual currency rates turn negative in the quarter.", "Gross margin of 32.1% was up 10 basis points year-over-year as the positive benefit in Document Technology from productivity initiatives, currency and pension expense more than offset the greater mix of services at a lower margin. RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year as increased investments in Services were more than offset by reductions in Document Technology.", "SAG was lower in both segments as we benefited from productivity initiatives as well as lower bad debt and pension expenses. These improvements resulted in our fourth quarter operating margin increasing a 100 basis points year-over-year and operating profit growth of almost 7%. And for the full year, operating profit improved $72 million and operating margin was up 60 basis points.", "Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net was a $6 million higher expense year-over-year. Lower gains on sale of assets of $20 million and ruble-related currency losses of $5 million were only partially offset by $19 million in lower restructuring costs. For the full year, a tough compare resulted in adjusted other net expense coming in $102 million higher. In 2013, we realized greater benefits from transaction gains and other non-operational below-the-line credits. In addition, restructuring charges were $13 million higher this year.", "Our equity income was $41 million in the fourth quarter down $2 million dollars year-over-year driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 25.3% was up about 1 percentage point year-over-year and within our guidance of 23% to 27%.", "Adjusted EPS of $0.31 was $0.04 higher year-over-year driven by operating profit growth and lower share count. For the full year, adjusted EPS of $1.07 was $0.03 higher as operating profit growth and lower share count were partially offset by higher adjusted other net expense.", "I'll now move to the Services segment slide to review those results in a little bit more detail. Services revenue grew 1% and was up 3% in constant currency which was two points better sequentially. Within Services at constant currency, BPO growth increased to 4% from 2% in the third quarter with good growth in commercial healthcare payer, electronic tolling, litigation services and international. Document Outsourcing was up 1% year-over-year at constant currency, a modest improvement from the third quarter but under our segment growth objective. We're beginning to see good traction from our next-generation MPS offerings and we're encouraged by the good signings in the quarter.", "Overall in Services we're making progress improving growth and we continue to expect 2% to 4% constant currency Services growth this year. Our growth rate will be lower in the first half, reflecting the impact from the Texas Medicaid contract loss last year, slower first half Document Outsourcing growth and expected ramp timing for a couple of large new business contract awards. The Texas loss creates a headwind of about 150 basis points until we lap it in August.", "Total signings in the quarter were up 20% driven by strong growth in renewals including the large BPO contract renewal that I referenced last quarter which helped to drive a strong BPO renewal rate of 93%. BPO new business was light as we're still working towards signed and approved contracts for the New York Medicaid and Florida tolling new business awards. We're getting closer on both and continue to expect them to sign in the first half.", "Our sales force is now aligned to specific industry verticals and we're investing in increased sales coverage and training. These actions will positively impact new business signing as we move through 2015. Document Outsourcing signings of $1 billion were the highest in recent history with good growth on both the renewal and new business side. So a good signings quarter for Document Outsourcing which should enable growth to pick up by the middle of the year.", "Shifting to profitability, segment margin was 9.8% in the fourth quarter which was up 70 basis points sequentially, up 10 basis points year-over-year and toward the higher end of our targeted 9% to 10% range. We're making progress on our Services initiative and improving execution.", "In BPO, we saw multiple lines of business contribute to the year-over-year profit improvement and Document Outsourcing margins remained strong. Our results in government healthcare were in-line with our expectations and we're seeing positive results from our investments to mature the platform and improve our operational performance. We're confident we\u2019re on the right track and we started some work ahead of finalizing the New York Medicaid contract to ensure we get off to the right start there.", "In 2015 our focus will be on accelerating growth and driving a solid 50 basis points of margin improvement year-over-year. In summary, the fourth quarter was the strongest quarter of the year for Services both in terms of growth and margins and we're taking the actions required to hit our targeted 2015 core operating results.", "With that I will now turn to Document Technology. Fourth quarter total revenue in Document Technology was in-line with our expectations with constant currency results down 6% which was consistent with the full year rate of decline. As expected, the impact of actual currency rates turned on us this quarter with a negative two point impact.", "Equipment revenue declines were higher driven by weakness in Eurasia, reflecting the volatility in Russia's economy as well as the timing of large account sales. The decline in annuity revenue moderated a bit sequentially driven by modestly higher supplies demand and a more favorable compare given the prior-year channel inventory reduction. Similar to last quarter, the finance receivable sales in the prior year was almost a one point negative impact to revenue growth.", "From a geographic perspective, the U.S. and Europe were relatively stable, while developing markets outside of Russia was a positive contributor to results. Looking at our product groups, High-End remains the best performing sub-segment, reporting annuity growth at constant currency for the third quarter in a row. We saw good traction from the recent launch of our new Versant Entry production color product as well as good growth in our iGen product family.", "Mid-Range color activity was relatively flat and consistent with the third quarter as we continue to lap our ConnectKey launch from last year. Mono declined in-line with industry trends.", "Entry A4 activity was lower year-over-year given weakness in Eurasia as well as the timing of our Entry product refresh. We launched 11 new products late in the third quarter and early in the fourth. Market reception has been positive, but the timing caused us to only catch a partial benefit in the quarter.", "Profitability was quite strong. Our Q4 margins came in above our expectations at 14.4%, resulting in segment profit growth of 14%. This strong performance reflects benefits from restructuring and productivity initiatives, positive transaction currencies that more than offset negative translation impact and lower bad debt expense as well as lower pension expense. So another solid quarter for Document Technology.", "Now I'm going to turn to cash flow. Before I go through the cash flow, I would like to make one comment related to the announced ITO sale. Our GAAP net income includes a non-cash loss triggered by the pending sale of the ITO business of approximately $180 million driven mainly by goodwill allocated to that business. You can see the loss is added back further down in the cash flow statement; so net-net there's no cash flow impact.", "Moving on, our cash flow from operations was $857 million in the quarter and a little over $2 billion for the year which was just above our range. As expected, cash flow in the quarter and full year were lower solely due to the impact from finance receivable sales in prior years versus no sales in 2014.", "Looking at the full year underlying cash flow which excludes the impact from prior finance receivable sales, was $2.5 billion and compares to $2.1 billion in 2013. The largest driver of the year-over-year improvement in underlying cash flow was a reduction in net working capital resulting from both performance and timing factors including lower DSO and improved year-end collections, especially in Services improved terms with a few key vendors as well as seasonal smoothing of working capital.", "Additionally, we have higher runoff from our underlying finance receivables associated with lower originations as well as lower equipment revenue. These year-over-year benefits were partially offset by higher pension funding. Moving down the cash flow statement, investing cash flows were a $129 million use in the quarter and a $703 million use for the full year. For the full year, we spent $452 million on CapEx and $340 million on acquisitions.", "Cash from financing was a use of $297 million in the fourth quarter and $1.6 billion for the year, included in that full year amount is $1.07 billion spent on share repurchases and $313 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.", "Now I'll quickly cover our capital structure. We ended the year with $7.7 billion in debt which excludes approximately $75 million in capital lease obligations related to our ITO business which were reclassified to a discontinued operations liability account. Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at year-end was $4.2 billion leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain a leverage ratio consistent with our investment-grade ratings. Our financing debt has come down over the past few years driven by finance receivable transactions as well as lower originations.", "During 2015, we have two tranches of debt coming due, about $1 billion in February and $250 million in June. We continue to be comfortable with our leverage position and we plan to refinance these notes during 2015 which will result in our year-end debt being roughly flat at about $7.7 billion. So our capital structure remains stable; and if we move to the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation. During 2014, we returned close to $1.4 billion to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends.", "This equates to approximately 85% of our free cash flow for the year. Those numbers include $1.07 billion of share repurchases and approximately $300 million of dividends. We also spent a total of $340 million on acquisitions, that's $185 million higher year-over-year, but shy of our target of up to $500 million. We obviously have more work to do here and we're focused on concentrating on a bit larger deals as well as adding more resources into this area.", "For 2015, our capital allocation plan is unchanged and it reflects the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale. On share repurchase, we plan to spend about $1 billion repurchasing stock in 2015. We continue to view our shares as an attractive price and it's a good investment. On acquisitions, we expect to spend up to $900 million. In keeping with our portfolio management strategy, we're looking to acquire companies that will expand our capabilities in attractive service areas as well as extend our global reach in Services.", "As I mentioned on debt, we're comfortable with our leverage position and expect to end the year roughly flat at $7.7 billion. Finally on dividends, we're announcing today a 12% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share. This will result in spend of just over $300 million with share repurchases effectively self-funding most of the increase.", "Before I turn it back to Ursula, I would like to summarize our expectation for the full year as well as the first quarter. As Ursula mentioned, we've seen a sharp movement in currencies around the world in the last 45 days. Where we would normally offset modest currency impacts, the dramatic nature of this move creates almost $100 million of profit exposure year-over-year.", "Most significant to us in this short time the euro has weakened by about 10% versus the dollar and 9% versus the \u00a5 and the Canadian dollar has weakened 7% against the dollar. These currency moves cause both negative translation and transaction impacts. While we continue to look for ways to offset more of this negative impact, we believe it's prudent to capture the current exposure by revising our guidance.", "Let me walk you through the details on where we're at on full year guidance and then I'll cover the first quarter. On revenue, our constant currency expectations are unchanged versus what we communicated at our November Investor Conference, Total company roughly flat at constant currency, Services up 2% to 4% with growth improving as we move through the year, Document Technology down 4% to 5% which reflects some improvement as the negative impact of the prior finance receivable sales moderate and we realize more benefit from our product launches late in the second half of last year.", "However, we now expect currency will have a negative 3 to 4 point impact to revenue for the full year versus flat to about 1 point previously communicated with Document Technology having a little higher impact and Services a little lower given the geographic mix of the revenues.", "On margins, we continue to target a 50 basis point improvement year-over-year in Services which would put us at the middle of our 9% to 10% range. For Document Technology, we continue to expect to be within our 11% to 13% range, but likely more towards the middle of the range driven by year-over-year increased pension costs that we've talked about previously as well as the negative net currency impact.", "As a result of the lower expected revenue and actual currency as well as related pressure on Document Technology margins, we expect the flow-through to impact earnings roughly by $0.06 and as a result we're lowering our full year adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1.00 to $1.06.", "Turning to cash flow, the timing of the ITO sale negatively impacts free cash flow as we expect to sell the business in the first half and it produces most of its free cash flow in the second. Additionally, currency impacts our cash, presenting another headwind. We expect to offset some of this impact in 2015 and incremental M&A should offset the ITO impact next year. Net-net, we're bringing down our operating cash flow guidance by $200 million to $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and our free cash flow down $100 million to $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion.", "Now to first quarter guidance. In Document Technology, we anticipate revenue declines to be down mid-single digits in constant currency with actual results about four points lower given currency rates particularly the weakening of the euro and Canadian dollar. We expect Q1 Document Technology to continue to deliver very strong margin, but seasonally they'll be lower and below last year's 12.2% driven mainly by higher non-cash pension expense as well as negative currency impact.", "In Services, constant currency revenue growth will be at the low end of our 2% to 4% full year guidance range driven by tougher compares, expected timing of ramping awarded new business and slower Document Outsourcing growth. We expect currency to have about a three point negative impact. We expect margins to be seasonally lower, but up modestly year-over-year.", "At the consolidated level for the first quarter, we expect revenue will be down 1 to 2 points at constant currency with 3 to 4 points of negative currency impact. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.20 to $0.22 which includes approximately $0.02 of restructuring. The decline versus $0.26 last year is driven by higher non-cash pension expense, adverse currency, higher OID given a prior-year gain on asset sale as well as a higher tax rate, 26% planned this year versus 20% last year. That's partially offset by improvements in Services' operational performance as well as lower share count.", "Overall, we're making progress in our core business operations and will be working hard to offset the pressure we're seeing from currency.", "With that, I'll hand it back to you, Ursula.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions, so I will summarize quickly. Our fourth quarter shows our strategy is sound and the decisions we've made have put us on the right path forward. We're seeing the benefits of strong operating profit from Document Technology and improving profits and revenue in Services, where we're making visible progress. Our Services business is now better positioned for future growth.", "We know 2015 is already bringing some headwinds. As we mentioned earlier, we're watching the unprecedented movements in currencies especially the euro as Kathy outlined, but as always, we will manage with a disciplined approach. We will work hard and make the necessary adjustments to our operations.", "Our commitment remains the same and our diversified portfolio and strong cash flow, combined with our operating model, guides our priorities. In Services, building on the momentum to increase sales and profits through portfolio management improved productivity and excellent offerings. In Document Technology, capitalizing on the most advantaged segments of the business to maintain our leadership position in the industry, while maintaining strong profitability and we will continue to generate healthy cash flow to deliver shareholder value.", "Thank you and now over to you, Jim.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Also let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks.", "For the Q&A, I ask participants to limit follow-on and multipart questions so we can get to everyone and at the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of George Tong with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "We saw nice Services margin expansion this quarter, both on the year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter basis. Can you discuss what's changed this quarter to yield a positive inflection in Services margins and the work you have in the pipeline to sustain the positive momentum?", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. I'll start and then maybe Bob can add some color. Overall, we have been working throughout the year in terms of building initiatives, especially around reducing our overall cost structure from a productivity perspective, looking to get greater growth out of the areas where we have higher margins and as we pivot forward towards 2015, organizationally; changing our go-to-market approach, focused by industry and putting together operating capabilities that go across the company in order to help us to drive further productivity enhancements.", "One of the factors was clearly our overall government healthcare solutions business, stabilizing for us. It came in I would say very consistent with our expectations and our overall margins came in consistent with our expectations as well. So we feel good about the fact that our government healthcare business is performing a little bit better. Obviously, we had a lot of pressure in that business in 2014 and it's one of the areas as we look to 2015 that we're expecting continued improvement.", "So as you look towards 2015, our fourth quarter performance I think is right in-line with what we expected in Services and it gives us that much more confidence in our 50 basis point margin expansion expectations for next year. Bob, I don't know if you want to add more color.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, I would just add we had good cost management generally across the board by our teams and in government healthcare we as Kathy said, had stabilization and were really able to absorb investments that we were making in advance on New York and still fit if you will, inside the targeted margins that we want to deliver. So overall, the plays that we've developed relative to global capabilities and managing our cost structure seemed to have reasonable yield last quarter.", "George Tong - Piper Jaffray", "And then as a follow-up, we're seeing Xerox take a more verticalized industry approach in its Services business. Can you discuss progress you are seeing with this initiative and discuss how verticalization may impact pipeline performance on a near-term and intermediate-term basis?", "Bob Zapfel", "Let me briefly cover that. This is Bob, obviously. I would say we're seeing already better cross-selling opportunities. So as we go to market and we've moved out of our large number of independent business units and we have a sales force that has a broader responsibility of all the offering set to those clients, we're seeing better cross-selling opportunities. We had the whole team together for a big sales kickoff and I think that that's off to a fair start.", "I would say relative to pipeline as you saw from our release, our overall pipeline numbers are down marginally. There are a lot of moving parts relative to pipeline with taking ITO out and trying to count once validated as opposed to just earlier in the cycle, once noticed. But I would expect our pipeline to grow during the year as a result of the sales force additions and the focus on customers in vertical markets.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Shannon Cross", "A question with regard to acquisitions for Ursula and Kathy and I guess Bob too, actually. Given the $900 million bogey that you've put out there for the year and then the history that we've seen over the past few years, how are you thinking about ramping it up? Is this -- you've got in the hopper a couple of large ones, so you feel like it can be done? Again, it's a much larger number than you've done in the past and then if you can't get there, I assume share repurchase is a focus, but would you want to keep the cash for some other purpose? Thank you.", "Ursula Burns", "It's a good question. We have been improving our acquisition flow, $150 million to $350 million to $900 million this year. It will be a difficult run for us, but it is one that we're absolutely committed to and we're putting in place activities, meaning people, incentives to the line people, people focused on deals as well to make sure that we can actually get up to the $900 million that we have laid out.", "This is a good problem to have, meaning we have the money and we will get a lot of it in the middle of the year and we want to spend it and people know. So we're working through it. I won't comment on any deals that we have in the hopper just to say that we're working on making sure that we can spend all $900 million.", "If we don't spend it -- I'll actually turn it over to Kathy. The strategy that we have is pretty much in place, but she can actually just reiterate it.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yes. One other thing I would comment on which I'm sure I've mentioned before, we have a desire to do what I would describe as chunkier deals. We're never going to get there just doing deals at $25 million at a crack, right? That's just infeasible. So that's clearly part of the overall strategy. And as Ursula mentioned, the fact that we've loudly broadcast this hopefully helps to generate a little bit bigger pipeline.", "We're also very actively engaging the business people, right? Bob certainly would tell you it's something that's a top priority in the business people. So we're working collectively across the organization in order to make this happen. Finally on timing, we recognize that this is a big step up for us in 2015 in terms of what we're trying to accomplish. By the way, the incremental money is not coming in the door until the middle of the year, so just a note for folks on that.", "So there is a possibility that we won't get 100% of the $900 million spent this year. Our expectation is we would look to flow that over, in trying to accomplish more in the first quarter of 2016. We've already announced that we're going to do roughly $1 billion in share repurchases this year. We ended the year with a strong cash balance to enable us to again be more consistent in terms of being in the market consistently. So that's what we expect to do with the money and we're all working hard to get it deployed as fast as possible.", "Shannon Cross", "And then as a follow-up, can you talk a little bit about what your metrics are around potential acquisitions? How we should think about accretion, what you're focused on from a financial standpoint when you look at prospective acquisitions.", "Kathy Mikells", "First and foremost, we're focused on what I would call return-adjusted, risk-adjusted returns. We're interested in doing good deals. We've been historically very disciplined, we're certainly not going to change that in our approach. So first and foremost that's what we're interested in.", "Of course, we always look at what's the accretive, dilutive nature of the transaction, how much are we paying for it etcetera, we're focused on trying to do deals that generate synergies because then we have more dollars to play with in what's a pretty competitive marketplace. But those are some of the things that we're focused on overall and I say before any of the math, we're focused on buying companies that are a great strategic fit for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "It's Tien-tsin. Just want to ask on the Services margin front again, just all the different puts and takes. I know there is a lot of government healthcare expenses, etcetera you've got some project delays with Texas and Florida. So can it be higher if we normalize for government and healthcare and some of these unusual items? Trying to understand what's going on underneath the business in Services on the margin front, if that makes sense.", "Bob Zapfel", "Well the overall margins are still lower as a result of our margin dynamics in government healthcare. So without question the Services portfolio runs at an overall higher margin than we publish as a result of the investments that we're still making in government healthcare. But I think as we said, we've got that stabilized. We had improvement both sequentially and quarter-to-quarter. But as we're looking to ramp up, you'll remember from the investor conference a reasonable source of our targeted improvement in 2015 this year was coming out of GHS. We talked about that as being 25 to 40 basis points of potential improvement. So that is still our focus and we think we have got strong plans to yield that.", "Kathy Mikells", "One other comment I would add is, if you went back to the investor conference along the things that we're targeting -- improvement in government healthcare, delivering productivity through our now horizontal operational capabilities, continuing portfolio management, investing in our platforms, there is a yield we expect from that beyond 2015 as well, right? So 50 basis point solid improvement is what we're trying to put up on the board this year with an expectation that that would continue.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Just my follow-up then on Texas, Florida. How much visibility do you have on the timing of that? To the extent that those things are pushed out, could that have any revenue and margin impact? What's the cushion there? Thank you.", "Ursula Burns", "I think you mean New York and Florida, not Texas and Florida, but Bob will answer it.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, we built the 2% to 4% revenue growth commitment that we've made with a plan to get both Florida and New York to come to closure in the first half. We're still very much on track with both of them in terms of meeting the milestones. So I would say that we're on track with both. They are in our range and we don't expect either of them to not be successful in terms of us being a partner with those clients both with Medicaid in New York State and with tolling in Florida.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Barclays Capital. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Ben Reitzes", "I wanted to ask about puts and takes for the guidance a little more for 2015. In the fourth quarter, it looks like bad debt year-over-year was a $0.025 benefit, and now moving into 2015, I was wondering what bad debt was for the year versus currency. If that goes the other way with what's going on in some of the economies you serve. I was wondering if the guidance actually had offsets for if that goes the other direction. And then I had a quick follow-up. Thanks.", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. As we look at our fourth quarter beat in Doc Tech, we recognize that some of the beat is coming out of bed debt; some of the beat was coming out of pension, right? So we ended the year at a higher level overall for the full year than what we would have talked about at our investor conference last November. So we're taking that into account then as we look at what the year-over-year changes are expected to be.", "So my commentary around -- as we stare at our margin guidance of 11% to 13%, back at the investor conference I would have been more bullish on the higher end of that range versus now talking about coming down towards the middle, that's taking into account. Ben, both the fact that bad debt will be a year-over-year headwind for us. We expect bad debt overall I will call it, the rate of bad debt to continue to be just fine.", "It's improved over the last couple of years and that should continue, but certainly we had a phenomenal 2014 in terms of what the overall bad debt expense is and so we're reflecting that in our margin guidance.", "Ben Reitzes", "And then just a quick follow-up on Document Technology. Are you seeing price competition from Japan based competitors who can flow through the benefits of the yen? If so, how is that flowing through your margin guidance as well which you just commented on for that segment?", "Kathy Mikells", "We have been asked this question I feel like every quarter for the last -- since the yen moved from 85. We haven't seen any meaningful change overall in the competitive environment. We always have pricing impacts that range 5% to 10%. Clearly big enterprise deals are always more hotly competed; but overall, we haven't seen a meaningful shift in the market.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah with Brean Capital. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Ananda Baruah", "Just two if I could. The first is just, Bob with regard to any potential operating margin impact when you go ahead and sign both New York and Florida. Can you give us some sense of whether we should expect any standup impact to manifest and what kind of contingencies you might have been able to put in place heading into those? You just seem to have pretty good visibility to standing them up.", "And then I guess just the second one is when you guys announced the sale of ITO, I think the commentary was that at that point you expected to be able to make up any impact to 2016 through the combination of buyback and efficiencies on the EPS line. Now that FX is impacting EPS by about $0.05 to $0.06, do you think there is anything you can do as you go through 2016 to make up that incremental $0.05 to $0.06? And those are my two questions. Thanks.", "Bob Zapfel", "Let me start with the first question, relative to standing up both Florida and New York, we've built that into our guidance when we shared with you and the rest of the community our target to be a 50 basis points improvement in the 9% to 10% range. We've already absorbed some of that hit in the fourth quarter with New York because we wanted to invest in advance.", "So do we have to? Do we not run at as high a margin upfront in standing new contracts? Absolutely. But that's part of our design and sourcing model and you should not need to expect any degradation as a result of winning that business. We want to win it, we plan for it and we have the cost in our outlook.", "Kathy, I'll turn to you on the Atos and 2016 question.", "Kathy Mikells", "Yes. At the time that we announced the ITO sale to Atos, we brought our guidance down to reflect the impact of the dilution which we would only be able to slightly offset this year with an expectation that we would offset the remainder in 2016. So that's really about getting the share repurchases deployed and getting the M&A accomplished as well as, I would say offsetting some of the friction costs associated with the transaction, stranded costs that we then need to attack. So we're still absolutely there in terms of offsetting that impact.", "The second question you asked was really about currency and our ability to offset the currency impact. Embedded in our guidance for 2015 already is an expectation we're going to offset a little bit of that impact. You heard me in my prepared remarks say it's worth a little over $0.06. We're bringing down our EPS guidance by $0.05. So we're expecting that we're going to drive harder to offset some of that impact and it's built-in already.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Keith Bachman", "A question and a clarification, the clarification first. Kathy, the $0.06 that you talk about for FX, does that include the benefit of the yen to cost of goods sold for the printing side? And how much is that benefit in 2015 due to the yen?", "Kathy Mikells", "So it includes everything and so as you can imagine for any global company, everything is a big everything. It includes all the translation impacts, right? So we talked a lot about impacts to revenue and those impacts have some flow-through to profit. The ultimate margin impact of that is a little bit dampened because it's hitting both revenue as well as profit. And it includes all of our purchasing and the hedging that we do associated with purchasing. So it is all-in.", "Keith Bachman", "My question is -- I'm going to direct it to Bob. If you think about the sale of the ITO business, Bob, if you look back over the last two years and I realize you haven't been there over the two years. But if you think about the BPO side of the business, is there a way that you could quantify how that BPO business was tied to ITO? In other words, when you think about the work of -- how much of the ITO business or the BPO business had ITO tied to it? And what I'm really going back to is the thought process around -- how is the sale of ITO going to impact the ability of Xerox to win BPO business as you look forward to? I understand you can outsource to folks like Cognizant or [inaudible] I should say to Cognizant, but I'm just wondering how it might impact your win-rate by not having in-house ITO capabilities. Thank you.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes. No, I appreciate the question. This was a really big strategic thought for us, because obviously we're betting a lot on our ability to drive growth in BPO and Document Outsourcing. When we looked -- I won't just do the two years, I will go at our portfolio. We had ITO in a little over half of our BPO revenue stream but at a very, very modest amount. So most of our big BPO plays had little server management. I'm not on the ITO contracts themselves which were big contracts for us.", "And we really have found in the -- I guess we're 30 days plus, 40 days, we have a very good customer reaction. So as we go around with our clients and say our future delivery model includes Atos as a delivery partner as a piece of this delivery ecosystem. I do not view it as something that's going to compromise or put us at a competitive disadvantage. They bring a lot of assets relative to the ITO space and we think that that team is an even better team for our BPO business than going it alone.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Essex", "I guess the first question for Kathy. As we think about some of the headwinds in particular to cash flow this year, whether it's FX or pension expenses and we talk about normalized cash flow being over $2 billion cash from operations, how do we think about how some of those pieces may move? Or how do you think about them as we're forecasting for 2016 and beyond?", "I guess which ones would you expect to be more prominent in 2015 given where interest rates and FX are? And when might we see a greater inflection or will we see a greater inflection towards normalized cash flow in '16 and beyond? Particularly post the sale of ITO.", "Kathy Mikells", "I'm going to just start with a discussion about free cash flow, right? We brought our free cash flow guidance down by $100 million. Part of that obviously reflects the sale of the ITO business. We would expect to start to offset that as we do more M&A, basically utilizing the proceeds. So I would call that impact transitory impact, right?", "Clearly we've said we think we'll be able to offset some of the currency impacts in 2015, reflected in the guidance that we gave with respect to free cash flow. But the company is an incredibly, I would say solid and consistent cash flow producer and the sale of the ITO business is really just a modest, transitory impact on cash flow. I'm not going to try and call where currencies go in 2016, but obviously we're going to do everything that we can to offset the currency impact as much as possible.", "Overall with regard to pension, we're increasing our pension funding this year by about $50 million. I would expect our pension funding starts to stabilize at that point, unless there is an opportunity to do something more materially with our pension which at this point I don't necessarily see. So I think the overall factors around our cash flow are very solid. We've reduced it at the moment for some transitory issues, but I wouldn't expect those to last forever.", "Brian Essex", "Okay. And can we get a sense of the capital intensity that ITO accounted for? And where might that have been offset by redeploying those funds into other areas?", "Kathy Mikells", "Yes. Our ITO business was in the Services side clearly our most capital-intensive business, lower ROIC business for us which strategically is much of behind the sale. Not to mention we were a subscale player in ITO relative to some of our competitors. So from that perspective, its impact on free cash flow is much less and its impact on operating cash flow which is part of the reason we only brought it down modestly. We would expect we're going to deploy it into BPO which is not nearly as capital intensive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Shope with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Bill Shope", "There are obviously a few moving parts in the technology business this year, so I wanted to understand the timing of some of the puts and takes you've talked about. So could you give us a bit more color on how we should think about the revenue trajectory margin path and some of these product cycle dynamics as we progress through the year? And I guess particularly how we think about the dynamics as we move from first half to second half.", "Kathy Mikells", "Sure. As we progress through the year, just in terms of the revenue dynamics going on in Doc Tech, we'll get a bit of a benefit as a result of just from a year-over-year comp perspective. You know not doing the forward receivable sales anymore. So that had in the third and the fourth quarter about point of negative impact in 2014. So we will get an easier comp towards the back half of the year.", "From a foreign currency perspective on Doc Tech with regard to top line, translation impacts to top line have been immediately. The flip side of that is what's going on in transaction impacts. The transaction impacts don't hit us immediately as a result of our hedging program. So that's a little bit more back half it gets worse relative to front half as a result, that's obviously a profit and a margin constraint as opposed to a revenue constraint. So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "James Friedman", "I just had a housekeeping question; I'll ask all mine upfront. So Kathy, I just want to make sure that -- am I correct that the New York Medicaid is not in the signings number at this point? My next question for Bob was if you could comment about the pricing environment. And also, Bob, are there any problem contracts [inaudible] Nevada or Texas that you would call out at this point? Or if that's too specific if you could talk about the risk management at the firm overall? Thank you.", "Bob Zapfel", "I can probably answer all of those. So yes, Jamie, you're right, New York is not in those signings numbers neither New York nor Florida and while our overall signings were strong and the numbers were very positive, we do need to get new business ramped up and that's a big piece of that. Relative to the problem contract question, I would say we've made real progress in terms of the new systems implementations. We've got a strong team that we've added in 2014 that's really been driving that. So you can never say never in terms of issue in a given implementation. But overall we've made very good progress there and we're optimistic that we won't have big financial hits as a result of future problem contracts.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citigroup. Your line is now open.", "Jim Suva", "The signings number was very impressive for the quarter. A lot of times there is seasonality to them and maybe some deferrals that come in and things like that and so if you look at one quarter, your snapshot is very, very impressive. If you look at a trailing 12 month quarter run rate, you still have down 13%ish for a trailing 12 quarters. So can you help us bridge the gap of that trailing 12 months versus a very strong quarter and the outlook for surfaces and your confidence to grow that Services? Thank you.", "Bob Zapfel", "Jim, no, I would agree. We were happy with the quarter and the year-to-year growth that we had in the quarter, but still as you represented, we're down double digits on a trailing 12-month basis. And again the big piece that would have changed that is if we would have had a little bit earlier timing in either New York or Florida, but those are in front of us as opposed to already booked and in our signings numbers.", "But the renewals have been really strong. We have seven out of the last eight quarters in BPO that we've been over 90%, so we're very positive on the renewal rates and it's really a new business, getting more traction in our new business initiatives and we believe we will do that in 2015. That is a critical, critical element for us, maybe more on our 2016 revenue than on 2015, but it's a critical element for us and we're very focused on it.", "Jim Suva", "And then as a quick follow-up, you have a couple big contracts and on the call you made some references to New York and Florida that are not in the signings and I understand that correctly. But once they come into signings is there also a little bit of a timing item we should be aware of as far as when they get included into your revenues? I.e., like immediately when they sign, then the next day you can start to recognize revenues? Or is there a, hey, you signed it and then you have to sit down and talk about phases and timing and sometimes a quarter or two? Because each of those look to be quite substantial and I don't want to get too excited or maybe I should that they immediately start to enter the revenue stream.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, we generally begin to recognize revenue pretty quickly, but there is a ramp. So it's that you're not at full annualized revenue in the first quarter after the signing, but I would expect in both and the way we've built our track is we expect in both New York and Florida to sign in the first half, to then start a revenue flow, not at high margins, but that's all built into our guidance. But it does take a little bit of time, typically about two quarters before you get to the annualized run-rate.", "Jim Lesko", "Thank you. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thank you for your interest And Ursula, anything more to wrap up?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes. In summary, we have a clear and consistent plan in place and in 2014 we were successful in advancing our strategic initiatives. We have a focused management team, you've heard from them today, prepared to deliver the plan and in 2015 we're committed to enhancing our overall Services business while maintaining our market leadership in Document Technology. Additionally, we will continue to make investments to move the business forward.", "Jim Lesko", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. And if you have any further questions, please contact me or any member of the Investor Relations team. Thank you. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect.

Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (NYSE:USA) LLC (Broker)", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation First Quarter 2015 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Kathy Mikells, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "Ms. Burns, you may begin the call.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, and thanks for joining our call. Today, we reported our first quarter results and provided full year guidance lowering expectations. I'll start with a brief reminder of our direction and then provide an overview of our Q1 performance. Kathy will review the financials and then we'll take your questions. Our diversified portfolio, strong Annuity business and solid free cash flow enabled us to participate and invest in the attractive markets that will drive growth. Services represents 56% of our total revenue and we expect that proportion to continue to grow.", "We are the leader in diversified business process services and we are maintaining leadership in Document Technology. Over the last few years, we have taken significant steps to lay the foundation for sustainable, long-term success. We are differentiating ourselves by incorporating greater automation and intelligence in our solutions and products, all with the goal of helping our clients better manage their critical business processes.", "As an example, we recently launched the Midas+ readmission forecaster, an advanced analytics healthcare solution to help hospitals drive quality improvement around patient care and reduce Medicare penalties for excess hospital readmissions. Additionally, we introduced our new mobility analytics platform which makes it significantly easier for transport and parking operators to understand and even predict commuter needs. VINCI Park, the world's leading parking space provider, is testing the system in a town in the suburbs of Paris.", "Within Document Technology, we retained our number one position in equipment revenue market share for the 21st straight quarter, and we launched eight new products plus workflow solutions, reinforcing our leadership in mobile printing, inkjet technology, and digital color.", "Lastly, our solid balance sheet and strong free cash flow along with the proceeds from the pending ITO divestiture will enable us to continue to deliver strong shareholder returns. We have returned more than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the last four years and plan to do the same this year by repurchasing up to $1 billion in shares and returning approximately $300 million to shareholders in dividends. At the same time, we will continue to invest in our business organically and through acquisitions. Now let's look at our performance in the quarter.", "In the first quarter, we reported total revenue of $4.5 billion, down 6%, 2% in constant currency. And we delivered adjusted earnings per share of $0.21. Earnings were in line with our guidance, but the performance of our Services business was below our expectations, principally because of implementation issues in certain legacy Health Enterprise platform accounts. It's important to note that many areas of our Services business performed quite well in the quarter, this includes Document Outsourcing and several of our commercial vertical industry groups.", "We continue to perform well in Commercial Healthcare. As many of you may have seen, we finalized the New York Medicaid contract that we were awarded last year. We have invested in advance to ensure our good start, and we look forward to working with the state to serve their Medicaid population. That said, in Services, we have more work to do to improve our financial performance. We continue to align our go-to-market resources along vertical industries, and we're investing in sales coverage and training.", "At the same time, we're focused on driving more consistent delivery and capturing efficiencies through our new operating model. And specifically within our Health Enterprise accounts, we have taken action to address the issues. We continue to add expertise in the most critical areas of this business. Our operating performance and delivery quality continue to improve, and I'm confident in the Services and Healthcare teams. Kathy will go into more detail on the financials in a moment. And we can have additional discussion during the Q&A.", "Our Document Technology results, which included the increased impact from foreign currency, largely met our expectations. It continues to be a business where we generate strong profits and cash. In quarter one, we delivered shareholder value by repurchasing shares, supporting our dividend program, and acquiring Intrepid Learning Systems (sic) [Intrepid Learning Solutions] to enhance our services capabilities.", "Now, I'll turn it over to Kathy, who will provide more details on the quarter and cover guidance.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. We delivered Q1 EPS in the middle of our range with solid cash flow of $113 million. However, as Ursula mentioned, the quarter was challenging in many respects. Some challenges have been contemplated such as negative currency impacts, higher pension expense, and, in Services, the timing of investments relative to improved productivities from our global capabilities.", "However, we failed to accurately call the incremental financial pressure we're experiencing in our Government Healthcare business from the rollout of our Health Enterprise Medicaid platform. Our delivery quality and operating performance continue to improve, but the financials were a clear signal that we have more work ahead. I'll take you through more details on that when I cover the Services segment, but first let me walk you through the total company results for the quarter.", "Total revenue in the quarter was down 6% at actual currency and 2% at constant currency as growth in Services was offset by declines in Document Technology. The negative currency impact of 4 points in the quarter was at the high end of our expectations and reflected the continued strengthening of the dollar within the quarter.", "Gross margin of 31.2% was down 30 basis points year-over-year driven by Services. RD&E was modestly lower year-over-year, driven by reductions in Document Technology. SAG in absolute dollar terms was lower year-over-year, driven by currency. However, as a percent of revenue, SAG was up 70 basis points year-over-year to 20.5% as productivity benefits were more than offset by higher pension expense and the investments in Services.", "As a result, our first quarter operating margin decreased 110 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18% with the largest drivers being pension expense, the financial pressure from our Health Enterprise implementations and currency.", "Moving down the income statement, adjusted other net expense was $5 million lower year-over-year. Within that, lower gains on sales of assets and higher currency losses were offset by lower restructuring costs and lower interest expense. Equity income was $34 million in the quarter, down $8 million year-over-year, driven by the impact of negative translation currency. Our Q1 adjusted tax rate of 24.5% was at the low end of our range and up 4 percentage points year-over-year. Adjusted EPS of $0.21 was at the midpoint of our guidance and $0.05 lower year-over-year, driven by the operating profit decline.", "I'll now move to Services segment to review those results in a little more detail. Services revenue declined 3% and was up 1% at constant currency, which was a bit shy of where we expected to come in. Document Outsourcing constant currency growth up 2% was in line with our expectation. BPO growth up 1% at constant currency was a bit light of what we were targeting, with the Health Enterprise platform implementations producing less revenue than we had anticipated. We continue to see good BPO growth in Commercial Healthcare and other commercial industry verticals.", "We anticipate our revenue growth rate will improve in the second half as we lap the impact of last year's larger contract losses and begin to ramp the New York Medicaid and Florida Tolling deals. M&A also remains a variable factor to growth depending on timing of acquisitions. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 91%, evidence that overall we're delivering well for our clients. I should note that we are now including Document Outsourcing in our renewal rate in addition to BPO. Overall, it was a really strong renewal quarter.", "Total signings in the quarter were down 13%, driven by both lower new business signings and lower renewal opportunities. New business signings declined 26% year-over-year. We mentioned on our last call that we've aligned our sales force to specific industry verticals. We recently moved our Document Outsourcing sales force into the same structure to better enable cross-selling opportunities.", "We are continuing to invest in increased sales coverage and training, which takes time to yield results and should positively impact new business signings as we move through 2015. Additionally, our signings did not include the New York Medicaid contract, which was finalized after the end of the quarter; and the new Florida Tolling contract which is still pending. These new signings will reverse the downward signings trend this quarter.", "Turning to margin, segment margin was 7.5% in the quarter, which was down 110 basis points year-over-year and well below our objective of modest year-over-year improvement. As referenced earlier, the driver of the Services margin miss was lower revenue and more costs than anticipated with our Health Enterprise platform implementation. California had the largest impact on our results in the quarter. We successfully implemented the first phase at the end of last year, however, recent estimates to deliver the remaining phases are higher.", "We also had start-up costs in New York with no revenue offset as the contract didn't get finalized until April. Margin excluding those impacts would have been up 10 basis points year-over-year, so a very modest improvement. We saw margin improvements in a number of lines of business including Document Outsourcing as well as some of our commercial verticals. At the same time, we're continuing to invest in our industry and capability operating model, sales coverage and training as well as some new offerings, which Ursula discussed. As we move through the year, we expect to see our investments mature and produce more value. We should also see further productivity gains as we rollout our initiatives across our operating groups.", "Before moving on, I'm going to take a minute to further discuss the financial challenges we're facing in our Health Enterprise implementation. With the exception of the New York Medicaid contract, these deals were signed before we finished development of the core software platform. We had delayed finishing the new platform and meeting client delivery dates resulting in cost increases. In the case of California, as the new project plan was built out further, we recognized that the cost to complete the entire program would increase, which triggered an adjustment in the quarter. In contrast, New York was bid after the Health Enterprise platform was completed and we've been investing ahead to position us for a strong start.", "Operationally, the platform is performing well in the states where it's been rolled out and we're progressing on the implementations in other states. However, we have more work ahead to turnaround the financial performance. We're taking a number of additional actions to improve the picture and have adjusted our expectations to reflect what we believe is required to meet our customer commitment. This is the main driver of our revised Services margin guidance, which I'll get to more detail when I review guidance in a few minutes.", "Now I'm going to turn to Document Technology. Document Technology revenue in the quarter was largely in line with our guidance with adverse currency coming in at the high-end of our expectations. On a constant currency basis, revenue was down 6% which was consistent with last year's rate of decline. Currency was a 4 point drag on revenue with revenue at actual currency down 10%. While we don't typically include developing markets in our constant currency calculation, we are impacted when currencies devalue quickly. In the first quarter, revenue at constant currency would have been down 5% if we excluded the impact of currency on developing markets.", "Relative to our performance in the fourth quarter, we saw some moderation of equipment revenue declines at constant currency as we began to see some benefits from the second half 2014 new product launches. Offsetting this were modestly-worse Annuity revenue declines driven by supplies revenue declines in the Entry segment. Looking at Entry, it continues to be impacted by economic weakness and uncertainty in developing markets, especially Eurasia and Brazil. We anticipate some improvement in the rate of declines as benefit from new products grow but, overall, we continue to expect economic headwinds to weigh on Entry. Mid-range mono and color activity were relatively flat year-over-year and overall mid-range results showed improvement. High-end continues to show good Annuity revenue performance, although equipment was weaker in the quarter driven by the timing of new product launches as well as a couple of deals slipping into the second quarter.", "Document Technology margins were down 110 basis points with almost the entire decline driven by higher pension expense. As previously discussed, the higher pension expense this year is a function of higher pension settlement given lower discount rates as well as last year's mortality table change. So overall, core Document Tech business performance continues to be strong and we're focused on improving top line by capitalizing on our growth opportunities in the market.", "Before I go through the cash flow, I'd like to remind everyone that while our ITO results are included in discontinued operations pending the sale to Atos, ITO is still in our operating cash flow until we close the transaction. ITO was a use of $13 million in the quarter and a use of $32 million in free cash flow. Overall, cash flow from operations was $113 million in the quarter, solidly positive and reflecting the progress that we've made smoothing working capital impacts over the past couple of years. A couple of highlights to note within operating cash flow.", "The add-back for depreciation is lower than last year by about $50 million and reflects in part the write-down of the carrying value of the ITO assets to fair value now that it's being held for sale. Working capital is a use of cash which is consistent with our normal seasonality and largely consistent with 2014. Inventory was a larger use this year, reflecting a higher level of in-transit inventory and timing of sales. Additionally, accounts receivable was a higher use this year, primarily due to the strong fourth quarter collections, particularly in Services.", "Moving down the cash flow statement. Investing cash flows were a $98 million use, including $95 million spent on CapEx in the quarter and $28 million on acquisition. Cash flow from financing was a use of $485 million, which included net debt payments of approximately $150 million, $216 million spent on share repurchases, and $76 million used for preferred and common stock dividends.", "Now I'm going to quickly go over our capital structure. We ended the first quarter with $7.6 billion in debt. During the quarter, we retired $1 billion in senior notes and issued $400 million in five year notes with a coupon of 2.75% and $250 million in 20 year notes with a coupon of 4.8%. Applying 7-to-1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of the first quarter was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.7 billion. We manage our core debt to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade rating. So our capital structure remains pretty stable.", "If we go onto the next slide, I'll review where we're at in terms of capital allocation. Our capital allocation plans for the year are unchanged and, as previously communicated, incorporates the redeployment of the expected net proceeds of roughly $850 million from the ITO sale which should close later this quarter. On share repurchases, we spent $216 million in the quarter and continued to plan to spend about $1 billion for purchasing stock this year. We continue to view our shares as attractively priced and a good investment.", "On acquisitions, we closed one acquisition in the quarter, Intrepid Learning Systems (sic) [Intrepid Learning Solutions] for $28 million. We continue to look to spend up to $900 million in 2015 and plan to rollover any unspent funds into 2016. Acquisitions are a priority for us as we believe it's an important element of our portfolio management strategy to evolve our portfolio to higher value services as well as supporting BPO expansion internationally.", "We're very disciplined in our approach. Our pipeline is strong, and we've actively considered more deals year-to-date than last year. We're working to further build our business development capabilities so we can be more acquisitive and expand our pipeline of potential targets.", "Now onto debt. We have one more tranche of debt coming due this year, $250 million in June. We expect debt to temporarily decline in conjunction with the receipt of the ITO proceeds and plan to complete additional refinancing activity as needed in the second half. We continue to expect to end the year at roughly $7.7 billion in debt.", "And finally, on dividends, we spent just under $300 million, which contemplates the recent 12% dividend increase we announced on our last earnings call.", "Before I turn it back to Ursula, I'd like to summarize our expectations for the second quarter and for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $0.21 to $0.23, with constant currency revenue down about 2 points and currency pressuring top line by another 5 points, reflecting the dollar strengthening a bit from the first quarter. For Document Technology revenue, we expect the constant currency rate of decline to modestly improve from the first quarter with a negative currency impact of 5 points to 6 points. Margin should be within our 11% to 13% range for the year, up sequentially but down year-over-year driven by the increased pension cost and currency.", "For Services, we expect the second quarter year-over-year revenue growth to be roughly flat at constant currency, with a negative currency impact of 4 points to 5 points. Slow growth reflects softer signings as well as the timing of new contract ramp versus lost contract runoff and slower acquisition activity. We anticipate second quarter margins will be approximately flat sequentially, reflecting period compare headwinds in Document Outsourcing, continued higher cost to implement our Health Enterprise platforms, and incremental investments not yet fully offset by productivity gains.", "Document Outsourcing margins continue to be strong with normal year-over-year compares in the second half. For the full year, at constant currency, we expect Services revenue will now be at the low-end of the 2% to 4% range, no change to Document Technology with revenue expected to decline 4% to 5% and total company revenue now expected to be down about a point year-over-year. We expect currency will have a negative 4 point impact to total revenue for the year. We're maintaining our Document Technology margin expectations but reducing our Services margin guidance to 8.5% to 9% due to higher costs within our Health Enterprise implementation and not as much net benefit from enhanced productivity relative to investments. In total, we expect this to yield adjusted EPS of $0.95 to $1.01.", "To conclude, while we are disappointed with the guidance revision, we are making decisions to the long-term to ensure that we're taking the necessary actions to drive sustainable growth and margin improvement in the future.", "With that, I'll hand it back over to you, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Kathy. I want to get to your questions so I'll summarize quickly. Although earnings met expectations, it was a challenging quarter. As Kathy detailed a moment ago, we are lowering our full year guidance. We know we have work to do to achieve sustainable long-term success. I'm confident in our business strategy, our strong portfolio, and our ability to succeed in the many industries that we serve. Going forward, in Services, we are focused on revenue and margin expansion. Improved signings and executing on our new operating model will help us there.", "Document Technology continues to execute well and we remain focused on leading in the most attractive segments of the market. Overall, we anticipate positive results from the changes that we've made and I'm certain that the actions that we're taking today will ensure a healthy Xerox for tomorrow and beyond.", "So thank you for listening and now I'll turn it over to Leslie.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Kathy today is Bob Zapfel, Head of our Services business. Also let me point out we that have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck. They provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I'd ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Bill Shope from Goldman Sachs.", "William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, great. Thank you. I have a question on the Services segment in general. The volatility and the unexpected shortfalls we've seen on Services margins has obviously been a problem for some time now for, different reasons for different quarters. But I guess when we look at this quarter specifically and the cost overruns for the California case, what safeguards are being put in place to ensure that we don't see this happen again with other contracts that maybe we can't see from the outside? And why aren't we seeing more substantial restructuring to deal with what appears to be a pretty uncertain margin path of this business overall?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Okay. Bill, it's Bob. Let me start. So relative to \u2013 actions relative to our Enterprise platform with Government Healthcare, we are taking a number of actions to try to drive improved visibility and predictability there. We're increasing the leadership focus and we've added additional external talent. These are five accounts. So this is not across our broad portfolio. This is the implementation of a new system and in the five states we talked about at the investor conference, we've added project management oversight in each of these projects to try to drive better predictability.", "We're working to consolidate the customized instances into a standardized platform that would then be less costly to implement and manage going forward. We're lining up additional partners to help us with software development integration capability and trying to better leverage low cost resources for platform development. And we're pursuing add-on work with a number of these clients to give us some incremental revenue.", "Relative to your question on restructuring, we were down 2,000 people from the end of the fourth quarter to the end of the first quarter in our Services business overall. So we're just trying to manage to drive improved productivity broadly across our Services portfolio.", "William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "If I could just add onto that, when we look at sort of the metrics you're judging this stabilization by, I mean is this something that you expect by the time we get to 2016 we're back on track? Obviously, we saw your full-year margin guidance, so we get some color on the path you're looking at for this year. But sort of what are you sort of putting in front of you as targets to get back on track and show that some of these safeguards are actually bearing fruit?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "So overall, in terms of some of the incremental actions that we're taking to make sure that we've fully considered what's going to be needed, we've obviously made more room in our margin guidance. So Health Enterprise costs generally expected to also be a year-over-year headwind for us in the second quarter. We've added additional, both financial management resources and expanded the financial teams in this area that sit over the accounts, specifically in California, which is where we had the big adjustment for the quarter.", "As we look out to 2016, the most important influence is getting more and more of these implementations under our belt, right? So Bob mentioned, we have five accounts, two have already been implemented, another one will be implemented next year. So getting these implementations under our belt where the contracts were signed, three plus years ago is what we really need to get behind us. And you can see that we've taken big adjustments on California to really reflect the expectation of higher go-forward costs.", "William Charles Shope - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much. I have another Services oriented question. Bob, sort of taking a step back because in the last question you discussed a lot on the healthcare side. Can you talk a bit about what you're seeing in the other parts of the business, and how you're sort of thinking about some of those areas in terms of growth and margin opportunity once we sort of get through this healthcare issue? And then I have a question on acquisitions. Thanks.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Thanks, Shannon. Yes, I would say, as you and others have got good visibility to, we've moved to this new industry go-to-market and global capability model. And I would say that early indications are very positive on both elements of that. So we're finding \u2013 the pipeline data doesn't look great quarter-to-quarter, but we found that from January, February, March, we had an improved pipeline as we put new resources in place. We bolstered up the sales team that we think will drive to improvements in our second-half results. In the global capability model, if you think back to our kind of margin improvement track, we think we're going get very good yield out of that. So overall, I would say that we've got positive signs relative to the model in general. And the customer feedback has largely been favorable.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay. And then can you talk a bit about \u2013 I'm not sure who wants to take it, but from an acquisition standpoint, $900 million, you've talked about you made a very small acquisition during the first quarter. What kind of acquisitions, sort of what size, I mean is this something where we can actually assume it will get done this year because I know you're talking about pushing cash now into 2016. I'm just looking at with the stock down double-digits right now, perhaps share repurchase might be a better use of cash? Or just how are you sort of thinking about cash as we go forward here? Thank you.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So this is Kathy. Overall, if you look at our activity kind of year-over-year, I would describe us as having more activity this year than last year. Now, activity doesn't always immediately translate into getting things done. But that activity has been more focused on, I think, what I described on our last call, as chunkier-sized deals, right? So we are looking to not just do the deal size of the one deal that we did this quarter, but looking at things that are a little larger which can make more of a difference for us.", "We're targeting specific areas. I mean, when you look across our portfolio, we've got a great business in Commercial Healthcare. There are places we'd like to continue to build out that business. Transportation is an area of target for us. We've talked about the continued move into workflow within our Document Outsourcing group; so that's an area. And then as we look to continue to expand internationally, we do need a bigger footprint and acquisitions can help us in that space as well. So they're, as you can imagine, tough to call, it's tough to call in which quarter are we actually going land things. But we're certainly generating more activity and looking to do larger deals.", "And then in the second part of your question, so what about share repurchases, we are committed to doing about $1 billion of share repurchases this year. We know M&A timing is hard to call. It's important for us as we continue to look at evolving our portfolio. And so if we don't spend the $900 million, we will roll it over into next year.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Just on the healthcare side. I just I guess heard the incremental $30 million in spend. I guess that was on top of the $20 million maybe last year. So I'm just curious in the hindsight here, is this just \u2013 I heard the platform implementation issues you called out. But in hindsight, was it a missed pricing issue just thinking about what went wrong, I get, again, the implementation problems but could this have been resolved if you had priced these contracts differently? And then I just want to pull that forward into New York and just being confident here that you have a good line of sight into the ramp there at the price that you wanted?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. And so if you look at the situation in California which triggered the adjustment that we took this quarter, we had made a decision with the state of California to do this in a staged implementation rather than a single cutover, right, and that caused us to have to basically kind of restage and rework our project plan. As we got into the further details of what that was going to cost, right, the cost for the overall implementation went up. And that triggered us to have to take an adjustment this quarter. So we scrubbed much further what that project plan was going to look like. It's the right answer for the clients and for us to do a staged implementation. It reduces the risk of execution. But at the end of the day, we now understand that it's going to cost more. And this is a contract that was signed years, years ago and in advance of our standard platform being completed.", "If I contrast that then because you asked about New York, New York is very different because New York we actually bid a standard contract, right. And in addition to bidding a standard contract, we were awarded this contract last May. We started standing up resources towards the end of the third quarter in order to really get us on a right track with New York, so we're very excited about New York. And it's a different situation than I'll say the legacy implementations that we had pre-New York.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "If I would just add on New York, I think the dominant difference is that we were able to bid an already-working system which as opposed to what we did in the other states we hadn't already completed the core software asset. And as Kathy mentioned, we have been in front of the contract being finalized. We have been investing to ensure a very rapid start, which on the other implementations we didn't start until after the contract was signed. So we're very optimistic that we're well positioned to deliver well both for New York and for our shareholders with that opportunity.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We were focused on making sure that California for sure, but New York very specifically in this conversation starts well and we \u2013 before we had revenue, knowing that we were investing before we had revenue, we took that risk because it's really important. The long game here is very important to keep an eye on. And so we took a hit in the quarter for New York as well because we didn't get it signed in the quarter but it's the right thing to do, but we got signed, obviously after the quarter.", "Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just \u2013 no, that's good to know. Just two quick follow-ups just on the Florida Tolling, I know there were some disputes in the past on that. Is that getting closer to being done? Sounds like it could happen in the second quarter. And then just any client feedback on the ITO divestiture in terms of feedback. Just any update there would be great. Thank you.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Yes. On Florida, it is getting closer. It is not yet complete, but it is getting closer. And on the ITO, the ITO transaction with Atos, the feedback has been very positive. The consent process that both for the pure IT outsourcing clients and for the large volume of clients that we have BPO relationships with that then Atos will become a subsidiary provider has also gone very well. So we're pleased with that.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks very much. And I know a lot of the question has been on the Services. Seeing how that's the strategy of your company and really one of the key go-forward vehicles, I think it's very appropriate. And so when we think about the new reset to goals of operating margins of 8.5% to 9%, previously you've said your long-term goal is 10% to 12%. Is that still valid? Has that been now you'll have to revisit that altogether? And if so, what timeline should we think? I think most people think of long-term as kind of two years or three years. You can actually reach it. It's not some far-flung dream out there. So can you address that please?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Well, we're not going to do the \u2013 all of the normal guidance stuff for next year until the November conference. But my view is clearly that that long-term goal is still our target. So I don't add. There's nothing that I've \u2013 we're disappointed with our operating performance, and we've shared that. But I do not have a view that that's not an attainable long-term margin perspective for us with the set of actions that we're taking relative to portfolio management, go-to-market by industry global capabilities. So I don't expect us to change our view on that.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And if I may, I'll just add that we're talking long-term in my lifetime. And I mean that really, really clearly. We definitely take a step to the side today and this year, but getting to 10% to 12% is something that we can do in the foreseeable future, in the near-term not in the long-term.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. And then my follow up is regarding the margins of 8.5% to 9%, am I correct that folds in the New York, the California, the not-yet-closed Florida but likely to close contract? And is there anything about accounting, Kathy, that we need to be aware of like percentage of completion versus booking upfront costs to invest today that have been in a few quarters just the way you recognize the profitability of it in a couple quarters becomes less risky of another disappointment like we saw today?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, so as much as I don't like to talk about accounting on these calls, I'm happy to take a little bit of diversion to do that. I mentioned we took an adjustment for California. So when we're implementing the platform, we are using percent of completion accounting. Right? And in that case, as we got in and did the more detailed planning for the now phased implementation and costed out that more detailed plan, that's what triggered us to take the adjustment in the quarter. That adjustment in the quarter is not all cash that kind of lands in the quarter. Right? That's a software platform that we'll be delivering over the course of this year and next kind of through these stages. So I would call that a pretty isolated adjustment, not the kind of adjustment that we would expect we'd be taking on an ongoing basis.", "And it's part of the reason earlier I talked about the fact that this area gets less risky for us as we complete more and more of these implementations with the states where we signed contracts three plus years ago. Once we get beyond the implementation, right, then the economics move to, I'll call it, the regular Medicaid transaction processing. Right? And in addition to that, we typically, and even in the couple of clients that we've already cut over with the new platform, we typically have the opportunity to then do add-on things and get additional revenue from those clients, which we have been successfully doing and will continue to do.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "And just on other part of your question, so New York and Florida are contemplated then within the guidance that we've shared.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. A question for both Ursula and Kathy. This last round of investments in Services and prior investments in Services have been predominantly focused on Government Healthcare. Strategically, Ursula, when you think about returns on investment, how do you think about the long-term opportunity in Government Healthcare and when can we begin to see returns from these investments in terms of incremental revenues and profits? And then, Kathy, related to healthcare expenses, how do you think about the staging of expenses related to the New York contract, and in light of potential unforeseen investments, does the updated guidance range build in room for multiple scenarios? And then I have a follow-up.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so the first part of the question is important for you to ask and for us to get out on this call, and just lay a foundation, Government Healthcare is something that, I think, that Bob said earlier, we've been in for more than 40 years. And it is a business that will be around and growing with a lot of focus because of the aging population, regulation changes in the United States, you know, all of the foundational elements. We make, in this business, above average margins. This is above average Services margins in this business. It's important to know that. And that we are very successful and liked by our clients. We do business in many, many states. We service millions of recipients benefit from those states. And it's a very profitable business for us.", "Once we get past laying down the platform, which is really complicated, and what we did for good, for better, for ugly, but the facts are that we actually implemented a brand new platform in these five states that readies us for the future of aging and new regulation et cetera. It's been more challenging then even I would like for it to be, but it is one that with many \u2013 with continuous review we keep coming down on the fact that this is a good business, and a business that can be profitable for sure. It is already in the historic counts and we just have to make it that way in the new accounts.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "And I have one quick add and I'll get to your question with regard to sort of staging on the Health Enterprise accounts. Overall, when we talk about investments in Services outside of our Government Healthcare group, we're investing in things like sales leadership, training, tools, new offerings, this shift to our new industry business group sort of vertical approach in adding leadership in there. So when we talk about investments it's clearly outside of the Government Healthcare solution business as well.", "With regard to kind of the staging, so clearly the first quarter, we took a big adjustment in California. As I described that's a pretty isolated instance. If I look over 2015 for sort of the pattern of what we're expecting in the Health Enterprise accounts, I would describe this as first half sort of heavy on incremental costs and expecting in the second half that we're actually going to get a reasonable amount of pickup. Now it's still going be a drag on a full year basis. Right? So if you look at the adjustment that we made overall to our margins, originally when we gave guidance back in November, we said we thought we were going to get 25 basis points to 50 basis points largely candidly from these Health Enterprise accounts improving. Right?", "I would describe that now on a full year basis embedded in our guidance is taking into consideration we might actually see a little bit of dilution overall on our margins for the year. So we thought \u2013 we think as we've revised our guidance that we've really taken into consideration that some of these things are tough to call. They're pretty complicated projects. And we need to make sure that we have room if there's any changes and we've taken that into account.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "That's helpful.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Kathy said in her \u2013 sorry \u2013 I think Kathy said in her notes that without the health accounts in the first quarter we would have been up 10 basis points in margin. And this year, as Kathy said, we don't \u2013 we expected 25 basis points to 50 basis points of improvement so our margin expansion to come from Health Enterprises. As she said again I'm just repeating it, so we can actually get it clear. That will not happen; that 25 basis points to 50 basis points will not happen. It will probably be a little bit of a headwind for us in 2015 not a tailwind. And so the margin adjustment that we've taken for the full company and for Services comprehends that pressure that we're not going to make the progress that we wanted to make in Government Health from a financial perspective. The great news about this operationally is that we are doing fairly well, I think, across all of the accounts, there's some struggles in maybe one, but we're doing fairly well operationally across these accounts.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman from BMO Capital Markets.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Bob. For you, please. If you could talk a little bit about the new business signings away from New York and Florida, continues to trend weak. And if you could just talk about why you think the new business signings down 26% year-over-year and 17% trailing 12 months. Why they're weak? And what's the plan to try to right that ship?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Okay. Thanks, Keith. So they're weak for a couple of reasons. I mean, not getting the bigger deals is the primary cause. So you look on a trailing 12-month basis and having \u2013 it's not just not having New York or Florida in the compare, but not having anything that's really substantially large deal, certainly hurts those trailing 12 months compares. Going forward, obviously, we expect both of those, New York being finalized, and Florida, that will help our dynamics through the second quarter.", "And I think in the second-half of the year, the changes that we've made relative to the industry go-to-market model, we have been beefing up the sales force, we're \u2013 90% of the key sales positions now filled. That's up from where we were at the time of the investor conference. We expect to get the improvement in the second-half coming from the industry go-to-market model, the investments that we've made in leadership positions and the investments that we've made in increasing our sales capacity.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay. The corollary is \u2013 or the follow-on question is, are you becoming more concentrated? If you're relying more on the New York MMIS deal and the Florida Toll roads as you look out over the course of the year, it would seem to suggest more concentration. Therefore, if there's any issues in those contracts or other large deals from a profitability, does it put you more at risk for future margin-related issues because, in fact, you're getting more concentration in your customer base without the new business signings?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Well, I would say that if you look at having two deals of that size in your overall signings portfolio, that is not an atypical level of concentration. So I mean, again, I think the weakness over a trailing 12-month is not having anything big in that set of signings. When we move and both grow the smaller deal component and have those in what's been signed, that would be to me a more typical kind of mix of signings. So I don't think \u2013 obviously, when you add big clients, then that individual client is kind of a bigger share of your revenue stream. But from an overall signings mix, no, I don't think a portfolio for the year that would include Florida, New York and then the rest of our book of business would be more concentrated than 2012, 2013 kind of what our historical rate's been.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah. And I would just add onto that, Keith. I mean, if you put those two aside and we just looked at the composition of our signings kind of up until this point in time, I would describe our book of signings as very diversified across our industry vertical.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "So the addition of these two contracts doesn't really sort of sway things really materially across the portfolio.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Yeah, both diversified across our industry verticals and across our offering. So maybe wrongly, but this is not a big worry for us at this point in terms of concentration risk of where our signings come from.", "Keith F. Bachman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Okay.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. Just two if I could, Kathy and maybe Ursula. The first one is, could you list order of magnitude on the $0.05 guide down? How much comes from each of the factors from FX and then from Services revenue and from the cost side of the Services equation? And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. So overall, in terms of the $0.05, I would characterize most of it as coming from the additional costs that we're seeing in the Health Enterprise accounts. With regard to FX, if I look at how rates changed, kind of where we are today versus the last time we were on this call in January, the biggest change that we saw was in the euro, which has weakened by about 4%. It was partially offset by the yen weakening, kind of which helps us a little. And so net-net, I would say, that's a negative, but it's not kind of materially a negative. And then I would say, very modestly, a little bit lighter on productivity relative to investment. So how that ramps over the course of the year for us is a little bit lighter. But the overwhelming majority of the $0.05 move is for the additional costs we're anticipating in the Health Enterprise platform implementation.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Got it. Thanks, Kathy. That's helpful. And then to that end, just with regards to the dynamic that you're seeing from Health Enterprise platform, Kathy, you mentioned that the biggest \u2013 the best way to sort of handle the situation is just to get the other three stood up and running and normalized. Does that mean that you guys could continue to be at risk? Or I guess what I want to \u2013 the way to ask it maybe is, can you provide us the appropriate context of which to sort of gauge, and how you're gauging, what the risk to the cost side ongoingly has given that you still have three that stand up and that the contract...", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "...was signed previously?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. We have one that's cutting over later this year, I mean we're pretty close on it.", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Right.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "And so we're pretty close to the finish line on that one. And the closer you get to the finish line, basically, the less risk you have. We talked about California and we made a big adjustment for California. Last year, we actually made an adjustment for the one other state that hasn't been cut over yet, so we had sort of resized what we thought our cost expectations were going to be. So I would characterize as we've already taken a hit on California, we've adjusted the other state that hasn't yet been implemented and we're close on the one that we're going to cut over this year.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And New York doesn't have the same type of risks. So we think that we've gotten most of the ordinary course of business contract rollout costs associated with the rollout comprehended.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Okay, got it. Got it. Thanks.", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I guess I'll pig pile on MMIS for a question. I've seen a number of different comments out in the press about it being on a pretty aggressive timeline. So, first of all, congratulations on getting it finally across the goal line. And then as we think about the schedule going forward and that it may be an aggressive schedule, I guess the question is, how does that timeline compare to, I guess, comparable contracts? And I know you've been pre-spending, but what sort of kind of, I guess, benchmarks do we need to consider going forward, as you finally start to implement the contract?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Yeah, this is Bob. So let me try to address that. So it is a shorter time line than historic contracts, that's the reason we started investing more than six months into advance. So we \u2013 if you measured the timeline from date of finalization, it's shorter. If you measured the timeline from date that we started pre-investing, it's aggressive, but reasonable. And we think that, again, it's a different situation in our view compared to the ones that we have previously done with the Health Enterprise platform because we are starting from a working code base rather than starting from something that was still in design. So it's a \u2013 it \u2013 while it is a more aggressive time period than you might look at some historical artifacts, the combination of both those two factors, starting in advance and working off an existing software asset, we believe that makes it a timeline that we'll be able to achieve for the state.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So, Bob, how does that match up with any kind of issues you might have had with previous contracts where you've -maybe you've already had this code base already developed? I mean previously, have most of the contracts been on the application development side? Or has it been on back-end integration? Or what kind of gives you the confidence that in an aggressive time line you can meet those goals?", "Robert K. Zapfel - Executive Vice President, President-Xerox Services", "Yeah, I'm sorry, Brian. So really the previous contracts we have not yet completed the code base. So there's been a three-year-plus gap between the last one and now in New York. So the book of business that we signed previously, we had some of the code base solidified, but some of it's still, if you will, in design mode. And for New York, it's not as though we don't have some level of customization to do. It's not just taking a software asset and making no modifications or changes to it. But it is largely often existing proven code base that we're running in one of the other states.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Maybe I can sneak one in on the printing side of the business. I guess bookings seem a little weak. And I think you've noted on the previous quarter that we're kind of caught a little bit of a product upgrade cycle. I guess maybe can we put that in context of what to expect for growth there through the rest of the year given the product cycle and that there was only a little bit in last quarter, and bookings seemed a little bit light this Q?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, so what I would say is as you look at that, our expectations as we head into the second quarter is that we'll see a little bit better performance overall on high-end. That was weak in the first quarter. It's a place of, I'd say, generally strength for us from a product offering perspective and we also have other new products coming out in the second half in that area. And we certainly expect, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that Entry's going to continue to be weak. We expect it'll, I'll call it, modestly improve with new products helping but it's a big DMO-centric area. And DMO markets just continue to be weak economically.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "I think we have time for one last question, please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question for today comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha from Credit Suisse.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Thank you. I know this has been asked in different ways. I just have a broad question on Services which is, if we go back over a long period of time, I think once upon a time Xerox stock just might...", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Kulbinder, Kulbinder, I think you need to speak up. It's very difficult to hear you.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hi. Can you hear me now?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hello?", "Kathryn Mikells - Corporate Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay. Sorry about that. My question is over a long period of time Xerox once thought this Services business could do margins of almost 12%. We're a long way from that now. And I guess just is there anything more structural at hand here over the longer term competitive or otherwise, and is there any more kind of deeper strategic view going on so that we don't have these kind of continuous issues whether it's been a gradual step-down over many years, like whether it's addressing the cost base, rethinking the strategies, any of that going on? Or do you see this very much as just a kind of a normal onetime hit in 2015 from the Enterprise Health accounts? Many thanks.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, Kulbinder, it's a good question. I think a good last question as well. We obviously spend \u2013 leadership team, the board, we spend a lot of time looking at performance versus strategy to make sure that the loop is continually closed, and that we are on the right stack of mail.", "Separating operational challenges are we on the right stack of mail for 10% to 12% margins, revenue growth overall, and being valuable to our clients. And the answer is, yes. We still believe that the fundamental strategy of diversified Services portfolio globalized, which we are still working on doing, that's supported by a good level of acquisitions in the areas that we're in. We are doing portfolio management and trimming out things that we're not great at and investing in areas that we're really good. That strategy still holds.", "Document Technology as a good cash generator, good base for us to grow Services from. Also that strategy still holds. So I think with \u2013 we look at it all the time. We look at it against our financial goals and against our capabilities. We can get to 10% to 12% margins for sure. Government Healthcare is a place that we have to continue to focus and continue to improve. And hopefully not talk about a whole lot as we go on. We have to just get this stuff behind us.", "New York, we think we have a good start. We have these five contracts et cetera, et cetera. So Government Health is the place that we're spending a lot of time on this call, and rightfully so. But the rest of the mix of the business that we have in the remainder of the strategy is one that absolutely still holds water and still works for us. And so \u2013 and I think it will work for the shareholders over time and that's what we're focused on.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "With that, I think I can actually transition to a close. And let me just thank all of you for taking the time to ask questions and listen to the call. We're working hard to advance our business objectives in 2015 and beyond.", "Leslie F. Varon - Vice President-Finance & Controller", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call for today. If you have any further questioning, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team.", "Operator", "Thank you.

She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today\u2019s conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions]", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning and thank you for joining our call. Today, we are announcing significant actions that will define the next chapter of our company. We will spend much of the call today discussing our plans to separate into two strong independent market-leading companies. We will also discuss the multiyear strategic transformation program announced today. And of course, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results and 2016 guidance.", "Let me begin with our plan to dramatically change the way that we generate shareholder value. Today, we announced that the comprehensive structural review begun in October has been completed. The review has been a top priority for our Board of Directors and the executive team. We engaged outside advisers, including independent advisers to the Board in this process. It was a robust assessment of options for the company\u2019s portfolio and capital allocation that would best position the company to maximize shareholder value. It became clear through this analysis that the benefits of separation outweighed the benefits of maintaining the current structure.", "The Board unanimously agreed that the optimal path forward for Xerox is to become two market-leading focused publicly traded companies. We are confident this is the highest value creating opportunity for our shareholders, for our clients and employees. These companies will both be significant Fortune 500 scale companies and leaders in their markets, one comprising our Business Process Outsourcing business; the other, our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses.", "Document Technology, with 2015 revenue of $11 billion, will continue to lead the document management and document outsourcing market, leveraging its superior technology, solutions and innovation capabilities. BPO, with 2015 revenue of $7 billion, and already a leader in the growing market, will continue to pursue growth opportunities by capitalizing on its deep industry expertise, market-leading automation solutions and track record of global delivery excellence. I will discuss unique strengths, top line financial profiles and growth opportunities of the two companies in more detail shortly.", "But first, let me talk about the compelling rationale that exists behind the decision to separate these companies. We have two strong businesses each facing different market and client realities. Document Technology faces modest secular declines in its markets while BPO participates in the growing, but rapidly evolving market. The businesses have distinct operating models and cash flow characteristics and very different growth drivers and competition. The Document Technology business is one in which operational discipline and the commitment to transformative productivity is vital to sustaining quality and managing cost in an increasingly interconnected digital world. Doing that right creates strong profitability and cash flow that can be returned to shareholders and invested in selected growth opportunities.", "BPO, on the other hand, needs to be highly adaptive, able to innovate and adopt technology quickly and shift its portfolio to address the fast changing needs of its clients. We are seeing how new technologies like Software-as-a-Service and robotic process automation are changing the way that services are delivered. Additionally, clients are requiring deep analytics for operational insight and greater personalization. The BPO market is growing at a greater than 5% rate and the majority of the revenue streams are recurring. Based on this, we concluded that these businesses will be stronger and able to create more value for shareholders, clients and employees as independent companies.", "We are creating two companies that will be market leaders, benefiting from enhanced strategic and operational focus, distinct and clear financial profiles and capital allocation policies can simplify organization structures. As standalone companies, they will have compelling investment cases and be better positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities and expand margins and market share. We see the BPO company as one focused on revenue growth, margin expansion and disciplined investments in attractive growing markets. Document Technology will leverage its track record of market leadership and strong cash flow generation to a sustained and investment grade rating and shareholder-friendly capital allocation plan.", "Let\u2019s look at more closely at each company. The Document Technology company will be the global leader in a $90 billion document management and document outsourcing market with the presence in approximately 180 countries. We have a broad portfolio of products and are the equipment revenue market share leader. Our managed print services offerings are widely recognized as best-of-breed by customers and industry analysts. Despite secular decline in the printing industry, our Document Technology business remains highly profitable with annuity driven revenue representing more than 70% of our sales. Through relentless cost discipline, this business generates strong and consistent cash flows that allow us to make strategic investments to generate, to penetrate higher growth markets such as Aqueous inkjet, high-end color printing, managed print services and workflow.", "BPO is a leading enterprise for the next-generation of Business Process Outsourcing with $7 billion in revenues. In this business, we enjoyed the number two position in market share in an industry that is expanding by more than 5% annually. We are advantaged with differentiated capabilities and help clients improve their flow of work, we bring expertise in managing transaction intensive business processes and are applying new innovations to automation solutions.", "We have market-leading positions in healthcare, transportation, public sector and a range of other industries. Our high recurring revenue and high renewal rates reinforce our confidence in our ability to grow market share and expand margins going forward. We are very excited about the opportunities ahead of us for these two businesses. With increased strategic focus, we can capitalize on their unique strength and capture the value creation opportunities that we see in each of them. ", "In conjunction with the separation announcement, we have also launched a strategic transformation program, targeting incremental savings of $600 million over 3 years. This brings our total cumulative savings target to $2.4 billion during this period, which includes ongoing productivity initiatives.", "In 2016, we expect a total of $700 million in annualized savings. The plan is companywide and will include a thorough review of how we work and how we operate. Bottom line, we are not only optimizing our portfolio and capital structure, we are also driving a strategic transformation. This will improve our competitive position and help expand margins in both our businesses during the separation process and beyond.", "Our employees will benefit from working for industry leaders with streamlined structures and fast decision-making. The companies will have greater flexibility to align employee incentives and rewards to business performance. For clients, each company will maintain its leading service delivery and innovation excellence, but will be able to more quickly respond to market forces and client needs through focus and agility. And for investors, focus to companies with optimized capital structures and capital allocation policies to present distinct and compelling investment cases and will be well-positioned to deliver value.", "Let me spend a moment on the separation process itself. We are committed to executing the strategic actions seamlessly in the shortest possible timeframe. The separation is expected to be completed by the end of 2016, subject to customary conditions. We expect that the transaction to be U.S. federal tax free for our shareholders. During the process, we will remain focused on our clients, partners, suppliers and employees and delivering strong financial results. There are of course, a series of key milestones that we will need to achieve in the upcoming months to complete the transaction and we will keep you updated on our progress. And as you read this morning, Xerox entered into an agreement with Carl Icahn, related to the governance of the BPO company following the planned separation. Details are included in the 8-K that we filed today.", "Now let me make a few brief comments on the fourth quarter before turning over to Leslie for a detailed results discussion. We delivered strong performance in the face of challenging market conditions. Highlights were; revenue of $4.7 billion in the quarter, down 5% in constant currency year-over-year, annuity revenue was 83% of total revenue, adjusted EPS of $0.32, above our expectation and $0.27 on a GAAP basis, sequential increase in operating margin to 9.2%, strong cash flow generation of $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the full year. The changes we have made to the Services operating model are beginning to pay off as demonstrated by sequential margin improvement and double-digit year-over-year signings growth. Document Technology was the industry leader for the 24th consecutive quarter and through focus on performance and productivity, maintained its strong margins. Over the course of 2015, we returned $1.6 billion to shareholders in the form of $1.3 billion in share buybacks and over $300 million in dividends. We have increased our annual dividends by 11% to $0.31 per share, the highest level since 2000 beginning with a dividend payable April 2016.", "Leslie will discuss our 2016 guidance and some changes that we will make in our reporting. We expect 2016 to be a strong year for Xerox as well as a foundational year for the two companies. Now I will turn it over to Leslie.", "Leslie Varon", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning everyone. I will start by walking through our results and then covering 2016 guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. In summary, we delivered solid results in quarter four. Services came in above our expectations, driven by good sequential margin improvement. Document Technology revenue was weaker than anticipated, primarily driven by lower supply sales, but margin remained in the middle of our range reflecting our ongoing cost discipline and business model flexibility. Q4 cash flow as anticipated was seasonally strong and drove $1.6 billion of full year operating cash flow resulting in a healthy ending cash balance of $1.4 billion. During the year, we returned a substantial amount of cash to our shareholders with $1.3 billion in share repurchases and $326 million in dividends.", "Turning to the earnings slide, I will walk through the income statement. Revenue in the quarter was down 8% at actual currency and 5% at constant currency. Currency cost us approximately $150 million on the top line. Services\u2019 top line was flat at constant currency, helped by solid 3% growth in Document Outsourcing, offsetting a 2% decline in BPO. Document Technology declined 10% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I will speak more about the drivers when I review the segments. Gross margin of 31.3% was down 80 basis points year-over-year, but up 40 basis points sequentially. Sequential improvement was driven by Services, while the year-over-year decline was driven by Document Technology as well as a greater mix of services, which carries a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $5 million year-over-year and SAG was down $59 million or 6%. Good expense reductions in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset revenue declines, so operating margin of 9.2% was down 120 basis points year-over-year and operating profit declined 18%.", "Adjusted other net expense was down year-over-year, driven by lower restructuring costs as anticipated in our quarter four guidance. Equity income was $32 million in the quarter, down $9 million year-over-year, reflecting lower profits in Fuji Xerox driven in part by the continued negative impact of translation currency. Our quarter four adjusted tax rate of 21% was below our guidance of 25% to 27%, benefiting our earnings by about $0.02 and reflecting the impact of recent U.S. tax legislation that extends R&D tax credits. Bottom line, despite revenue headwinds, we delivered solid Q4 adjusted earnings of $0.32.", "Moving on to our Services results, while many of the headwinds we have highlighted in the past continue, the benefits of the new operating model are beginning to be realized. Services revenue declined 3% and was flat at constant currency, consistent with both Q3 and full year performance. BPO was down 2% as a result of lower new contract ramp from softer signings in earlier quarters and our decision last quarter to reduce our financial risk and not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementation in Montana and California. Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 3%, driven by strong Xerox Partner print services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in enterprise accounts following continued good signings.", "In terms of the opportunity ahead, total signings in the quarter were up 26% year-over-year and 8% for the trailing 12 months. New business signings were up 22% year-over-year in quarter four. This really strong growth includes the Florida tolling contract. We are pleased to close on this contract and begin implementing a comprehensive tolling solution that leverages our best-in-class proven Vector tolling platform. Excluding the Florida contract, new business signings were up 10% in quarter four, so a very good signings quarter. Our renewal rate in the quarter was 78%, below our 85% to 90% target range and reflects in part, one larger loss renewal opportunity, which would have been financially unattractive.", "Services segment margin was 9.4%, down 40 basis points year-over-year, but up 130 basis points sequentially and above our 9% Q4 margin expectation. The set of services decisions and actions we implemented last year are beginning to deliver better results. We have recognized that we still have work to do. First, to continue the grow signings and translate that into revenue growth. Second, to improve our business mix with a greater proportion of our revenue from higher value offerings. And finally, to capture additional efficiency, including streamlining and automating more of our delivery capabilities.", "I will now turn to Document Technology. Revenue in the quarter was down 10% at constant currency with the additional quarter four weakness coming from lower U.S. supply sales, driven in large part by channel dynamics. For the full year, revenue was down 8%, below our initial 2015 expectation of a mid single-digit decline. The largest driver was a developing markets weakness throughout the year. The Document Technology revenue decline is almost half when the growth from Document Outsourcing is included along with Document Technology. Activity in the quarter was mixed with good growth in a number of color segments, partially offset by the lapping of prior year product launches in areas such as entry production color.", "Overall, 2015 was a lighter product introduction year and we look forward to more launches in 2016 starting this quarter with a broad office product refresh following \u2013 followed by a number of exciting production printing announcements we will be making at Drupa, the printing trade show which occurs every 4 years in Germany. Document Technology margin of 11.8% was in line with our full year guidance of 11% to 13%. Ongoing disciplined cost base management and the flexibility of our business model we are able to partially offset the higher revenue decline, negative mix from lower supplies and higher pension expense.", "Moving to cash flow, we had a strong post to the year for operating cash flow and a very good full year for free cash flow, which was $1.3 billion. This enables us to continue to invest in select growth opportunities and return value to shareholders through repurchases and dividends.", "Cash from operations was $878 million in the quarter and $1.6 billion for the year in line with our full year guidance. Q4 cash generation was roughly flat to the prior year and reflected higher working capital contribution, higher discretionary pension contribution and normal strong quarter four seasonality. Investing cash flows were $19 million used with $80 million spent on CapEx and $9 million on acquisitions partially offset by proceeds from surplus property sales. Cash flow from financing was a $278 million used, including debt reduction of $199 million and $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of quarter four was $1.4 billion providing us with flexibility as we enter 2016.", "Turning to our capital structure, we ended quarter four with $7.4 billion in debt, a $200 million reduction in the fourth quarter and a $374 million reduction for the year, consistent with our expectations. Applying 7 to 1 leverage on customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter four was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment grade credit rating.", "Turning to capital allocation, 2015 was another year of strong capital returns to shareholders. We repurchased 1.3 billion in shares, resulting in almost 10% reduction in shares outstanding. We also delivered $326 million in dividends, which included a 12% per share increase to the common stock dividend. Over four years, we have almost doubled our common stock dividend when including the 11% increase we announced today. So in total, we have returned over $1.6 billion to our shareholders, greater than free cash flow of $1.3 billion with the incremental capital coming from part of the IPO sale proceeds. We are steadfast in our commitment to return capital to shareholders and be good stewards. And we have a strong track record to backup that commitment having returned greater than 50% of free cash flow to shareholders each year over the past 5 years.", "For 2016, we plan once again to deploy greater than 50% of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase, while balancing our need to manage our debt to a level, which is consistent with our investment grade credit rating. We also intend to support our longer term growth objectives and plan to invest $100 million to $400 million on acquisitions with the focus continuing to be on expanding our capabilities in attractive markets.", "Before reviewing our 2016 guidance, I would like to highlight a few reporting changes we will be making beginning this year. These changes will bring our reporting and guidance practices more in line with our peers. I will briefly summarize the changes and note that we have a full explanation on Slide 25 in the appendix. We will exclude three additional items from adjusted earnings to give a clearer picture of underlying operating performance. These items include restructuring expenses, certain retirement related costs and transaction costs from the planned separation and strategic transformation. Retirement related costs will also be adjusted out of our segment results and we are moving to student loan business that we are running off from the services segment to the other segment.", "Finally starting in 2016, we will include developing markets within our constant currency calculations to give a truer picture of our constant currency revenue performance. We have additional information on these reporting changes in the appendix, including revised results for 2015 that will provide a comparable basis for 2016.", "Moving to our 2016 guidance on this basis, we anticipate full year constant currency revenue to decline 2% to 4% with flat to 3% growth in services more than offset by declines of 5% to 7% in Document Technology. At January 15 spot rates we anticipate a negative currency impact on revenue of 1% to 2% for the full year with a higher impact in the first half than the second. Considering the uncertain macro environment, we don\u2019t expect our revenue to deviate substantially from trend, but we do expect modest improvement in both segments as we move through the year and lap the onset of some headwinds in both Document Technology and Services. We expect Document Technology margin to be roughly in line with 2015, that\u2019s within a 12% to 14% range, excluding retirement related costs. We expect Services margin to improve and be in a range of 8% to 9.5%. Adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 represents a 3% to 12% growth from 2015.", "Finally, we expect to generate operating cash flow of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion and invest $300 million in CapEx, yielding $1 billion to $1.2 billion in free cash flow. This guidance is below 2015 cash flow as it includes settlement outflows associated with our decision last quarter to not fully complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations in Montana and California, as well as a higher than normal level of restructuring as we implement our strategic transformation program. Transactional-related costs associated with the separation are still being estimated and aren\u2019t yet reflected in our cash flow or GAAP earnings guidance.", "For quarter one, we expect adjusted earnings per share between $0.21 and $0.24. So to summarize for quarter one and full year 2016, we have set achievable objectives that reflect first, improvement in the business tied to the actions and investments we have made over the past year; second, prudent expectations given economic uncertainties and headwinds; and finally, continued investment in the business and implementation of the first year of strategic transformation activities that will further prepare the Document Technology and BPO businesses to be strong, standalone companies.", "With that, I will hand it back to Ursula to wrap up.", "Ursula Burns", "Thanks, Leslie. Let me recap and reinforce a few key points. First, this is an executive team committed to enhancing value for Xerox shareholders. And with the support of our board, we are taking bold steps to do that by separating into two companies and undertaking a transformative productivity and efficiency program. Second, the plan to separate into two strong independent companies is the right step forward for Xerox as each company will benefit from enhanced focus and lower cost structure and an appropriate capital structure. Each will have the resources and focus needed to capitalize on unique growth opportunities and an operating model and cash flow characteristics to create value and drive in this sector.", "Finally, we are fully committed to becoming a much leaner and more efficient organization both at Xerox in 2016 and continuing on at the two companies in the years after. These efforts will dramatically improve the way that we do business. Thank you for joining us today. Our efforts to transform Xerox are underway and we look forward to communicating our progress in the coming months.", "With that, let me turn things over to Jennifer who will open it up for questions.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Ursula. Before we get to your questions for Ursula and Leslie, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck, which provide more financial detail to support today\u2019s presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions, so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "George Tong", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. Ursula, can you provide some examples of how splitting the business can improve execution and drive better services results?", "Ursula Burns", "Hey, George and thanks for the question. I think that there are probably three areas that I can refer to. And there will be a mix between both Services and the Technology business, not only in Services, for sure. The investment profile that we will \u2013 that we have been making and will need to continue to make is to invest more in automation of our Services delivery infrastructure. That investment \u2013 those investment needs obviously compete with other investment needs in our tech business. And we would be able to actually focus those investments more \u2013 pointedly more, just more and it\u2019s a big focus of ours and as the market has changed, we have realized that we have to make more investments there automation, cloud-based services, service-as-a-service offerings, etcetera. Second is on talent, interestingly this is both businesses. The dynamics of these two businesses, one grows, one doesn\u2019t grow that much, one throws off a lot more cash, the other one doesn\u2019t, actually at the leadership level will be able to actually have more refined incentive structures around the leadership of these two companies that aligns very well toward their dynamics and their growth profiles. And the third is around how we operate outside of the United States. It\u2019s one of the areas that we put a lot of energy in our Services business, trying to actually piggyback on the infrastructure of our tech business. That was probably one of the most difficult areas for us to break into. And now we will be able to interestingly enough focus back our tech business on taking care of the tech sector and be very selective in how we expand further outside the United States in our BPO business, three areas of difference.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, George. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Shannon Cross from Cross Research. Your line is now open.", "Shannon Cross", "Thank you. I have one question on the quarter and then one question on the transaction or what you are doing. The first is just on the quarter, can you talk a little bit about the lower supply sales and how we think about that, is that \u2013 was that sort of the distributors or was that usage, what was sort of in there and how are you thinking about supplies and usage as we go through 2016? And then I had a follow-up. Thanks.", "Leslie Varon", "Sure, Shannon. So let me start first of all by reminding everyone that unbundled supplies in Xerox represent just 20% of our Document Technology revenues, different from many of our competitors because we sell so much of our supplies as part of the bundled contract. With regard to the lower supply sales in quarter four, it was in the U.S. and had to do with reseller stocking levels. So what we saw in quarter four was a lower level of stocking at the reseller level than we had in the year ago period. And that typically reflects some combination of the following factors; lower end customer demand, given the fact that we have had weaker equipment sales through that segment earlier this year, reseller cash management and the level of competitive discounts that resellers choose to take advantage of versus the price discounts from the Xerox level. So it was unusually weak for us in quarter four. We do expect better performance in quarter one and going forward. But we expect supplies revenue will continue to be pressured given the lower level of A4 equipment sales. Did you have another question, Shannon?", "Shannon Cross", "Could you hear me?", "Leslie Varon", "Yes.", "Shannon Cross", "Hello, okay. Yes. If you could just help sort of help us walk through, if we think about $1 of earnings for Xerox right now and then we split it and we obviously know that the margin differential and you have given guidance in that between the two businesses. But can you sort of help us walk through on the other line item where you think things will kind of play out, I mean I am getting in sort of $0.70 to printing and $0.30 to BPO, I mean that\u2019s very much a squishy number. But just any color you can give us on that. And then also from a cash flow perspective, how we should think about how cash flow has come from the two businesses because we kind of know what they were like in 2009, but if we can get an idea of sort of how you are thinking about it now, that would be really helpful? Thanks.", "Leslie Varon", "Yes. So Shannon, I will start by saying that more of these details will become clear as we go through the process to separate during the year. So I don\u2019t \u2013 I won\u2019t give you specific answers now. But I will remind you that the margin in the Document Technology segment is higher than the margin in the Services segment. And the margin in the Document Outsourcing portion of the Services segment is above the segment average, which means BPO is obviously below. So that should give you some sense as to the profiles of the margins in the two businesses going forward. With regard to cash flow, I think you know that the Document Technology business and the Document Outsourcing businesses are very cash generative businesses. And the BPO business is less cash generative and is more in an investment and a ramp up growth mode.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks Shannon. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Brian Essex", "Hi, good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if you would give us a little bit more detail on the process that you went through, how these decisions were made. And then if you could follow-up with the management structure that you anticipate as you walk through the transition process, including what we can expect at the very top leadership level, current President like Bob Zapfel and Jeff and how they are going to fit in, as well as on the CFO search side and how you anticipate staffing the financial side of the business?", "Ursula Burns", "Three good questions. Let me start with the process. In October, actually before October, but in October, we spoke to you about undertaking a review \u2013 a structural review that was focused on our portfolio of offerings and our capital allocation structure and process. That was in full swing by the end of October and included our Board \u2013 the entire management team and our Board of Directors and some advisors that we had from the outside. And the intention there was to take a look at not only our internal business, but as importantly, the markets \u2013 the trends in the markets, the trends in segments of the markets that we are highly invested in healthcare, transportation, these areas, very contemplative, steeped in fact in data \u2013 facts and data and just a very good bottoms-up process. That process lasted until just recently ended actually. And we made the decision that in the middle of January to separate into two companies and to do a separation. So that was it. We had no external process pressure on that, which has been reported a lot in the news. Actually, it was not engaged at all in the decision making process and so I\u2019m pleased with that. We came up with this decision based on market trends, based on our strengths and weaknesses, based on the performance that we had in these two businesses, based on the current dynamics and thinking by shareholders, by our customers, etcetera. Shareholders meaning, how they value allocation methodologies. ", "As far as management goes, one of the things I will start with me as we have gotten this a lot, one of the things that was removed from the process early as we went into this and I did with the Board was to move me out of this discussion. The decision about whether or not we split into two companies or what process we take on a go forward basis can\u2019t be based on an individual or with any worry about an individual. So literally I said, let us go through this kind of agnostic of individual and let\u2019s manage it from a process standpoint. Good news is that we did that, I have a great relationship with the Board. My future will be contemplated. I will make some recommendations to the Board and my future will be contemplated as part of those recommendations. I am both confident and solid in that. ", "And in the next year by the way, we have to spend a lot of time doing three things. One is taking $600 million \u2013 $700 million annualized costs out of the business. We have to split the company into two and we have to deliver the 2016 plan. Not small activities. ", "As far as Services leadership, if there is one thing that we will change from a structural standpoint today, that we know today, even though it\u2019s not implemented today, is that the Services leadership will come from the outside. But I want to make sure that we are clear. We have \u2013 the BPO leadership will come from the outside. I have a President who runs the Services businesses today. He is a very valued member of our company. He does a good job. We expect \u2013 I hope that he continues to operate in the business on a go-forward basis, but the new CEO of the company will come from the outside. ", "CFO, we put the CFO on the backburner. We didn\u2019t totally stop it, but we put the search on the backburner as we went into the structural review. This is a place where we will have strong internal candidates as well as some external candidates. It\u2019s just a good process to go through that. And we will have one and then eventually two CFOs as we go forward. And I am pretty comfortable with that process as well.", "I think I got all of the questions answered, I hope.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Thanks, Brian. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Matt Cabral", "Yes, thank you. So, on the Document Technology business now that you have a more focused printing company as one of the two entities going forward, can you talk about your views on the opportunities for consolidation in the market and if Xerox would look to participate in any of that consolidation going forward?", "Ursula Burns", "Most of our focus in this area has been on distribution consolidation and we are still actively pursuing that type of activity. We found that our brand is strong and our offers are very strong and we just have to get more people carrying them to the market. So, that will be our primary focus from an acquisition standpoint. That was one part of the question. What was the second part, I am sorry?", "Leslie Varon", "I think that was it. I just highlight a couple of additional things, Matt. On the distribution side, as Ursula said, we have been adding to the portfolio of businesses in the Global Imaging suite inside of Xerox. And Global Imaging was an acquisition we did in 2007. You know it\u2019s been extraordinarily successful and had a very, very successful 2015. In addition to that, we continue to pursue opportunities to expand our offerings in Document Technology, which includes the acquisition we did of Impika, a few years ago in order to position us more strongly up in the high-end of inkjet. So, we see further opportunities in those kinds of areas.", "Matt Cabral", "Great. Very good, thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Hi, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. Ursula, we would just sort of just love to get what your initial view is \u2013 current view is on how you guys would view I guess sort of the value pitch like really what\u2019s the pitch to investors, what will it be for the Doc Tech company given the revenue growth profile, margins are really solid, cash flow was up obviously. But as investors begin to develop themselves a view of the Doc Tech company standalone as investable assets, how would you like for them to think about it given the constant currency revenue growth profile of the company? And then just sort of a sub-question to that, this will be it for me. Anything that you can talk about that could be additive over time to the revenue growth profile would be \u2013 at least philosophically useful as well? Thanks.", "Ursula Burns", "Right. So, I will start with the Services, with the BPO company and then get into the Doc Tech company. BPO company, think about nimble, expensive, so growing, really keen focus on operational expertise and flexibility and a capital structure and allocation policy that\u2019s aligned towards investing for growth. Our services business \u2013 our technology business is market leader, cash generative and having a capital allocation strategy that is focused on returning a high proportion of that capital to shareholders. It will likely \u2013 it will have to be investment grade. We are going to push hard for that to be the case and invest and then make sure that we setup the company that way, because it has a financing business that\u2019s captured as you know and will benefit from the investment grade rating. And not look at the top line in total you have to look at the top line in sub-pieces. We will be able to have a better explanation and more discussion about that as we separate the companies, meaning that we will start speaking more about the graphic communications business and what happens underneath there and how it is transforming and how we are leading that transformation, how our Document Outsourcing business is growing, focused and how we are leading the transformations there? So, little bit more focused on the dynamics underneath the business that will help to sell both of these companies \u2013 the differences around both of these companies.", "Leslie Varon", "If Ananda, I could just put a point on a couple of things that Ursula said specifically to Doc Tech, because I think the growth opportunities on the BPO side are clear. If you step back and look at the Doc Tech market, it\u2019s a $90 billion market. When we combine the Document Outsourcing growth with the Doc Tech segment what you will see is that our performance was essentially down 4% at constant currency in 2015. So, it is clearly under pressure. But certainly, the developing markets economies were under pressure big time in \u201815 as well. So, I would call it modest decline and as Ursula said, with important pockets of opportunity both in Document Outsourcing as well as, for example, in graphic communications. So this is an area where we believe that a more focused business will be able to make selective investments in attractive growth markets and improve the performance on the top line.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Keith Bachman of BMO Capital Markets. Your line is now open.", "Keith Bachman", "Thank you very much. I feel like I am always following Ananda\u2019s question. I wanted to ask you two questions. I agree with the characterization that the Services business or the BPO parts of the service business is probably not congruent or leveraging the core printer business. With that said, I am not sure anything has really changed. I am curious what you really learned? In other words, why would you buy it? And then secondarily, part of the strategy over the last couple of years within the broader context of Services has been M&A. And I think Xerox has been \u2013 has not been able to generate the growth through inorganic means within the M&A side of services. Is that a pricing issue or a structural issue? What\u2019s the process and as you are in \u2013 going through the separation this year, will you have the ability to go ahead to engage in M&A even as you are trying to go through the separation? Thank you.", "Ursula Burns", "Yes. So, let me take both of those and it will be a little bit of a conversational tone. Let\u2019s start with the M&A piece. We have acquired in the first couple of years of our M&A during the year about $350 million worth of assets for a couple of years in a row and the last 2 years have not been able to generate that same level of performance. We were always shooting for more. By the way, we have \u2013 it\u2019s not, not seeing opportunities. The good news is that we do see some. We also have \u2013 but we do have very specific requirements and high hurdles for accepting an M&A deal. I don\u2019t expect that those hurdles will go away at all. So, we are guiding down as you can see, $100 million to $400 million in M&A, because we do have \u2013 as I said, a high hurdle. I think we will be able to get somewhere in the middle of that range, maybe to the high end if we are a little bit lucky there. So, no strategic change in M&A, no strategic change in our desire to acquire, a little bit narrow and we talked about being a little bit less diversified in our offers, definitely focusing on commercial healthcare, definitely focusing on transportation and those assets. Focusing a little bit in those two areas and maybe others in going internationally, so \u2013 but I don\u2019t think that there is a big change. We are not having a big change in our strategy for M&A and we are going to keep trying. As I keep saying, I have money to spend. I am hoping that we can actually use it more frequently than we have in the past.", "As far as what has changed, 7 years ago, I said this a little bit earlier, 7 years in business is like 7 years in dog years. A lot has changed in 7 years. The healthcare market has changed, not only in how healthcare is provisioned and paid for, which has a big effect on us. But in the provider area, how much consolidation there has been, literally buying and selling of very large customers. So, companies saw our customer set has changed. International markets have slowed pretty significantly and the dollar has strengthened pretty significantly. There have been a lot of shifts in technology and etcetera. So a lot of things have changed in the markets around us. And all that have done, they haven\u2019t changed the fundamentals of the two businesses, but it has made it very, very clear that fitness and focus is at a premium right now. And that\u2019s where we have chosen to make our investments. Fitness and focus, I need to invest a little bit more in our Services business, particularly as the shifts are happening in there and as a service and cost of automation, etcetera. And we have to be very pointed in our focus in Document Technology and make sure that we continue to drive efficiencies through that value chain, etcetera. So we didn\u2019t look back. We didn\u2019t spend a lot of time in our analysis looking back to what we did 7 years ago. We spent all of our time looking forward and we are very confident in our decision on a go-forward basis.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks Keith. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Hey, great. Thanks for all this detail. Long-term and short-term question, I guess the short-term one, just the incremental savings from the restructuring that you are announcing. How much of that will we see as incremental in 2016, is that net of any cost synergies we might see from the separation. And then just the longer term question on the BPO front, when you are talking about 5% industry growth, do you think, when you did your long-term study on the strategic review for that asset, do you think that the current business mix can get to a 5% growth rate with better focus and whatnot or do you see there potentially a big shift in the business mix to get there? Thanks.", "Ursula Burns", "Let me start with the second question, do this first part of the \u2013 first question, then Leslie will take over. Second question, we haven\u2019t really looked at a specific growth rate and whether we can get the 5%. But I can tell you one thing and that\u2019s that we can grow higher \u2013 faster than we are growing today. There is no doubt about that. Particularly as we mix our portfolio, we are heavily mixed towards customer care. That business by the way, we can actually grow that business a little bit faster than we are growing it today, but that business doesn\u2019t have a margin profile that we actually want to expand too much further. So we are being very selective in how we go forward in customer care and picking our customer care accounts and engagements that actually are broader than what we would call bare customer care. And rest of the business lines, transportation for sure and commercial healthcare and even government healthcare, the core portion of it are growing at rates that can support a 5% rate. But we have to do some portfolio mixing to make sure that we can actually \u2013 mixing and timing to make sure that we can get there over time. And you will hear more about it as we do even deeper work in the separation process and looking at the BPO business.", "As far as \u2013 I just want to also transition to this $2.4 billion and make sure that we are clear about what we are doing here. Normally in Xerox and so every year in Xerox, we do a fair amount as you know of restructuring and remixing of how we spend the money. We get some productivity benefits from our vendors. And we get the rest of the productivity benefits from us. This $2.4 billion is foundational in three basic parts. One, we will get some part of it from our normal interactions with our suppliers to make sure they actually drive some of their productivity and give that to us. We can get to be about $1 billion over the 3 years plus or minus \u2013 give or take some. And we also get naturally, every year level of productivity from both our tech and services business foundational. And what we are explaining and what we are doing with this transformation was taking that first part and the second part and adding on top of it a $600 million additional savings program. And we are doing that by changing \u2013 focusing on changing how we work. This is not and it\u2019s a big \u2013 we are kind of readying ourselves for the markets in the future and the business in the future and trying to actually shift out \u2013 take out an additional $600 million as we go forward. And I will have Leslie go through some of the \u2013 a little bit more line item here.", "Leslie Varon", "Yes. So Tien-tsin just to come back and clarify a couple of things, when Ursula was talking about customer care, it is clearly our objective to expand the customer care margin. It is not our objective to increase the proportion of customer care business inside of our BPO business.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Perfect.", "Leslie Varon", "So we certainly want to grow customer care. We want to grow the other higher value offers more quickly so that we can drive the BPO margin up. With regard to cost transformation, we save about \u2013 we capture about $600 million a year, which is roughly 4% to 5% kind of annual productivity. In addition to that in 2016, we are expecting an annualized savings from the transformation program of about $100 million. And that will be captured from a variety of focus areas, things like the structure of the organization, so we can start the two separated companies lien, which will include both layers of management as well as support functions and infrastructure. It will include labor productivity and taking advantage of automation and changing how we deliver services to our customers. So our expectation is that we will invest about $200 million in restructuring this year, in 2016. And since we will be doing the transformation throughout the year, we are really just starting. We expect the savings that we generate in 2016 will be probably around $50 million from the strategic \u2013 from year one of that incremental program.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Tien-tsin. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question will come from Jim Suva from Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you and congratulations. It seems like you definitely have done a lot of work and a lot of work ahead. I have two questions, one fundamental operations, the other one on the separation. The first is on the fundamental operations, did I hear correctly the renewal rate was around 78% and I believe that seems a little bit normal, was there any cause behind that or something that we should be aware of. And then on the separation, the $2.4 billion, I believe that\u2019s all about the savings. The question I have is have you identified the amount of costs associated with the separation, like do you need an additional ERP system or human resource systems or are things actually already run right now on two different systems. I am just wondering if there is separation cost of the $2.4 billion in savings is net of those costs? Thank you and again congratulations on all the news.", "Leslie Varon", "So Jim, thanks so much for the questions. Let me start with renewal rate and then I will talk about synergy. So you are right that the renewal rate was light in quarter four and it was at 78%. Although for the year, the renewal rate was up 3 points to 84%. There was one large renewal in the quarter that would have been unattractive for us. And therefore, we walked away. With regard to dis-synergies, we haven\u2019t yet spoken about dis-synergies. But in some of the areas that you are poking about \u2013 poking at, there has not been a whole lot of integration, in for instance, IT between the ACS acquisition back then and the legacy Xerox. So we will talk more about dis-synergies as we go forward. But we certainly expect the benefits of the separation and inclusive of the strategic transformation to more than offset any of the dis-synergies.", "Ursula Burns", "So thank you for joining us and for your questions. I have a couple of things to close on. First, we are creating two strong market-leading companies, positioned to capture unique industry opportunities and maximize value. Each company will have resources that are appropriate and focus to capitalize on growth opportunities in their markets. We are going to leverage each company\u2019s distinct growth profile, operating model, cash flow characteristics, et cetera. And very importantly, during this year 2016, it\u2019s about delivering 2016, we are really focused on that. We closed 2015 well and I want to make sure that we carry that into 2016 and we will keep you up-to-date on how we are progressing as we speak to you throughout the year.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference.

(Broker)", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation First-Quarter 2016 Earnings Release Conference Call hosted by Ursula Burns, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer. She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investors. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox.

Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. At this time, I'd like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. I am pleased to report that at the end of the first quarter, we are on track to deliver on our three commitments for the year. Meeting our guidance, reaching the first year target for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation into two companies.", "I will begin with an update on our progress on the new path forward for Xerox. Before turning to first-quarter results.", "In January, we announced plans to separate into two independent publicly traded companies. One comprising our Document Technology and Document Outsourcing businesses and the other our Business Process Outsourcing business. Both will be Fortune 500 scale companies that are leaders in their respective industries.", "Further demonstrating our commitment to driving shareholder value, we concurrently announced a strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in cumulative savings over three years which includes both ongoing and incremental initiatives to enhance productivity and efficiency. We are looking at all aspects of our business to make them more agile and competitive and expect to achieve $700 million in annualized savings this year.", "Together, these actions will create two focused companies that have strategies, talent and the organizational and capital structures needed to compete in their markets. We are making progress on both of these initiatives and I am confident that we are making the right steps to best position each company for the future.", "We've had positive feedback on our plans. Over the last few months we've been talking to employees, clients and partners regularly about the benefits of the separation and what it means to them. Our clients see the benefits of increased focus and responsiveness to the market. In fact, I met with the executive teams of two major clients in the past couple of weeks, both in the top 75 of the Fortune 500 and both express their positive view.", "And our employees tell us they are excited to be part of the journey and to work for companies that are innovative and leading their industries. During the last three months, we have made substantial progress in building strong operational and financial foundations for both companies.", "We formed a program management office or PMO that is driving the separation and strategic transformation initiatives. Reporting to an Executive Steering Committee that I lead. The PMO working with the business teams is designing operating models and organizational structures, is also responsible for structuring the separation transaction and designing the optimal capital and legal structures.", "We are also taking a close look at the business strategies for both Document Technology and BPO to ensure they are fully optimized. We have identified a number of ways to sharpen each business strategy and improve execution. We are completing this analysis and will develop detailed action plans to capture the highest value opportunities. Some of that implementation will begin this year with more to come post separation.", "Many of you have asked about milestone decisions regarding leadership and financials. These are critical decisions that require a thoughtful process. While I can't answer all of your questions at this stage, I can share a few insights on where we stand.", "With regard to the leadership of the two companies, our searches are well underway and we have high quality candidates for each key executive role. While the timing for completing the hiring process for very senior roles is difficult to predict, we are targeting to fill the top roles by midyear. In addition to the management teams, we are reviewing candidates to fill the additional board seats created as a result of the separation.", "On financials, the big milestone is the filing of our initial Form 10 Registration Statement with the SEC. We are on track to do that in July in line with our goal of completing the separation by year end. We've decided that the optimal way to execute the separation is through a tax-free spinoff of our BPO business. The Form 10 will describe the transaction in detail and provide more information on the BPO company.", "We have also quantified the cost associated with the separation in the first year of the strategic transformation program. We expect to incur one time separation cost of $200 million to $250 million and restructuring costs of $300 million. Leslie will provide further details on this shortly.", "So all in all, very good progress on these initiatives. We are on track to launch two companies at year end that will have the right strategies, the right structures and the right leaders.", "With that said, I want to emphasize that we are managing these programs to ensure our executives team and employees remain focused on serving our clients with excellence and delivering our 2016 plans. So let's talk about how we are doing on that front.", "In the first quarter of 2016, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.22 within our guidance range. GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.03. Total revenue of $4.3 billion was down 4% or 3% in constant currency. Reflecting growth in our Document Outsourcing and BPO businesses, offset by continued revenue pressures in our Document Technology segment.", "Operating margin of 7.2% declined 130 basis points year-over-year. In Services revenue growth improved and margin increased modestly compared to last year. Document Technology revenue continues to be impacted by the weakness in developing markets. And currency negatively impacted Doc Tech margin. As a result of these factors, we have accelerated our cost reduction initiatives resulting in a sizable restructuring charge. We expect to realize the benefits of these actions beginning in the second quarter.", "During the quarter, we also continued to strengthen our portfolio with new products and offerings that showcase our innovation. Here are a few examples. In the healthcare market, we launched Xerox Health Outcome Solutions, a full lifecycle population health management solution designed to help providers adapt to value-based contracts.", "The centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have set a requirement that by 2018 50% of all payments must be value-based, meaning providers are compensated for healthy outcomes rather than each service provided.

Bottom line, we met our guidance and are confident that we're taking the right steps to achieve full-year objectives.", "Some of our underlying results were mixed and we are pulling all levers within our control to successfully navigate in a challenging market environment and best position our businesses for the future.", "I will turn it to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start by walking through the income statement and then discuss guidance, before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Before I get started, I'll remind you that the information I'm sharing reflects the reporting revisions we announced last quarter.", "Total revenue of $4.3 billion and adjusted earnings of $0.22 were within our expectations. Services delivered modest profit growth, while Document Technology declined due to revenue and transaction currency headwinds and cost reduction timing.", "Revenues in the quarter was down 4% in actual currency and 3% at constant currency, an improvement from the 5% constant currency decline in quarter four.", "Services top-line was up 2% at constant currency with growth in both Document Outsourcing and BPO. Document Technology declined 9% at constant currency and drove the overall revenue decline. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment.", "Gross margin of 30.3% was down 130 basis points year-over-year, driven by declines in Document Technology and a greater mix of Services, which structurally has a lower gross margin. RD&E was lower by $8 million year-over-year and SAG was down $35 million or 4%. Good expense reductions in absolute terms, but not sufficient to offset gross margin declines resulting in operating margin of 7.2%, down 130 basis points year-over-year and an 18% operating profit decline.", "Adjusted other net expense was higher by $8 million year-over-year, driven by higher litigation reserves, while equity income of $37 million in the quarter was up $3 million year-over-year.", "Our first quarter adjusted tax rate of 22.5% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by about a $0.01, and reflecting higher foreign tax credits, as well as the geographic mix of profits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.22 was within our guidance of $0.21 to $0.24 and was $0.02 lower, driven by Document Technology.", "Taking a closer look at Services, results in the quarter were largely in line with expectations. Good top-line growth continued in Document Outsourcing and BPO was up slightly. Margin improved modestly year-over-year. Together, those two drove 2% segment profit growth.", "Services revenue grew 1% or 2% at constant currency. BPO was up 1% at constant currency, as growth from acquisitions and new contract ramp, particularly in healthcare, more than offset headwinds in commercial from volume declines and lost business. Our decision and subsequent agreements with California and Montana not to complete the Health Enterprise Medicaid platform implementations was a revenue headwind but was partially offset by last year's first quarter California Health Enterprise adjustments.", "Good growth continues in Document Outsourcing, up 5% at constant currency, driven by strong Xerox partner print services growth as well as strong equipment revenue growth in large enterprise accounts following strong 2015 signings.", "Total signings in the quarter were down 11% year-over-year but up 9% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by fewer renewal opportunities this quarter. The total contract value of our new business signings was up 6% year-over-year driven by good growth in public sector. Our renewal rate in the quarter was quite strong at 89%, so at the high-end of our 85% to 90% range.", "Services segment margin was 7.7%, up 10 basis points year-over-year. Improvements in government healthcare, including the Health Enterprise decisions we made last year, were partially offset by margin declines driven in part by customer care where we have operational and efficiency opportunities. We've hired two well-respected leaders from the industry and they're beginning to implement changes to drive improved results", "Document Outsourcing margins while down modestly in the quarter remained strong and well above the overall Services margin. So good progress on growth and we're taking additional actions to drive further margin improvement.", "I'll now turn to Document Technology. This was a challenging quarter for the Document Technology business with economic, currency and product cycle headwinds. Revenue was down 9% at constant currency, in line with quarter four. Equipment revenue was down 14% year-over-year, including much higher declines in developing markets, especially the Middle East and Russia. Supplies revenue was down 7% year-over-year, much better than quarter four as channel inventory returned to more normalized levels.", "When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, the revenue declined continued at about 5%, which largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post separation.", "Turning to activity, within entry, A4 Color MFD growth was up 1% but overall results were pressured by developing markets. Midrange color MFDs also grew 1%, driven by growth in Document Outsourcing. We are expecting the new i-Series products, launched in March, to result in better midrange growth as we move through 2016. High end was the strongest performing product area with color installs up 56%, including strong growth in the entry production color products and iGen, and we are looking forward to the upcoming drupe printing trade show in early June where we will be highlighting a number of exciting new production printing products, especially in production inkjet.", "Document Technology margin of 10.2% was down 250 basis points year-over-year. As you know, quarter one is seasonally weak. Approximately 100 basis points of the year-over-year decline was driven by transaction currency. At March 31 rates, we expect very modest transaction currency impact in quarter two and for the balance of the year.", "Equipment price declines in the quarter remained within our historic range of 5% to 10%. The quarter one margin also reflects productivity, only partially offsetting the impact of revenue declines.", "Following lower restructuring in the second half of 2015, we significantly ramped up restructuring in quarter one and expect to capture incremental benefits from the strategic transformation program as we move through the year. Despite the first quarter challenges, we're confident the trend in both revenue and margin will improve, benefiting from recent product launches and cost actions.", "Moving to cash flow, operating cash flow was the use of $25 million in the quarter and in line with our expectations reflecting lower net income, the Health Enterprise settlement payment, and normal working capital seasonality following a strong close to 2015.", "Investing cash flows were a use of $125 million and included $72 million spent on CapEx, a $52 million payment to Atos for the final working capital adjustments from the 2015 ITO divestiture and $18 million invested for small technology acquisitions.", "Cash flow from financing was a $42 million use and includes $77 million for preferred and common stock dividends. In the quarter we retired a $700 million senior note and refinanced it with a senior unsecured bank loan.", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016.", "Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation, we ended quarter one with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7:1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of Q1 was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion.", "We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.", "Now to touch on capital allocation, we have a strong shareholder returns track record, having returned over 70% of free cash flow to our shareholders since 2011. Building on this, we announced last quarter an 11% increase to our common dividend, effective with the dividend payable on April 29 of this year. We did not repurchase any shares in the quarter.", "Turning to the next slide, I will share with you our second quarter earnings expectations and update our full year guidance to incorporate the separation related costs and higher restructuring, which Ursula discussed earlier.", "For the second quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.24 to $0.26 and GAAP earnings of $0.06 to $0.08. For the full year, we are reaffirming our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline and adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 per share. We are maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology.", "We're adjusting our full year GAAP guidance to incorporate the $200 million to $250 million of separation costs that Ursula previously discussed. Separation costs include professional fees, transaction costs and operational separation investments. We haven't yet included any tax charges to prepare for the separation. We plan to share additional separation details in July after we file the initial Form 10.", "As Ursula mentioned, we're accelerating our strategic transformation initiative and therefore expect to incur higher restructuring and related costs. We now expect to spend $300 million for the full year, $100 million more than we previously guided. And in quarter two, we expect to incur about $100 million in restructuring costs.", "Including the separation costs and the higher restructuring costs, we now expect full year GAAP EPS of $0.45 to $0.55 per share. We're adjusting our cash flow guidance to reflect both the cash separation costs and higher restructuring. We began this year with operating cash flow guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.5 billion. We indicated at the time that our guidance included $200 million of restructuring costs but did not yet contemplate separation costs.", "Factoring in cash separation costs of $200 million to $250 million, and the $100 million higher restructuring costs, we now expect operating cash flow of $950 million to $1.2 billion. We are also modestly increasing our CapEx guidance to $350 million to incorporate separation expenditures resulting in updated free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $850 million. This is an unusual year with separation related investments pressuring cash flow well below normal levels.", "We're revising our capital allocation expectations to reflect our updated free cash flow guidance. Dividends will be approximately $350 million for the year and reflect the 11% increase. We expect acquisition investments will approximate $100 million and we'll use the remainder of our free cash flow to reduce debt as we seek to optimize the capital structures of the two companies.", "Share repurchases have been a significant part of our capital deployment during the past few years including $1.3 billion last year as we returned to shareholders a large portion of our strong cash flow including the ITO divestiture proceeds. This year, given the separation, we don't plan to repurchase any shares.", "So in summary, a mixed quarter but we met our guidance and remain committed to delivering our full year objective with accelerated strategic transformation benefits to protect the bottom line.", "With that, I'll hand it back to Ursula to wrap up.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Leslie. To recap, at the end of the first quarter we are on track to deliver on our plan for the year. Our first quarter results were in line with expectations. We saw good performance on key measures in our Services business and continued pressure in our Document Technology business. We've taken decisive actions to address our challenges and improve margins including accelerating our cost optimization efforts in line with the strategic transformation program that we announced in January. Looking ahead, we're focused on our three commitments, meeting our guidance, reaching the targets for our strategic transformation program and completing our separation. We remain confident that we'll do so.", "With that, let me turn it to Jennifer.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ursula. Before we get to your questions for Ursula and Leslie, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow on and multipart question so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess on the \u2013 the first one just on the restructuring, I just wanted to clarify the higher restructuring cost. Is the incremental more on the Doc Tech side or the Services side? What is included there?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we expect the additional restructuring to span the business, both Doc Tech and the Services business, as well as our central corporate costs. So not focused on either side particularly, spanning both businesses.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got you. And I'm curious with the plans on the restructuring \u2013 I think we talked about this a little bit last quarter, just the impact on Services and signings and renewals. It sounds like nothing stood out this quarter, but how does it feel, Ursula, in terms of the conversation flow? I noted that the margins have been holding up even with some of the healthcare changes, so any additional color you can share there? Thank you.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think just focus a little bit on your question, yes, what we're seeing in the business and the actions that we're taking is to assure that when we separate these two businesses, and obviously in 2015 as well, that we get the cost structure and operating model right for these two businesses. When we look at restructuring and all of the strategic transformation programs, it's focused on leaning out the infrastructure of the business. So everything from spans and layers to how we approach the market from a selling perspective, how we approach the market from a supply chain perspective, et cetera. All in leaning out cost and efficient operations, not to impact our revenue flow or how we service our customers. And I think that what we've shown in the first quarter is the ability to actually do that, to drive restructuring and kind of fall in our expectation range and hold up our full-year commitments in both BPO and in Doc Tech and in the full company perspective.", "So, I think you're right; we're trying to balance all these things. There's a lot of stuff going on, but I think we're keeping our eye on the ball and delivering fairly well. In line with separation as well, by the way, we'll do that by the end of the year.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tien-tsin.", "Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks for the answer (29:38).", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah from Brean Capital.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. So I guess just quickly, a question clarification. You guys mentioned $700 million in annualized savings this year. I was just hoping to get some context around that. How much of that is to the bottom line versus invested? And I guess my quick calc is it's something like $0.60, which is big. So, if you could give us some sense of pass-through versus invested. And then as part B of that, is the tax-free spin, are those tax saves in there as well? Just context around that and how that would hit? Thanks.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "Hi, Ananda. It's Leslie. So first of all, with regard to the $700 million of annualized savings this year, it's consistent with what we had previously said and underscores our commitment to deliver adjusted earnings of $1.10 to $1.20 this year. We, as you noted, increased the restructuring, quite frankly we did that in order to underscore our ability to deliver the range even though Document Technology revenues have begun the year a bit softer than we would have liked. So this year we don't anticipate investing any of the $700 million. Any investments of restructuring savings are ahead of us, not in 2016.", "With regard to the tax-free spin, I think what we've said is it's tax-free from a Federal income tax perspective. Any tax dis-synergies associated with the spin or any one-time tax costs associated with the spin will be explicitly identified post the Form 10 filing, so as we get to quarter two earnings announcement at the end of July.", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "Awesome (31:50).", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, Ananda. Do you have another follow up?", "Ananda P. Baruah - Brean Capital LLC", "I was just going to ask quickly, now that you've identified sort of the amounts initially of the cost saves, like where should we think about in the context of Ursula's comments, they lying across both businesses? What are just the major buckets for the cost saves and the efficiencies as we move forward? That would be helpful, thanks.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So you should think about them benefiting both gross margin and SAG.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. In both businesses, by the way. In both the BPO and the Doc Tech business.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Piper Jaffray.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Thanks. Good morning. Ursula, can you discuss how you might frame up potential cost dis-synergies that will arise from the split, including how dis-synergies may compare with the cost synergies you originally achieved from the ACS acquisition?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "George, what we are going to do on dis-synergies is we're going to try to hold that conversation until the middle of the year when we can get a better grasp on what they are specifically and not kind of dribble it out. But some of the general dis-synergies are what you call independent company cost dis-synergies; setting up a board, those types of things are the general buckets. But we don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves and kind of piecemeal it out. We'll have some very specific clarity in the middle of the year when we file some of the Form 10 documents and start to communicate more. But think about setting up two independent companies and the structures that you need for that.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So, George, it's Leslie. If I could just add on to that a bit, we certainly expect that over time, the benefits from our strategic transformation will significantly outweigh any of the dis-synergies associated with running two companies. As you know, as Ursula just mentioned, there are certainly public company costs, but when you look at dis-synergies that typically impact other companies, there will be less that we face because we haven't done a tremendous amount of integration of BPO with what was the Doc Tech organization.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Very helpful. And, Ursula or Leslie, Services margins in the quarter came in below the full year guidance range, which means there will be a catch-up event that will have to happen later in the year. Can you discuss your expectations for the cadence of services margin improvement through the year and what those drivers are? Thanks.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Think about expansion throughout the year quarter-by-quarter, that's the expectation, the plan. Services margins came in about where we would've expected them to come in, we expected to be below the \u2013 at the lower end of our full year ranges in the first quarter; it's a seasonally lighter quarter for us in general, and second quarter will be better third or fourth, like that. We are fairly confident of coming in, and that's why we're reiterating the guidance on our Services margin for the full year and by the way for our EPS, adjusted EPS for the full year, our cash flow we've adjusted down, and in our Doc Tech we reiterated as well. So it's kind of come in where we expected.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "George, a couple of things. You know we took $126 million of restructuring charges in quarter one that should benefit both businesses as we move through the year. We've announced another $100 million of restructuring in quarter two, which should also benefit the margins of both businesses as we move through the year. We called out a specific weakness in quarter one in customer care, where we have new leadership that we've recently brought into the company and we do expect to be able to address some of those operational and efficiency challenges as we move through the year. So we're pretty optimistic about delivering the 8% to 9.5% Services segment margin for the year.", "George K. F. Tong - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, George. Operator, can we have the next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross from Cross Research.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much. I wanted to dig a bit into the Doc Tech margins and especially given that this is a drupa year and there may be some, I would assume, timing challenges with when the expenses for drupa versus, theoretically, the benefits coming through on the commercial print side. So when we think about the 12% to 14% operating margin target that I assume you guys are holding to here, and you were at 10% this quarter. I know there's a lot of restructuring going on, but can you maybe give us some idea of how we should balance the need to invest in drupa, which only happens once every four years versus sort of the timing of the cost cuts coming through since you did lay off a pretty significant amount of people in the first quarter?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so I'm going to start and then Leslie will chime in. And I just I want to start with a level of clarity about what we are reiterating. We are absolutely reiterating full year Doc Tech margins in the 12% to 14% range. That is, we are confident that we can deliver that. We are also reiterating Services margin in the 8% to 9.5% range. We are reiterating revenue \u2013 our revenue guidance and we are reiterating our adjusted EPS guidance. All three \u2013 all of those things, four or five I just mentioned are not changed at all. We did have lower delivery of margin in the first quarter for Doc Tech but we are very confident.", "drupa, other product launches, timing of our save (37:55), the flow of currency and how it impacts our margins, they will all come out in the next three quarters, delivering somewhere between the 12% and 14% margins that we spoke about. Leslie can speak more on this as well.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So, Shannon, just to reiterate, the transaction currency costs us about 100 basis points year-over-year in terms of the Doc Tech margin. So Doc Tech margin of 10.2%, down 250 basis points, 100 basis points of that was transaction currency. We believe that $19 million pressure in quarter one turns to essentially negligible in quarter two. And when you add on top of that, the restructuring benefits that we expect to capture, from the restructuring that we did in quarter one and that we're doing more of in quarter two, we're very, very confident of being able to get to the 12% to 14% range for the year. With regard to drupa, you're absolutely right. It is in the investment that we make once every four years but it is relatively modest compared to, for instance, the transaction currency headwind that we faced in quarter one.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you. That was helpful. And then, Ursula, can you talk a little bit about just philosophically if anything has changed on how you think about the capital structure of the two companies once they're split? How you think about what type of debt pay down might be required on the Doc Tech side given some of the pressures or just has there been any changes as you work through the last few months looking at the split?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So the answer to that in general is no. And I'll answer the question from the combined company perspective. That's the best way to address it and we'll talk about the split companies when we get further in the year. Our ability to generate cash and to have it available to operate the business in 2016 is identical, nearly identical, to our ability to generate cash and have it available in 2015. It's really important that we understand that, you understand that. About $1.6 billion operating cash flow in the year in 2016. We have to spend more on restructuring which we talked about. I think that's a good investment, a very solid investment in 2016 and will benefit us some in 2016 and will definitely benefit the two companies as we separate.", "We have separation costs which are unique in 2016. We'll have some in 2017 but a very small amount, a very, very small amount. We have normal CapEx of about $300 million. We have an additional $50 million of CapEx associated with separation that is also unique in 2016. That gives us a cash balance, a new free cash flow of somewhere between $600 million and $850 million, but most of that $850 million to $600 million, the reason why we're there is because of things that we don't expect to repeat in 2017. So as we flow into 2017 and leave 2016, we'll have a cash ability, generating ability of the two new companies that will be circa $1.6 billion just like it is this year without these one-time costs associated with the separation and with the bid restructuring that we're taking.", "So we don't say that \u2013 we don't view that a lot has changed over the last four months that we've talked to at all. We're getting more clear which we expect to do. We get more clear as we speak to you throughout the year, but it is important that you keep an eye on the fact that the fundamental cash flow and fundamental operations of the business haven't changed that much.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks Shannon.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Schneiderman with BMO Capital Markets.", "Steven Schneiderman - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Hi. Thank you very much for taking my call. I'm pinch hitting for Keith Bachman today. So my question is regarding capital allocation. We noticed that you reduced the M&A target towards the lower end of the previous range. What I want to ask is, is that more of a reflection of market conditions, a focus on separation or more of a reduced confidence to get the deals in the pipeline over the hump? And as a follow up to that regarding, excuse me, share repurchases can you talk a little bit more about the decision to waive the share repurchase for the rest of the year and focus more on the debt reduction, what some of the puts and takes were and why the focus in that regard?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I'll start with the share repurchase \u2013 with the M&A and I'll have Leslie take the share repurchase. Last quarter, we guided that we would be in the $100 million to $400 million but at the lower end of the range. What we're doing this quarter is we're narrowing it to the lower end of the range. We don't expect for us to be in the $400 million range, so we've actually take that off. Most of the change is driven by the fact that we're doing separation. It's not really a big indication of any significant change in the market. We are pushing hard for the $100 million, as I said, between both Doc Tech and Services, with a big focus on starting these two companies with the right financial position and capital structures and that's why share repurchase, M&A, debt reduction are all being played against each other to assure that we have good capital structures.", "For M&A, $100 million towards the lower end of the range was the ruling there. Share repurchase, Leslie will talk about it but we've moved share repurchase off the table. Did $1.3 billion last year, a very large amount of share repurchase last year and we don't think that we'll do any this year with the focus on debt reduction.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So I think Ursula has stolen most of my thunder. As she said, we did do $1.3 billion of share repurchase last year and we have also increased the dividend, which is the other way that we return capital to our shareholders. With modest M&A this year, we are going to prioritize the remaining cash toward debt reduction in order to optimize the capital structure of both companies. So we're pretty intent on ensuring that each of the two new companies starts competitive, start lean and start with an optimized capital structure, and that's where we're focusing our efforts.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Steve. Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman from Susquehanna.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to ask about this slide nine and the contract signings. I didn't hear you mention it in the call, but with regard to the 14% decline in contract signings, I was just wondering is any of that a function of your de-emphasis on government healthcare? Like is that really an apples-to-apples number or is there something else going on?", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So, it's actually lower renewal opportunities in the quarter.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So we're really pleased with the renewal rate that we delivered in the quarter of 89%, which is at the high end of our 85% to 90% target range. But there were less renewal opportunities. We're also really pleased that the new business signings in the quarter were up 6% year-over-year. So, strong new business, less renewal opportunities, but strong renewal rate.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We do expect the renewal opportunities for the full year to be essentially the same as it was in 2015, but as you probably know, if you don't know now that renewals come up in the year at various times. So we expect the full year bucket to be about what it was in 2015, maybe a little bit higher.", "James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP", "That was my follow up so that's helpful. Thanks for the clarification.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "Thank you.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jamie.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jamie. Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex from Morgan Stanley.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning and thank you for taking the question. I was wondering if I could touch a little bit on the BPO side of business, so up 1% constant currency. Given what you see in the pipeline, particularly with the signing of the toll road contract now and then New York MMIS coming, I guess how much visibility do you have into long-term growth? What might you anticipate that growth to be relative to, I think you stated last quarter, the BPO industry growing at 5% and what kind of levers should we look for as we go throughout the year to achieve those benchmarks?", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "Okay. So it's Leslie. I think over the longer term we are certainly focused on growing at the market. There are clear industries where we participate well, like healthcare, like transportation, like customer care, where over time we, for sure, should grow with the market rate.", "In the near term, we do have some puts and takes associated with some contracts that we have opted out of, or contracts that we've lost. So we're pleased with the BPO growth in quarter one and believe that for the year. It will enable us \u2013 BPO combined with Document Outsourcing, will enable us to deliver the Services revenue growth that we've committed, which is flat to up 3%. BPO will be a little lumpy in certain quarters depending upon the prior year compare.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Any color in terms of those contracts that you've either kind of skipped or opted out of and what the philosophy is around growing the business going forward? What were the dynamics of those contracts and were they issue riddled or pricing related or what might we be able to take away from those?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So outside of the government healthcare space where we've made and Health Enterprise in particular, where we've made a set of very conscious decisions to not complete the platforms. In general, if we move out of a contract it's because the contract profitability doesn't meet our thresholds; that's basically it. We don't have a lot of these, this is not a large bucket of business, but we are being very disciplined in ensuring that as we move forward with contracts that, particularly if they are not in the areas of focus for us, which are transportation and healthcare, if they're not in those areas, and they have very low profitability or marginal profitability, we will move out of those contracts, obviously working with the clients and not leaving them in the lurch.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "And as we think about the new business that we compete for, we're also being very measured in ensuring that the new business that we take on has the margin profile that we're seeking longer term for the Services business.", "Brian L. Essex - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Brian. Operator next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral from Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the impact of currency and specifically the yen on Doc Tech margins. If I look at current spot rates on the yen, it looks like it will be up about 9% year-over-year across the remaining three quarters relative to a 4% comparison in Q1. I guess, with that in mind, why wouldn't we expect the margin headwind to get a little worse throughout the balance of the year relative to the 100 basis point headwind that you saw in the first quarter?", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So, Matt, there's a few things that I think you should understand about the impact of the yen. First of all, we have a currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox, where they take half the good news or the bad news and we take the other half, that happens over time. Second of all, we do hedge and therefore the impacts of currency movements will be more muted and will flow in over time.", "The last point that I would make vis-\u00e0-vis the yen strengthening in particular is that it tends to lead to a less competitive or a more muted competitive pricing environment; a good thing, and we also have the benefit of translating our equity income from Fuji Xerox at a more attractive rate when the yen is strong.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. And then, Ursula, as a follow up, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you've identified some ways to sharpen the business strategy and improve execution post split, is there anything that, at this point, you can share in those opportunities? And related to that, how should we think about the go forward strategy for the two businesses heading into 2017 after this bid is finalized, relative to how these businesses have been over the last few years?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we've had a pretty intense engagement over the last, I think, let's say, six weeks or so, that has been refreshing; painful but refreshing in many ways, for both our Doc Tech business, Doc Tech with DO now, and our BPO business. We have found ways to improve three major areas. One is how we approach our customers, how we approach them organizationally and in what areas we dive deep with them and that should help us on the top-line, how do we organize that go-to-market in a little bit more efficient way.", "Second is how do we adjust our cost base inside, particularly we've talked about this a lot, spans and layers which \u2013 where we've done a lot of work, but with the help of some outside resources we've been able to look at to find ways to even be more sharp there. And then as we separate the two companies, we're taking this chance to look at just about every other piece of the business that moves and figuring out a way to lean that out those pieces of the business that move, lean them out and be significantly more efficient.", "The fundamental strategies though of the Doc Tech business and the BPO business, the fundamental strategies are the same. What we're doing here is we're rounding the edges a bit to make ourselves even more efficient. I was pleased with the work that we've done so far, but we still have some work to do.", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "Yeah, as Ursula said, I think there's two primary outcomes. One is sharpening the strategy for each of the two businesses and then the second is, for sure, improving our strategic execution. And part of the strategic execution is the transformation that we've been talking about.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Matt.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva from Citigroup.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you very much. Realizing that the separation has a lot of added costs and a lot of those costs are upfront breakup fees, can you help us understand \u2013 are 100% of them or the majority of them all going to hit this year? Or do separation costs continue beyond \u2013 so I'm talking separation, not to synergy which I believe that your synergy costs are permanent in nature?", "Leslie F. Varon - Interim Chief Financial Officer, Vice President, Investor Relations", "So the separation costs are dominated by both cost and outflows this year. There will be minimal costs that are incurred and cash outflows that are incurred in 2017.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you. And then \u2013 go ahead, Ursula.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I was just asking if you had more questions, so continue please.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Oh yeah, as a follow up, on the Document Technology, it's clear it started off a bit softer than expected in Q1, but you're kind of (54:44) your goals for Document Technology for 2016. Is it through additional restructuring that's going to come in and close that gap there? Or easier comps or some visibility, there's something that you can give us some confidence because it looks like the operating margins, and just the whole segment overall is starting off a little bit not quite where you'd like to, so how do you close that gap? Thank you.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jim. Full year, we were careful to be clear about the full year this year because we know that we have a lot of ups and downs in any given quarter. On a full year basis, Doc Tech margins, Doc Tech revenue we are reiterating our guidance and confident that we'll be able to get there. So no debate there. As far as the margins go and the revenue in the first quarter, they were a little bit lighter than we would have expected but not anything that would allow us that would cause us, as I said, to change our guidance.", "If you think about what we did in the second half of last year, and actually in the first quarter so far of this year, but in the second half of last year, we took no restructuring in the Doc Tech business. We did all of our restructuring in the Services segment, so we knew that we would have pressure in margins in the first quarter because we had literally no restructuring to offset the revenue declines. We've doubled up on restructuring in the first quarter. We have even more to do and we've announced an additional $100 million in the second quarter and we'll top the year at $300 million of restructuring which is why we are confident that we'll be able to actually hit the margin range for the full company that we talked about, the EPS that we talked about and the adjusted EPS we talked about. And the revenue shouldn't change that much.", "So it's the way that the business is flowing, no restructuring second half of the year, big restructuring this year help us to maintain and drive the margin range that we talked about in Doc Tech and in Services and no we're not moving away from focusing on the market and we'll be able to actually hit the revenue guidance that we've given as well.", "James Dickey Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thank you very much for the details from you and your team.", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "Great. Thanks, Jim.", "Jennifer Horsley - Director-Investor Relations", "That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything to wrap up?", "Ursula M. Burns - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "This is, as you can sense from listening to the call, this is a significant year for Xerox. We have three fundamental commitments that we have made to our shareholders. The first is to deliver our 2016 guidance. We are on track to do that. We are reiterating our full year guidance in EPS and in revenue; we're doing that for both BPO and for Doc Tech and for the full company.", "Second is to actually implement a strategic transformation that gives us two very strong companies, well-seated companies, on January 1, 2017. And we are well onboard, well on path to do that, and we are very confident in our ability to hit the second.", "The third is to hit the separation date, which is January 1, 2017. A lot of work on that, going very well. And we're very confident in our ability to do that.", "So these three things, we are focused on and we're pleased with the progress we are making and very confident in our ability to pull it off. So thank you for joining our call today and we'll see you next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today's conference.

She is joined by Leslie Varon, Vice President and Interim Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox.", "After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which by their nature address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Ms. Burns. Ms. Burns, you may begin.", "Ursula Burns", "Good morning. Welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. On our first quarter earnings call, I made our three priorities for the year; achieving our 2016 financial plans, implementing our strategic transformation and executing the separation of the company. I also committed to you that we were pulling all the available levers and taking decisive action to achieve these objectives. Today, I am pleased to report strong second quarter results and significant progress on all of our priorities.", "We delivered substantial EPS growth, adjusted EPS above our guidance and margin expansion in both our business segments, putting us on track to achieve our full-year guidance. We also reached major milestones in our separation process, and for our strategic transformation program and remain on track to meet our targets for both initiatives. I am more confident than ever in our ability to create two companies better positioned to compete in their respective markets and capture opportunities to enhance shareholder value.", "Today, I will begin the call with an update on our separation and strategic transformation before moving to the quarter's financial and operating performance. As you know, in January, we outlined a two-part plan to create shareholder value and best position our businesses for the future, which we call our new path forward. The plan includes separating into two Fortune 500 scale, independent publicly traded companies by year-end and implementing a three-year strategic transformation program to deliver $2.4 billion in total cost savings from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives across our businesses.", "During the second quarter, we took important steps toward both the separation and our strategic transformation program targets. As a recap, I\u2019m starting with the separation. We named the two companies that will be created through the separation. The Business Process Outsourcing Company will be named Conduent Incorporated and the Document Technology Company will retain the Xerox name. We also identified the CEOs that will lead the two new businesses after the separation.", "Ashok Vemuri who officially joined us at the beginning of this month will become the CEO of Conduent. Ashok comes with a successful background in the industry and experience in leading corporate transformations. Jeff Jacobson, whom most of you know from his invaluable work as the President of our Technology business will become the CEO of Xerox. Both are exceptional leaders with highly relevant expertise that will be critical to executing the go-forward strategy for each company. You will hear more from them as we approach the separation, and I look forward to working closely with both of them as we continue to build the foundations of the two companies and prepare them for standalone.", "With future leaders of the companies in place, we have intensified our CFO searches for each company and Ashok and Jeff are in the process of identifying the rest of their leadership teams. At the end of June, we filed our initial Form 10 registration statement for Conduent with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This is a major step in the transaction that will separate the companies. The filing kicked off a review process with the SEC and we expect to update the filing in the coming months with additional information.", "We have now scoped all costs associated with the separation and are providing additional detail. We are lowering our pre-tax onetime separation cost estimate to $175 million to $200 million. This is a credit to good cost management by the team, executing the separation process, and we have quantified one-time tax-related costs associated with the separation and expect them to be in the $40 million to $50 million range.", "Finally, we estimate dyssynergy costs to total $40 million to $50 million. We expect those costs to be more than offset by savings from our strategic transformation program, which I will discuss now. We remain on track to deliver $700 million in annualized savings in 2016 and $2.4 billion in total cost savings over three years from ongoing and incremental productivity and cost reduction initiatives across our businesses. We are already seeing benefits as some of the margin expansion we realized in the second quarter was a direct result of these activities.", "All in all, we made a great deal of progress on the company's new path forward during the quarter and I want to thank the strategic transformation and separation process leaders along with the Xerox management team for their efforts.", "Now, I'll provide a high-level overview of our second quarter results, before I pass it over to Leslie for additional details. In the second quarter, we delivered adjusted EPS of $0.30, representing a 30% year-over-year increase and coming in well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26. GAAP EPS from continuing operations were $0.15, up $0.06 compared to prior year quarter. Year-over-year EPS growth reflects fewer shares and lower tax rate and higher operating profits.", "Total revenue of 4.4 billion was down 4% with minimum currency impact, reflecting a modest revenue decline in Services and improvement in Technology business revenue trend. Operating margin expanded 80 basis points year-over-year to 9.3%, led by a 240 basis point improvement in our Services business. Margin gains reflect sequential cost and productivity improvements across our businesses, including benefits from our strategic transformation program. We generated cash flow from operation of 177 million during the second quarter and ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.2 billion.", "So during the quarter, we also had exciting wins in our businesses and bought several innovations to market. This was an important quarter for our Technology business with drupa, the biggest printing industry trade show, which occurs every four years taking place this June. We recorded strong sales in the Production Equipment showcased at the event. In addition, we shared details of our partnership with Koenig & Bauer Sheetfed Solutions Group, which we believe will be a game changer for digital carton printing, a growing area of the printing market.", "On the Document Outsourcing side, Xerox Managed Print Services business was named the Services Quality Supplier of the Year by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles U.S. based on the success of the global MPS program we implemented for the automaker over the past year. We also launched 15 new automated workflow solutions for the manufacturing retail and higher education industries.", "In our Services business, Everest Group ranked us as the Top Business Process Services Provider in its BPS Top 50 report just this week. The group also named our contact center outsourcing business an industry leader for the fourth year in a row. Analyst firm HFS Research also recognized Xerox, placing us in the high performance category for contact center operations and finance and accounting as a service and just this week, we were named to the HFS Winner Circle for human resource operations as a service.", "In transportation, our work for SEPTA, the Philadelphia area mass transit system went live last month. The program, which runs on a new platform developed by Xerox is a major undertaking, bringing transit riders a new modern payment system. The first phase offers 10,000 riders the opportunity to buy cards for weekly or monthly rides on the subway, trolley and buses.", "Our healthcare services business introduced a new offering, virtual health solutions, allowing providers to integrate a comprehensive telehealth strategy within their mainstream care delivery system. And Xerox Litigation Services introduced a new analytics as a service platform. The analytics hub provided corporate counsel and law firms real-time visibility into the big data that they manage every day. As you can tell, our industry experts are hard at work, building next generation solutions and capabilities and successfully implementing business that we have won.", "I will now turn it over to Leslie, who will provide more detail on our financial results and 2016 guidance.", "Leslie Varon", "Thanks, Ursula, and good morning, everyone. I'll start with the earnings slide and cover the rest of the financials as well as our guidance before handing it back to Ursula to wrap up. Overall, quarter two was strong. Operating profit and earnings both grew with EPS above our guidance range. DocTech trends improved and we're building momentum in our cost initiatives. We have more work to do to capture greater productivity and turn around the revenue trajectory as we prepare to separate our two businesses. But quarter two was a very positive proof point and keeps us on track for the year.", "Total revenue of $4.4 billion was down 4% at both actual and constant currency, benefiting from a market improvement in Document Technology revenue, which was down 6% in constant currency, while Services revenue declined 1%. I'll speak more about both segments in a moment. Adjusted gross margin of 31.4% was up 20 basis points year-over-year, driven by improvements in both segments, partially offset by a greater mix of services, which structurally has a lower gross margin.", "Adjusted RD&E was lower by $19 million year-over-year and adjusted SAG was down $53 million or 6%. These expense reductions, combined with the gross margin improvement, resulted in operating margin of 9.3%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and a 5% operating profit growth.", "Adjusted other net expense was better by $15 million year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense, while equity income of $22 million in the quarter was down $7 million year-over-year. Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.8% was below our guidance range of 26% to 28%, benefiting our earnings by $0.025 due to higher foreign tax credits and the successful resolution of several audits. Bottom line, adjusted earnings of $0.30 was well above our guidance range of $0.24 to $0.26 and was $0.07 higher year-over-year, driven by the lower tax rate, fewer shares and higher operating profit.", "Turning to Services, segment profit was up $55 million or 30% year-over-year, as significant margin improvement more than offset revenue pressure. Services revenue was down 2% at actual currency and 1% at constant currency. Document Outsourcing grew 2% year-over-year and reflects continued good growth in Xerox Partner Print Services. BPO declined 3%, driven by known headwinds, including the impact from last year's Health Enterprise strategy change as well as lower volumes and lost business as we continue to focus on turning around some underperforming areas. Our drive to improve profitability also factored into a lower than target renewal rate of 82%, reflecting our decision not to renew several underperforming contracts.", "Total findings in the quarter were down 7% year-over-year, but up 2% for the trailing 12 months. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower new business signings, which reflects a tough compare due to last year's New York MMIS signing. We've strengthened our signings criteria, setting the bar higher on price, margin and deal term, particularly in customer care.", "Margin and related improvement actions have been an area of intense focus and we were really pleased with the 9.6% segment margin. That's a considerable improvement, up 190 basis points sequentially and 240 basis points year-over-year. Benefits from restructuring and cost actions flowed through and we saw a good contribution to the margin increase across most business areas, including Document Outsourcing where margins are similar to Document Technology. These areas of improvement more than offset continued revenue and margin pressure from customer care where we are taking action to turn around these set of capabilities.", "So key takeaways on Services. Document Outsourcing performance continues to be solid on both the top and bottom line. The set of strategic decisions we made in BPO last year, combined with our strategic transformation initiatives, are beginning to be reflected in our results, yielding improved profitability. This has impacted revenue growth. We'll continue to focus on improving our operational foundation and cost structure and then begin to put in place growth initiatives for the BPO business.", "I'll now turn to Document Technology. Document Technology had a very strong quarter with both revenue trend and margin improvement. Revenue was down 7% at actual currency and 6% at constant currency, with equipment and annuity each down 6%. The equipment revenue trend improved, driven by mid-range, reflecting new product launches as well as better sales to small and medium sized businesses. Supplies revenue was down 6% year-over-year, slightly better than quarter one results. When we include Document Outsourcing with Document Technology, revenue declined 3%, a significant improvement from quarter one. This largely reflects the current revenue profile of the new Document Technology company post separation.", "Turning to activity, within entry, A4 color MFD installs were down 9%, driven by declines in developing markets. Mid-range color MFDs grew 6%, driven by the new I series products launched in March. High-end color was up 14%, driven by growth in entry production color products.", "Following a very successful showing at drupa, we expect a greater weighting toward higher end production presses in the second half. This doesn't necessarily translate to better install growth as it will drive fewer units, but at higher-value, which should result in good revenue and annuity growth over time.", "Document Technology margin of 12.6% was up 10 basis points year-over-year and 240 basis points sequentially. This is in line with our historical and full-year margin expectation. We knew that quarter one was an anomaly, resulting from the lack of restructuring in the second half of last year, exacerbated by transaction currency headwinds. Quarter two margin reflected the initial benefits of the restructuring actions we ramped over the last two quarters and more modest transaction currency impact as well as equipment price declines at the lower end of our historical 5% to 10% range.", "So, overall, a very good quarter for Document Technology. We're maintaining our strategic cost transformation focus and we expect continued good profitability in both Document Technology and in Services as we capture additional savings moving through the year.", "Moving next to cash flow. We generated $177 million of operating cash in the quarter, reflecting net income and the strong underlying cash generation profile of our business model. Year-over-year, cash flow was lower, driven by working capital usage due to a reduction in payables related to lower purchases and payment timing, a $62 million Health Enterprise settlement payment, resulting from last year's strategy change, initial separation related payments as well as higher restructuring payments and approximately $50 million due to last year's ITO divestiture.", "It's important to note that quarter two and first half cash generation are consistent with typical seasonality and position us to deliver our full year expectations. Investing cash flows were a use of $67 million and included $73 million spent on CapEx. Cash flow from financing was an $87 million use and includes $84 million for preferred and common stock dividends. Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $1.2 billion and continues to provide us flexibility as we move through 2016.", "Turning to our capital structure and capital allocation. We ended quarter two with $7.4 billion of debt, roughly in line with our year-end debt level. Applying 7 to 1 leverage to our customer financing assets, our allocated financing debt at the end of quarter two was $3.9 billion, leaving core debt of $3.5 billion. We continue to manage our capital structure to maintain credit metrics consistent with our investment-grade credit rating.", "While it's premature to discuss the capital structure of the two future companies, all the financing assets and financing debt will go to the new Xerox Company, while the core debt will be split with Conduent. We'll share with you more about the capital structure and capital allocation strategies of Conduent and the new Xerox as we approach the separation. You should expect a continued focus on driving long-term shareholder returns with a strong alignment to each company\u2019s financial profile and market opportunities.", "And to touch on capital allocation, we have a strong shareholder returns track record. And in April, we increased our common dividend by 11%. As we prepare for our separation later this year and as we've said previously, we're not planning to repurchase shares as we focus on launching the two companies with the most optimal capital structures.", "Before I move to guidance on the next slide, I want to mention that while we're not planning to preview the Q2 Conduent results today, we will be filing them in a few weeks as part of the Form 10 amendment. I'd note that Conduent carveout financials will also reflect margin improvement, although not to the same degree as the Services segment. Conduent results include the student loan business, which resides in our Other segment. That business is in run-off and declined profit year-over-year as anticipated.", "I'll now share with you our quarter three and our full year expectations. For the third quarter, we expect adjusted earnings in the range of $0.26 to $0.28 and GAAP earnings of $0.14 to $0.16. We're reaffirming our full year adjusted earnings guidance of $1.10 to $1.20 and our revenue guidance of a 2% to 4% constant currency decline. We're maintaining our segment revenue growth and margin guidance ranges for both Services and Document Technology, and anticipate for Services that we'll be at the high-end of the segment margin range and at the low end of the revenue range.", "For the full year, we continue to expect GAAP earnings of $0.45 to $0.55. We continue to anticipate full-year restructuring of $300 million, including approximately $40 million in quarter three. Last quarter, we told you that we expected pre-tax separation costs would be in the range of $200 million to $250 million. We're deploying the same cost discipline in this area as we do across of rest of the business and have therefore, refined our range down by $25 million to $50 million. We now expect to spend $175 million to $200 million in pre-tax separation costs.", "We've also now scoped the tax related friction costs associated with reorganizing our domestic and international legal entities to affect the separation and estimate them to be between $40 million and $50 million.", "Turning to cash flow, we're maintaining our full year expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion for operating cash flow and $600 million to $850 million for free cash flow. This anticipates both our second half net income acceleration and the strong quarter four working capital performance we've historically delivered. And finally, our capital allocation expectations remain the same.", "So in summary, quarter two solidly puts us on track to deliver our full year guidance and we're confident on our trajectory entering the second half.", "Ursula Burns", "Thank you, Leslie. In summary, we're very pleased with our second quarter performance, which demonstrates our focus on execution and provides good momentum as we enter the second half. We exceeded our adjusted EPS guidance, made progress on margins and reaffirmed our full-year targets, all while executing at our separation and strategic transformation which will together, strengthen Xerox and the post-separation companies.", "Moving to the second half of the year, our priorities remain unchanged. We will deliver our 2016 guidance, successfully complete our separation by year-end and meet our cost savings target for 2016 for our strategic transformation program. You will be hearing more from us over the balance of the year as we continue to hit critical milestones.", "We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Ursula. Joining Ursula and Leslie today, is Jeff Jacobson, Head of our Document Technology business and Bob Zapfel, President, Xerox Business services. Before we get to your questions, let me point out that we have several supplemental slides at the end of our deck, which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit, follow-on and multi-part questions so that we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Ursula for closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Matt Cabral", "Thank you. Ursula, can you give us an update on your thoughts around M&A heading into the split, both in terms of your desire to do acquisition as well as if anything has changed around the view that you had previously that both businesses are not up for sale posts split, and that both make the most sense as independent public companies going forward.", "Ursula Burns", "Let me start with the middle question, which is the potential for sale of the businesses post-split. I think that we should probably wait till split to talk to the new leadership of those two companies to figure out what their plans are as we - as they proceed forward.", "As far as our plans for M&A, we have still $100 million in our plan for M&A, fairly modest plans for 2016. We've acquired $18 million so far this year and we're still in the market and still have plans to try to spend the $100 million both in DocTech distribution primarily and in Services, small tuck-in acquisitions if we can find them in the areas that are important for us. I think I answered all of your questions.", "Leslie Varon", "Yes, Matt. It's Leslie. I'll just add a couple of things. Obviously, with the focus on separation, you can appreciate we are focusing less on acquisitions in the near term. But for sure, it is important longer-term for each of the businesses. So Ursula said that we've been light in the first half, having spent $18 million. We do have our sights set on some opportunities in the second half.", "Matt Cabral", "Thank you. That's very helpful. And then on the third quarter guidance in particular, can you just drill down a little bit more and help us understand the puts and takes around both revenue and the margin profile for both segments in the September quarter, particularly following the strong performance that you saw in Q2?", "Leslie Varon", "Yes. So Matt, you know we have stopped giving quarterly revenue and margin guidance. We stick to full year guidance at the segment level, although we do continue to provide earnings guidance on the quarter. I think what you saw in quarter two and I'll start with DocTech, is an important improvement and moderation in the rate of revenue decline, both for the Technology segment, down 6% versus down 9% in the last - in the earlier two quarters. And importantly as well, down 3%, including Document Outsourcing, which is an indication of what the new Xerox will look like going forward. We continue to expect that revenue trends for the second half of the year will enable us to be in line with the full year expectation for the Tech segment of down 5 to 7.", "On the margin front, you saw important improvement in the margin in quarter two when you saw margin that's in line with our full year expectation of 12% to 14%. And that's what has underscored our confidence in reiterating the full-year margin.", "On the Services side, we've said that we expect margin will be toward the high-end of the 8% to 9.5% range. But revenue will be somewhat more muted. In the first half, revenues were flat at constant currency. Our full year range for the Services segment is flat to up modestly. And we\u2019ve said we'd be at the low end of the range. So we believe that quarter two was an important proof point and you will see continued progress in quarter three and for sure in quarter four, which is typically our seasonally strongest quarter.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research Group. Your line is now open.", "Shannon Cross", "Thank you very much. I wanted to talk about currency and more from a DocTech perspective, in terms of both what you're seeing from a pricing perspective, because given where the yen has gone, one would assume that may be pricing will be a little bit better this year, since the Japanese competitors won't be able to be quite as aggressive.", "And then also from a Fuji Xerox perspective, clearly you had hit below the line. But just what - how we should sort of think about COGS movement and I know there's a lot of restructuring that can offset it. But I'm just trying to sort of gauge it as we go through the year.", "Leslie Varon", "Yes. Hi, Shannon. So a few things on currency. What we said about quarter two was we did see equipment price pressures at the low end of our historic 5% to 10% range. So we saw that as a positive signal. Obviously, the strength of the yen helps us in the competitive arena in the marketplace. Importantly on transaction currency, what we saw in quarter one was, it was a significant pressure on DocTech segment margin and in fact, pressured margin by about 100 basis points.", "That margin pressure in quarter two was much, much more modest. It was about 20 basis points. And I think you recognize that in terms of the yen, we have both the currency risk sharing arrangement with Fuji Xerox. So it means that we see more modest impacts as we go through the year, both when the yen strengthens as well as when it weakens. And we have hedging in place, which also mitigate some of the impact. So we're pretty pleased with how we're positioned as it relates to the yen vis-\u00e0-vis our Japanese-based competitors.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay. And so if it stays like 103, do you feel very good about sort of everything that's in place because it\u2019s obviously moved a lot in the last few weeks?", "Leslie Varon", "It for sure has. And so once again, we have hedges in place. They obviously run out over time and so we'll mitigate the impacts and a currency risk sharing agreement with Fuji Xerox. And as you pointed out to the extent that the yen is stronger, it actually benefits our translation of Fuji Xerox equity income.", "Shannon Cross", "Right. Okay. Great. And then, maybe one for Ursula. Just as you think about and not specific cash flow generation numbers obviously. But the cash flow generation characteristics of the two businesses and as you start to sort of pull the companies apart, has anything sort of changed in the way how you're thinking about it or how we should think about it, as I guess, all the restructuring comes through. I guess I'm just kind of struggling to trying to figure out, what the right split is between the two businesses both sort of now and then when we get through or you guys get through this significant restructuring you're doing.", "Ursula Burns", "I think that you can think about these two businesses in the following way. The Technology business is a strong cash-generating business. It's in a very strong annuity based model. While we will be investing more actively in the Document Technology business, it will not substantially or significantly change the ability for us to generate cash in the DocTech business.", "In the BPO business, its cash generation ability is a little bit weaker than the Tech business. We'll be investing more actively in that business as we separate and they go into Conduent. So nothing has changed from - our perspective hasn't changed on those two businesses on how we view the cash movements there.", "Leslie Varon", "So Shannon, the other thing I would mention is that 2016 is not a normal year for operating cash flow generation at Xerox. Our cash expectations of $950 million to $1.2 billion are muted by three things. Number one is the impact of the separation cost, which is a couple of $100 million. Number two is the impact of higher than normal restructuring, which is probably worth another couple of $100 million. And number three are the Health Enterprise settlement payment, which should pressure cash flow this year by about $100 million.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Tong of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "George Tong", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Ursula and Leslie, you've reiterated guidance for Services revenue growth of 0% to 3% constant currency. Given the deceleration in constant currency services revenue growth you saw in the quarter, what factors in the back half of the year will help you land within your range?", "Bob Zapfel", "George, it's Bob. So I would say we had a couple of pressure points in the second quarter that will moderate as we go forward. And we were at minus 1 as you know, in constant currency for the second quarter. To be at the low end of the range, we need to be above 0 as we close out the third and the fourth. The pressure points in the second were really around - we had a very tough compare in public sector, the health in terms of some equipment sales that we had, had in prior year. We have the Health Enterprise, Montana, California, things have changed. That will dissipate as we go through the back half of the year.", "And then we also got out of some kind of revenue flow that was not profit producing that won't really moderate, but will basically - we'll basically be able to cover for with our signings. So we do expect that we can meet the range that we had established. And as you know, we've really been able to translate some of that revenue thoughtfulness in terms of what we want and what we don't want to pretty solid margin improvement and the 240 basis points that we delivered year-to-year in the second quarter, we see the ability to continue to drive at the top end of the margin range.", "George Tong", "Got it. That's helpful. And then as a follow-up, can you describe how your pipeline in BPO is performing? And whether you see any large deals or initiatives that can service a near or intermediate term catalyst for bookings and revenues?", "Bob Zapfel", "I would say our BPO pipeline has improved sequentially during the year. So the good news is that we do see sequential pipeline improvement, both in Document Outsourcing and in BPO. In all honesty, a little bit more aggressive on the Document Outsourcing side. But from a signing standpoint, we expect to drive new business growth in the third quarter. From a signings standpoint, we have seen a little bit of headwinds in terms of with the separation, decisional delays. And we're just working through that. So we expect to deliver better results in the third quarter year-to-year. But I wouldn't say that there's now some next New York MMIS that is so large that it would dramatically change the signings trajectory.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Thanks, George. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Hey, thanks. Good morning. Good to talk to you guys. Just on the Services margins, they're obviously good. It seems like there's a prioritization of margins over revenue growth. I'm curious if there's a lot more that can be done here in terms of moving away from some of the lower margin business, if things are coming up for renewal or what have you. Is there more? Or is this - was there anything unusual that we saw this quarter?", "Bob Zapfel", "No, I think. I'm sorry, it's Bob again. I think there wasn't anything particularly unusual. We are being more stringent as we look at new opportunities or renewals, if we're not able to make reasonable margin, it's time for renewal. We've got to convince the client that the service is worth more and they should pay more. And if we're unsuccessful with that, then we would rather move in different directions.", "So I do think that we'll see that. We'd still like to drive more new business growth though. This is not a one-dimensional play. We're trying to not grow and improve margins. We are trying to and expect to see some improvement in the second half of the year in terms of our constant currency revenue growth dynamics.", "Ursula Burns", "And the margin improvement is not solely from the fact that we've made decisions on new business or re-signing of contracts. It's also pure operational management, literally looking at the cost base and managing the cost base downward, independent of signing or not signing new business.", "Tien-tsin Huang", "Understood. That's good. Just really quickly the sales cycle, just to be clear, just on the BPO front, any big changes in the sales cycle from the past quarter?", "Bob Zapfel", "I would say we did see some extension, especially in June where not only separation, but where some of the clients, where the Form 10 didn't come out until June 30, wanted to, Ashok is now so that's very helpful in terms of clarity on the new CEO. But we did have a little bit of a push out in June. But as you saw, our overall results were still reasonably okay on a trailing 12-month year-to-year basis. But I would say we did see a little bit of extension in June on some of our pursuits.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Tien-tsin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi.", "Jim Suva", "Thank you and congratulations to you and your team at Xerox. A lot of work I'm sure. I have to questions, and they are kind of related. I'll ask them at the same time. First, on the lower renewal rate, it sounds like, from your prepared comments, that it was a decision not to go after lower profitability of work. Should we expect that to continue, and is that kind of one of the main reasons why the service profitability is underperforming so much, it's just a legacy of bidding too low or going after too low products or contracts? Or is it more that your costs are misaligned or things like that? Then the second question is you just mentioned an extension of some deals did not close in the June quarter. Did they close in early July? It kind of seems hard to believe that someone would wait to close it based upon the new name of the Xerox or who the new CEO is. And if that's the case, it seems like there's a risk that they maybe actually went away to a competitor. So did they close or did they go away? Thank you.", "Bob Zapfel", "We had a good start in July in terms of conversion of opportunities that we had initially been targeting in June. In fact, very large contract signing just yesterday. So I would say that, that piece and on the renewal rate, I mean, we're 85% year-to-date. We were a little bit lower in the second quarter and I think that we still see the ability to run in the 85% to 90% range. And if you get the right ones. So I would rather be 85% with the right mix that we re-won than be 90% with the wrong mix. And so I think we'll be able to deliver in the range as we look forward in the third and fourth quarters.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Jim. Operator next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Brean Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda Baruah", "Thanks guys for taking the question. Two if I could. The first is can DocTech actually get close to flat revenue in the second half of the year? The reason I ask is because you are talking about seeing pretty solid momentum through the June Q, and you just put up - you have new products that are going to ramp I presume through the second half of the year coming out of drupa. And you just put up a 3% decline up from 3% comp, and the comps get pretty easy in the second half of the year. You have 4% to 5% decline constant in the second half of the year. So I'd love to hear your thoughts there. And then if it can't get back to down close to flat, maybe it's down 1% or something like that, not totally flat. I'd love to hear why that can't happen. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes, this is Jeff. Good to hear from you. I think we have to remember, so first from the text segment standpoint, we reported guidance of 5 to 7 at constant currency, we're staying with that, I think you\u2019re talking more about that we put Document Technology and DO together, where we did improve from a negative 5 sequentially to negative 3. I think you have to remember is annuity is over 70% of our business, okay? So to turn that ship take some time, so you certainly, we won't be seeing that in the quarter or even next year. I mean, it's going to take a big part of the ESR turning. We do have plans in place for when we come out as Xerox, the new company for things we\u2019ll do will certainly be a little more aggressive in M&A appropriate so, but it will take some time to turn the 70% annuity to where we need it to be to get where you're pointing.", "Ananda Baruah", "Okay, got it. And you're right. I did read that wrong. So I have a follow-up on that, I'm going to hold that follow-up though because I want to ask this next one. So, a clarification on my math here. If you do the midpoint of the September you guide, the low end of your '16 guide, I think by my calculation you need to be $0.30 QoverQ in December Q, which if I recall correctly, is kind of the highest end of what you guys have done historically. So the question is, number one, given the strength of the June Q, is there some conservatism in any context taken into the September Q. And number 2 if there's not, then how do you actually just walk us through the mechanics of how you do the $0.30 to get to low end of the guidance range for the December Q.", "Leslie Varon", "So Ananda, its Leslie. First of all, it's been really hard to hear all of the elements of your question. But I think that jest goes like this. To get to the low end of our guidance using the midpoint of our quarter 3 guidance looks like our typical quarter 4 seasonality. And you would say agree. So the way we're thinking about this is that we will have the normal second half over first half uptick in profitability. And that will enable us to get at a minimum to the low end of the guidance.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Ananda.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Essex of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Brian Essex", "Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. I have a question for Bob, maybe if I could follow on to the question that Tien-Tsin asked, and maybe dig in a little bit more into the margins side of the Services business. And I think we are relatively comfortable with some of the services. One of the double-edged sword in the Form 10 is you saw how well some businesses were performing but certainly the commercial business stuck out kind of like a sore thumb. So, with regard to improving the performance of that business, I think you focused on a little bit signing better and more profitable contracts, but how much can be done on the cost side and what might be the trajectory of the margin improvement as you kind of work to improve that business? And then I have a follow-up.", "Bob Zapfel", "Yes, Brian. I'm sorry. So it's Bob. On commercial, as you know, the kind of the largest component from an offering standpoint of our commercial business is customer care. The other components, HR, outsourcing, learning, litigation, F&A are largely making good progress and are reasonable from a margin standpoint. So a big piece of our margin turnaround for the commercial customer set because it really is a customer set that buys a portfolio of offerings is really around the recovery plan that we\u2019re driving in customer care we bought in from the outside a couple of exceptional leaders. We\u2019ve got a big team over this. And we think it's not going to be an immediate that next month, we go from 0% to 10% margins. But we think we got a set of actions in place that we will really lift the margin profile of that component of commercial. We are honestly kind of blessed here. We got a great client set. We are ranked in the top quartile. So our problem is more our internal. So if we got the cost management crisp enough, but it's a business that we're able to win in and we've got the set of actions. And I do believe that we can then elevate back to reasonable margins in the commercial component of our BPO. Not as high as we get in public or healthcare where we got a lot of separate industry based IP and solutions. But reasonable within the portfolio of BPO, co-work, Conduent going forward.", "Brian Essex", "Got it. Maybe as a follow-up - I appreciate the color. As a follow-up, the stuff that's bucketed into other, some of the legacy run-off like student loans and other that are in that \"other category\", how much of a drag on consolidated corporate margins can we expect from those business? When might that stuff go away and at what rate might we see that decline?", "Leslie Varon", "So it will be a significant drag on Conduent quarter 2 financials. So when you see the Form 10 student loan as anticipated is in runoff and declining significantly year-over-year. And we expect that will continue throughout the rest of this year. But by 2017 should no longer be an issue.", "Brian Essex", "How much is student loan? What else is in there?", "Ursula Burns", "Any Other.", "Leslie Varon", "As it relates to Conduent, student loans.", "Brian Essex", "Perfect thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Brian. Operator next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Bachman of BMO. Your line is now open.", "Keith Bachman", "I wanted to ask about the BPO question. If I look really in two vectors, if I look longer-term post-separation, Bob, if you just think about the pipeline now, is there enough to generate year-over-year growth in that business on an organic basis? And related, if the cash flow - all BPO businesses have a lower cash flow, and M&A is clearly a big part of the industry right now and has been for some time. What is going to be the ability of the Services business to leverage M&A to try to not only increase your growth rate but, more importantly, to increase the capabilities and skill sets and reach and all that goes with it?", "Bob Zapfel", "So let me start with the pipeline and the organic growth component. I would say that the pipeline is sufficient to get to modest organic growth and we would need to build the pipeline to elevate that growth rate to what would be our more likely long-term targets. I think on the M&A component, it's a little bit too early. We're going to be in the cycle as we get ready for Investor Day to talk more about the capital structure, debt, everything else. So I wouldn't want to comment at this point, relative to what the M&A prospects would be for Conduent.", "Ursula Burns", "Let me make something very clear. The strategy for this business, BPO before we decided to separate and post-separation, one plank of the strategy is going to be acquisitions. It is a business that had to acquire to fill out capabilities and to grow revenue and that will continue to be the case as we move into the Conduent business.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. And Ursula, my question was more philosophical, is there going to be enough free cash flow to support that strategy post separation was really the nature of the question.", "Ursula Burns", "Keith, that's the question. I mean, that's the strategy. That's the plan. That's how we're going to structure these businesses. That's how we are trying to lay the foundation in '16 and our capital structure that allows us to operate Conduent strategically to win. And one of those elements is clearly to acquire is to have an active M&A business.", "Keith Bachman", "Okay. Great. And just one clarification, I wanted to follow-up with. Could you remind us what the limitations, one of the questions was will they remain independent entities post-separation, but what are the limitations from a tax basis on the ability to complete a transaction post-separation, the tax-free nature of the spin?", "Ursula Burns", "Well, I think that's something that you should probably call us and talk to Jennifer about later. We have it all comprehended, and Jennifer can bring it you in details. I think it would be a little bit complicated to get through right now.", "Keith Bachman", "Fair enough. I'll cede the floor.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Keith. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is now open.", "James Friedman", "Good quarter here. Congratulations on the improvement in the margins. I just wanted to kind of dimensionalize what the possibilities are for the services margin in particular. Bob, I was wondering if you might have any metrics you could share about utilization. You don't disclose that in the Form 10, or at least in the preliminary Form 10. How should we think about that going forward? Your headcount is down a lot. I would think the utilization would be up. Anything you want to quantify if you could qualify it. I'll just do my follow up now. Could you share what percentage of your contracts were - as either a percentage of contracts or percentage of your Services revenue are losing money? Some of your competitors disclose that. It is just very hard to model the services going forward. Clearly great progress but without those two elements. Thank you", "Bob Zapfel", "Okay. So first on the utilization question. Your right to notice that our headcount dynamics have turned favorable. That is related not only to utilization. Honestly, we probably got more of the headcount reduction out of non-production workers more in the way of middle management, if you will, then just purely on the production worker component. We don't disclose utilization mostly because it's different in every business. The targets between customer care and transaction processing and HR outsourcing. But a big component of our strategic costs transformation play is around robotic process automation and trying to leverage technology to then increase that utilization rate. So we're managing - we're really, really trying to be very, very disciplined on headcount management. And that will clearly be a component of the ongoing margin lift that we need to drive both in Xerox Services and then downstream in Conduent. Relative to what proportion of the contracts are below water. We've really gotten a lot more sophisticated in looking at fully allocated P&Ls, which has helped us in kind of identifying something that may be didn\u2019t look so bad from a contribution margin standpoint we really need to do even better on. I wouldn't want to give you a hard figure, but it's not a high proportion of the contract. It's not as though out of our, you know, out all of our contracts that there is a big number of them that are below water and the ones that are were on kind of very aggressive active recovery plans.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Jamie. That's all the time that we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Ursula, anything more to wrap up?", "Ursula Burns", "Yes. So as Jen said, thank you for your questions. This was a strong quarter for Xerox with margin improvements across our businesses and encouraging signs of improvement in the technology revenue trend. Going into the second half of the year, we are highly confident in our ability to deliver our three priorities, which are meeting our financial guidance, creating two strong companies - two strong independent companies; and driving our strategic transformation. We look forward to providing you with updates on our progress and more detailed looks at the post-separation company financials and business strategies in the coming months. Thank you, everyone for joining our call.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Ursula. That concludes our call today. If you have further questions, please contact me or any member of our Investor Relations team.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today's conference.

He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on the quarter as well as our expectations for full-year 2017. In the second quarter, we delivered earnings, operating margin and cash flow that were all in line with our expectations. Additionally, with the progress we are making on the roll out of our ConnectKey products, we are better positioned to capitalize on the strategic growth areas in the market. With two quarters behind us, we continue to be on track to deliver on our full-year commitments.", "Let me walk you through an overview of our second quarter financial results. Second quarter GAAP EPS was $0.63 and adjusted EPS was $0.87, which reflects our one-for-four reverse stock split effective June 14, 2017. Revenue of $2.57 billion was down 8.1% year-over-year or 6.4% on a constant-currency basis, driven by equipment revenue. We had anticipated lighter second quarter equipment revenue given the timing of the new product launch, but it was softer-than-expected as we saw some delays transitioning to the new products.", "This also affected our Managed Document Services business, where sales cycles are longer and all the Q2 declines were driven by the equipment shortfall. The transition to the new products impacted our overall revenue by about 1 point. We expect to see new equipment flowing through as we move through quarter three and building more strongly in the fourth quarter and into 2018.", "Post sale revenue was 79% of total revenue and declined 5.7% with 3.9% at constant currency, consistent with the first quarter and in line with our expectations. We expect continued stable post sale revenue with improvements coming over time as equipment revenue improves and placements grow. Adjusted operating margin was 13.3%, an improvement of 40 basis points year-over-year. We continue to realize productivity benefits from our strategic transformation initiatives, which are helping maintain our strong margins, while offsetting 100 basis points of currency as well as our revenue decline.", "Operating cash flow remained strong and was a solid $343 million in the quarter, driven by working capital initiatives as well as the fact that pension contributions are expected to be heaviest in the latter half of the year. We ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.25 billion. The second quarter was highlighted by the introduction of our new ConnectKey enabled portfolio, 29 AltaLink and VersaLink printers and multifunction devices. The launch of the new products has been a huge effort that has spanned the entire Xerox team, and I am extremely proud of what has been accomplished and what is yet to come. Most of these products are available now and the balance will be available in the third quarter.", "On March 29, we kicked off a series of 16 launch events from New York City to London, Toronto to Milan. We were pleased to have host over 100 prospective channel partners along with 1,500 customers and prospects. We also use these events as an opportunity to demonstrate the extensive capabilities of the new portfolio to our direct and indirect sales resources and educate them on the new offerings.", "Customer and partner feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. The capabilities of our new smart workplace assistance resonates, addressing the need for security, reliability, solutions, mobility and a simple user experience. The ability to use apps to simplify common processes and even build unique apps tailored to an individual customer's needs has extended the role of our technology in the workplace. The positive feedback is starting to translate into orders, from single devices going into an SMB to large contracts with enterprise customers.", "Here are a few examples. A large U.S. energy company ordered more than 150 ConnectKey devices. A channel partner at Turkey signed a deal with a retail chain for 160 ConnectKey devices. A partner in the U.S. was selected to provide Managed Print Services to a school district with more than 1,800 devices, including 330 ConnectKey MFPs. And the last example, our government administrative department signed a three-year contract renewal and expansion worth over $15 million for Managed Print Service for over 9,000 devices, the majority of which are the recently launched ConnectKey devices. The increased functionality, the apps and the competitive cost has opened up new opportunities for us. We are capitalizing on the ConnectKey launch to amplify our channel expansion efforts.", "In the second quarter, we increased our distribution capacity through acquisitions and channel partner signings. In May, Global Imaging acquired multi-brand office equipment dealer MT Business Technologies of Ohio. MT was the largest independent reseller of Ricoh products as well as a partner of HP. And as I mentioned, we hosted over 100 channel partner prospects at our launch events. We're over halfway to our full-year goal and have added over 30 independent multi-brand office equipment dealers on a global basis. We are equipping our channel partners with tools and training they need to create new and accelerated revenue streams and closer, more lasting relationships with their customers.", "For example, we introduced two new marketing kits to help our partners generate awareness in local markets and drive demand for Xerox's broad technology portfolio, as well as their own complementary services, custom apps and deep expertise. Another way we are positioning partners for success is with the introduction of productivity packs for our ConnectKey multifunction printers. The productivity packs are prepackaged, high-value turnkey apps, designed to help channel partners capture revenue beyond hardware and supplies. Targeted industries such as education, health care and finance, the apps eliminate manual time-consuming and error prone tasks by converting paper-based processes into automated digital workflows.", "In addition, we have just announced the Xerox MPS accreditation program in the U.S. This is a recognition program for a select group of our most strategic Xerox channel partners who have demonstrated the desire and capacity to substantially grow their MPS business. The program represents a significant investment by Xerox in the tools and training to help these high profile partners find new revenue streams, which is core to our SMB market strategy.", "The press and industry analysts have taken notice and their feedback has been very positive; 400 articles have been written about the launch. There have been 20-plus product reviews, most focused on our entry-level A4 products. The reviews, including PC Magazine, ChannelPro Network, Buyers Lab and Better Buys have been overwhelmingly positive and will help drive awareness of our entry-level products.", "We have also collected a series of industry awards for our new products. Our VersaLink B7000 series and AltaLink C8000 series were named by Better Buys as its Editor's Choice Award in the A3 black and white MFP and high-volume machines categories, respectively. In its annual Summer Pick Awards, Keypoint Intelligence, Buyers Lab recognized four Xerox printer and multifunction printer lines, including three from the ConnectKey portfolio based on their productivity-boosting capabilities.", "We followed that up by winning their Buyers Lab PaceSetter Award in all three categories, MFP platform and apps ecosystem, document imaging security, and mobile print. While other vendors won some awards, we are the only vendor to sweep the awards and win in all three categories. And Quocirca again positioned Xerox as leader in worldwide Managed Print Services for the eighth consecutive year. As you heard in the customer wins I mentioned, the ConnectKey products are an integral part of our MPS solutions.", "So all in all, we're pleased with the reaction to our new portfolio and the early successes we've had. Our sales teams and channel partners are now equipped with an outstanding set of products and solutions, and we expect to see a favorable impact on our revenue later this year and into next.", "I'll now turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to cover our financial results in more detail. Bill?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning everyone. I will start on slide 6 with an overview of our financial performance. Overall, I would characterize Q2 as demonstrating operational progress, realized expanding margins and cash flow with a mix story on sales, where we had a significant amount of foundation building revenue generation activities, but we have not yet seen the benefits come through in the top line.", "Revenue in the quarter was down $226 million or 8.1% in actual currency, 6.4% at constant currency. We had anticipated, as stated during Q1 earnings, that Q2 revenues would be the weakest of the year, given product launch timing coupled with Q2 having the most challenging compare. That played out, driven by equipment revenue declines that were weak, given the significant product transition. Post sale revenue decline of 3.9% in constant currency was in line with the first quarter rates and our expectations.", "Turning to the cost ratios, we continued to see good progress. Savings from our strategic transformation program during the quarter more than offset the impact of revenue declines and a negative transaction currency impact of 100 basis points or $27 million, resulting in adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points. Within that, gross margin expanded 50 basis points. R&D as a percentage of revenue was flat and SG&A as a percentage of revenue was up 10 basis points as a result of the higher revenue declines.", "As stated last quarter, within our definition of operating income is equity income, almost entirely related to Fuji Xerox, which was down year-over-year. I should note that equity income in Q2 did not include any out-of-period impact from the resolution of the Fuji Xerox accounting practices review. It was determined that our share of the final Fuji Xerox adjustment of approximately \u00a540 billion was approximately US$90 million, which was higher than the original estimate of $30 million and deemed to be material to our current year financial results. Accordingly, we will be revising prior period results, including Q1 when we booked the estimated $30 million charge for that matter. We have provided in our materials the revisions for the past three years.", "Turning to the below the line items. Other expenses net of $34 million was $14 million better year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense. Tax rate of 27% was within our full-year range of 25% to 28% and was higher by 8.5% year-over-year, an approximate negative $0.09 impact year-over-year in the quarter to adjusted EPS. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.87, which reflects the one-for-four reverse stock split was down $0.11 from the second quarter of 2016, driven by the higher tax rate and lower equity income as cost and expense declines including lower interest expense roughly offset the impact of lower revenues.", "GAAP EPS was $0.63 in the quarter. The difference between GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring and related costs, non-service retirement related costs and amortization of intangible assets.", "Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. Starting with total revenue. From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 7.3% or 6.9% in constant currency and represents 60% of our revenues. International represented 35% of total revenues and was down 8.9% or 4.6% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets as we continue to see overall improvement in developing markets. The remaining 5% of our revenues are in other, with the largest piece over 50% being our OEM business.", "As I highlighted earlier, the driver of the higher declines in the U.S. and Europe was equipment revenue as post sale revenue trends were stable. Within total revenue, equipment sales were down 16% or 14.6% in constant currency with the highest declines coming in Managed Document Services and in the public sector, where sales cycles and product transitions and certifications are longer.", "From a product offering perspective, entry equipment sales were down 9.8% or 8.6% in constant currency, reflecting a higher mix of lower-value products as the strongest activity was in the developing markets and in the lower A4 product classes, as well as continued high OEM equipment declines. Mid-range was down 17.6% or 16. 3% in constant currency and this is where we saw the impact of not having the new A3 ConnectKey products available for the entire quarter. Lastly, high-end equipment sales were down 15.9% or 13.9% in constant currency as the growth with the high end in color Aqueous Inkjet was not enough to offset mono declines.", "Moving on, post sale revenue was down 5.7% or 3.9% in constant currency, which was consistent with Q1. We continue to see softer Managed Document Services revenues following weaker signings in 2016 and the first half of 2017. In Q2, Managed Document Services was 32% of our revenues and was down 6% in actual currency and 3.9% in constant currency, with $32 million of the $34 million decline driven by lower equipment sales reflecting the timing of the new product launch, which gets amplified in MDS, given the longer sales cycles and the natural lag for realizing signings and subsequent installation of the equipment.", "Declines are driven by the more mature large enterprise segment of the market as our SMB-focused channels, Xerox Partner Print Services and GIS, which comprise almost 25% of our MDS revenues, were growing mid-single digits. I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a few of which I've already touched on.", "Strategic growth areas to-date are down 0.7% in constant currency and comprise 39% of our total revenues year-to-date, a 2 point mix shift from the year-ago period. Growth areas were impacted in the quarter by lower equipment sales and MDS revenue. Jeff highlighted earlier, the headway we're making in advancing our strategic growth areas, and we continue to target our revenue mix to these areas by approximately three points this year.", "Turning to installs. Installs grew in entry, although at a weaker mix, given the better developing market performance, where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio and given the new ConnectKey A4 products that currently are available are at the lower end of the portfolio. Mid-range installs declined given the new product transition timing and more challenging prior-year compare.", "At the high end, installs were down in mono and within color results were mixed, with growth in Aqueous Inkjet offset by softer iGen activity, driven by last year's drupe-related partner and sales and a mix down within entry production color, where we didn't get a full quarter's benefits of the new Versant product.", "Signings in the quarter of $643 million were down 6.5% year-over-year and down 5% on a trailing 12 months basis at constant currency. We had strong contributions from renewals this quarter at a renewal rate of 86%. This was more than offset by lower new business signings. So we have work to do to improve the growth rates at MDS, especially in large enterprise. We have recently changed the leadership in MDS, and we expect investments, which include our new products and SMB expansion actions will drive improvement in revenues over time.", "The last key measurement area is strategic transformation. We're very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver our target $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important element of our strategy to drive both expanding margins and to support investments to improve our revenue trajectory.", "I get a number of requests from investors to expand on some of the actions we're taking under the program, and would like to take a minute to describe a few of the initiatives. Within facilities, we are consolidating locations, 79 thus far, with more planned at the balance of the year.", "As an example, we moved our headquarters to a smaller location at favorable terms, resulting in a couple million in annual savings. Within service delivery spend, about 30% of our savings program, we are consolidating our service delivery for MDS and break/fix taxable service under one management umbrella and optimizing our resources. We are leveraging more remote cell and cell phone technologies, which are further enabled by new generation of product. This will result in, among other things, greater dispatch efficiency and also enable greater machine uptime leading to better customer satisfaction and more pages printed and more revenue.", "In supply chain, we're negotiating with vendors for better terms and have outsourced activities. We've closed five major warehouses and a number of district part centers, which combined will drive around $24 million in annual savings once fully implemented.", "Within IT, we are consolidating vendors in areas like mainframe support, moving to shared environments and leveraging more cloud tools to enable greater customer self-service in areas like billing and collection. And within SG&A, we are advancing our resources to the smaller size of our business following the separation in driving to get some functional spend areas closer to benchmark. We've reduced spend that layers in a number of areas and we're leveraging more technology to become more efficient in how we get work done. We're also tackling legacy infrastructure areas like Europe, where historically, it's been more difficult to make changes, to streamline our operations and create more shared services in areas like selling support.", "Lastly, our transformation program is not limited to costs. We're applying the same program diligence to drive better revenue performance. Examples of some of these initiatives include using inside sales personnel to call an underpenetrated account and improving pricing tools and resources to give selling hours back to reps and minimize revenue lost on the table.", "So all in all, a very broad company-wide program with a rigorous process that we work at every day with the goal of not only driving margin expansion, but also in making us more efficient and competitive.", "Before covering cash flow, I'll cover the trends we're seeing in how we anticipate they will play out in the back half of the year. The total revenue decline of 6.4% in constant currency in Q2 was below trend as discussed, driven predominantly by equipment sales. We continue to expect full-year constant-currency revenue to be in the mid-single digits with about one point of negative translation currency, a modest improvement to our previous assumptions.", "Looking at the second half, consistent with our previous commentary, we expect improving equipment revenue trends. Q3 should improve over Q2, although we won't get the full quarter's benefit from all the new products or realize larger deal, mostly MDS benefits, given the inherently longer sales cycle on these deals. Thus, Q4 will represent peak revenue performance for the year, with further benefits extending into 2018 with post sale, which lags, should also begin to reflect benefits from our initiatives.", "Operating margins show good sequential and year-over-year improvement in Q2. Transaction currency again dampened margins in Q2 by about negative 100 basis points year-over-year. At current rates, we expect more moderate impact in the second half, especially in Q4. Overall, we anticipate continued strong margins in Q3, although seasonally, Q3 is not as strong as what we'll see in Q4, where typically margins peak for us. For the year, we continue to expect adjusted operating margin between 12.5% and 13.5%.", "Lastly, in looking at the trends for adjusted EPS with two quarters left, we are narrowing our full-year adjusted EPS to be between $3.20 and $3.44, essentially chopping out the top end of the range as that relied on a more rapid rollout of the new products. We expect EPS to follow the trend in revenue with peak performance in Q4. Q3 is seasonally the second weakest quarter of the year after Q1 and historically has made up about 24% of full-year EPS.", "I'll now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow generation coming in from continuing operations in the quarter was strong again at $343 million, up $84 million year-over-year. And free cash flow was $322 million, up $101 million year-over-year. Cash flow was driven by working capital timing and improvements, including in accounts payable related to the timing of supplier and vendor payments, the impact of lower equipment sales, a benefit to both accounts receivable and finance receivables, as well as the weighting of pension contributions to the second half of this year. Through the first half, we have contributed $46 million of a planned approximately $350 million for the full year.", "Investing cash flows were a use of $77 million and included $65 million related to a GIS acquisition and CapEx spend of $21 million. Cash used in financing was $80 million and reflected $68 million in dividends, both common and preferred. So overall, we continue to feel good about cash flow and are maintaining our full-year guidance of $700 million to $900 million in operating cash flow from continuing services.", "Turning now to capital structure slide, I will spend a few minutes on debt. We ended Q2 with $5 billion in debt, which is consistent with Q1 ending debt balance and lower than 2016 ending debt balance of $6.3 billion, reflecting the $1.3 billion of senior note debt repayments we did in the first quarter.", "As we highlighted previously, a focus area for us in 2017 is getting our capital structure aligned to the new Xerox. We have made good progress and we continue to look to ways to optimize our balance sheet. Of our $5 billion in debt, $3.6 billion is allocated to financing debt, calculated by applying a 7:1 leverage ratio to our customer financing asset of $4.2 billion, which are comprised of $3.7 billion of finance receivables and $464 million of equipment on operating leases. And I will remind everyone that this financing debt is adjusted out in one form or another by rating agencies when calculating our core leverage.", "So to summarize, we continued to make operational strides in Q2 with strong margins and cash flow and a good setup of revenue for the balance of the year.", "With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up the presentation with a few closing remarks. We are pleased with our earnings, margin, cash performance and the continued progress on our cost and productivity initiatives during the second quarter. Equipment revenue was softer as we work our way through the expansive product transition. We are laying the foundation in our strategic growth areas and we expect to see overall revenue improvement build toward the end of quarter three and then more strongly in quarter four and into 2018.", "Our new products have been well received and will support our pursuit of the growing A4 and Managed Print Services markets, while positioning us to enhance our share position in A3. The ConnectKey portfolio appeal to the SMBs who are supported by our growing ranks of channel partners and it favorably faces off against our competitors, enabling us to maintain our leadership across the board.", "And we're not taking our eye off the high end, where we're seeing good demand for our Aqueous Inkjet devices and new Versant products, while gearing up for PRINT 17 in the fall. Our strategic transformation program remains a critical focus to and continues to yield supporting strong margins and cash flow, while also enabling investment in the business.", "Additionally, as Bill mentioned, we're applying our proven process discipline to drive revenue improvements. Our progress through the first half, along with the work underway for the second half, gives me confidence in our ability to meet our 2017 commitments.", "We will now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, let me point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial details to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. For the Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for closing comments. Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I appreciate why you narrowed the top end of the range, just given you would need to see well above normal seasonality in the back half to hit the prior top end of the range. But curious why you didn't also narrow the bottom end of the range, which would require weaker seasonality despite the product cycles. And maybe just speak to the factors in the back half that would put you closer to $3.20 versus the upper end. Thanks.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah hey, Katy, it's Bill Osbourn here. Thanks for the question. So let me just give some thoughts to you on all the four measures that we give a little guidance on, on the adjusted EPS. But first of all, adjusted operating margin, we gave guidance at 12.5% to 13.5%, reaffirming that. We're very comfortable with where we're at year-to-date, 13.3% in Q2, first half at 12.2%. And just to remind everyone, the third quarter is typically our seasonally our second weakest quarter of the year, but Q4 is our strongest from an operating margin and from a revenues perspective. But we're still very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13. 5% range and believe we're set up pretty well for that.", "Revenues mid-single-digit down in constant currency for the full year; first half, we are 5.4% down. We believe the second half will be better than the 5.4% down at constant currency with once again Q4 being the strongest quarter of the year and Q4 being better than Q3.", "From an operating cash flow perspective, once again, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with where we ended for Q2 at $343 million, $533 million for the first half of this year. And I think most everybody knows and I'll just remind everyone the timing of our pension payments we gave guidance towards $350 million in pension payments for the full year, which is still on track, but only $46 million were made in the first half. So a lot of the pension payments are back loaded. There's also some timing of payables, with payables management that was a help in the first half that won't necessarily repeat in the second half.", "So then after all that getting to your question regarding the adjusted EPS and really, there a lot of factors as you can imagine that go into it. There are some favorable things in particular. Currency, we think based on current spot rates, will be a little bit better than we had expected as far as the headwind at the beginning of the year, in particular in Q4. And Q3 will probably be similar as far as the negative impact to the first half of the year, but Q4 we expect to have a more modest negative impact from a currency perspective.", "The Fuji Xerox provision is clearly a favorable item. And in the first quarter, we took that $30 million hit on that and that was revised $24 million or most of it was revised out. So, some favorable items there, but to get to the higher end of the range, a few things. We had \u2013 everything had to go right regarding the product transition, and Jeff, in a lot of his comments talked about that. A lot of things have got right, but not everything as far as the timing. There have been some delays. Also, we still plan. We've done a lot of investment year-to-date in the A4 area, which everyone knows has a negative margin upon the initial sale in most cases, but is profitable over the life of the equipment. We plan to have \u2013 we want to have flexibility, continue to do as much of that as we can. We've done a fair amount in first half. We want to continue doing that in the second half of the year. And this, leaving \u2013 to answer your question specifically, leaving the lower end of the range opened or not adjusting that leaves you opportunity to be flexible, where opportunities arise in the A4 area.", "And then, one of the bigger things is that, from a tax perspective, we gave guidance range of 25% to 28% for the full year for effective tax rate. And year-to-date, we've been in the 27% range. We think that might be lower a little bit with some things you see and maybe in the second half. But still, it is higher than the midpoint of the range so far this year. All those things factor in. We thought it was prudent to narrow the range, given half the year is up and we basically removed the top 25% or $0.08 from it.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Katy. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shannon Cross of Cross Research. Your line is now open.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much for taking my question. Can you talk a bit more about the pipeline that you have? I understand things have been pushed back and MDS is taking a while to train in a longer sales cycle. But I'm trying to figure out if this is a change to, sort of, the typical sales cycles? Or is that this is just more with regard to your product launch? And so I'm just trying to figure out how this delay that we've seen is either going to sort of just continue on and impact next year? Or if you think the weakness now is probably going to lead to some upside in 2018? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Hey, Shannon, how are you? This is Jeff. Yeah. So, let me take that one. So, as Bill indicated, we thought that Q2 for us was a bit softer by about 1 point. So if you were to take our total revenue and say 1 point, it's about $25 million. So finishing the first half on a total revenue decline basis at constant currency of negative 5.4%, if you were to ask Bill and I at the beginning of the year, that's kind of about where we thought we would be.", "As we look back, we said Q1 probably ended up a little stronger than we thought it would be, Q2 a little weaker. If you'd put the two together, it will be right where we thought we would be. Getting to the backlog, the reasons we feel more confident, especially in Q4, because \u2013 as we all know, Q3 is seasonally weaker. July and August is more difficult.", "From a direct backlog standpoint, we actually, from end of March to end of June, we see that up around 17%. We also look at the new business pipeline in Managed Document Services, which also gives us confidence of why that will turn probably more starting in the fourth quarter.", "The Managed Document Services, 180-day new business pipeline is up about 35% sequentially from Q2 to Q3. And again, that's a 180 day pipeline, which I say will \u2013 why it will benefit us more in Q4. If I look at the renewal of pipeline for Managed Document Services, that's also up about 13%.", "So when I look at those things and when I say the equipment this quarter for us down negative 14.6% constant currency, which is something we had not seen. And I get even more confidence in addition to the backlogs when I look at Managed Document Services alone because if I go to the last four quarters, equipment would've been in the range of, let's call it, flat to up 1%. This quarter, it was down 24%. It was a real anomaly.", "And when I look at the pipelines, it gives me good confidence again for Q4 and then into 2018. It might also help, although I know this really wasn't the question, but probably if I lay out the product introductions for everybody, I think that'd probably be a little helpful. So in February, we introduced the four lower-end A4 products, okay? That would be two color, two black and white. And that's why you saw the installs in entry, multi-function devices up 24% in color and 10% in black and white. And that's really where our developing markets benefited the most because it was really the entry level of A4, and we got a nice bump from that.", "In Q2, really end of May and throughout June, we launched all 17 A3 products, but they came in so late that really didn't benefit Q2 at all, obviously, because those are products that typically would go with Managed Document Services or have longer sales cycles. And we think as the third quarter progresses, we'll get some benefit. But again, really more of a benefit \u2013 more fulsome benefit across Q4 and into 2018.", "In July, we will introduce the four A4 color products, okay. And then in September, we'll introduce the last four A4 products, which will be the four black and white. And by the end of third quarter, all 29 products will be launched, which is why we believe Q4 will be our most fulsome for this year and then in 2018 will get the benefits of that.", "And certainly from a rollout standpoint, you get the fastest rollout through your indirect channels and your rollout through Managed Document Services and some of the enterprise customers due to testing, certifications and the government take a little longer.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you. Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Kulbinder Garcha. Your line is now open.", "Kulbinder S. Garcha - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC", "Thank you. Just a couple of questions. The first one is given all the initiatives that you have with respect to on the revenue side whether it's the product portfolio upgrade, the backlog that you mentioned, the initiatives of the channel, it sounds like \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 year-on-year growth should start to improve from Q3, get better in Q4, and does this product cycle of new initiatives drive fairly equally through 2018 as well, or are there other factors we should think about from just the secular challenges?", "And the second question is, I think we're halfway through this cost reduction program. And there's been talk of having greater than $1.5 billion of cost savings as you go through that, your margin performance is obviously quite good in this quarter just gone. When will you revise \u2013 if you will at all \u2013 and when we'll be told about that? Can you give us any insights the timing as to when you will assess whether you should be doing $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion or whether this is enough, and to what degree that depends on revenues? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, hey, Kulbinder, how are you? This is Jeff. I think I got most of it. We had a little bit of difficult time hearing you. So if we don't get all of your questions, just let me know and we'll be happy to do so. So, from an overall rollout from a revenue standpoint, we would expect in Q3 \u2013 certainly for the half year, as Bill said before, we expect to see improvements second half versus first half.", "In terms of Q3 versus Q2 sequentially, we would expect to see an improvement in revenue declines on a constant-currency basis, Q3 versus Q2 with the bigger impact being in Q4, which would be the seasonality but also having the benefit of all the new products for just about a quarter then. Some of the last A4 products will be coming out in September, so that might lag a little bit. But we do believe that will also help us, then, into the first half of 2018.", "With regard to the strategic transformation, I'll let Bill get into that in a little more detail, but we'll certainly update that as we get into the 2018 Investment Day. But as we've been saying all along and as evidenced by the 13.3% operating margin, even despite the 100 basis point currency headwinds, that's something we work hard at every single day and we'll update where we are at the Investor Conference.", "I should also mention and Bill did mention that in his remarks, we do are starting similar types of, what I'll call, operating initiatives on the revenue side to make sure we have the same diligence in introducing all these new products and rolling them out to the field. Bill?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Just a little bit on a strategic cost transformation. As everyone knows, last year we overachieved with respect to the $500 million target and achieved by $550 million. In 2016, we stated a goal for $600 million, this year we are very pleased with where we're at year-to-date, and believe we are firmly on track to meeting that target and hopefully exceeding it.", "Which would lead to, obviously, your $1.15 billion, if I'm doing my math right, that we're likely very much on the plus side of the $1.5 billion for the three years when you factor in 2018. But as far as formally giving an updated number, it'll probably be later this year. But we are very confident in being \u2013 hitting the $600 million this year and overachieving on the $1.5 billion. But to give updated three-year number later this year, we'll give that.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Kulbinder. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Hey. Thanks guys for taking the questions. A couple for me as well. Just sticking with that cost saves topic, guys, I believe of the $1.5 billion cumulative 2018 target, $500 million was incremental and $1 billion was sort of your business as usual saves. So my question is, of that $500 million in the context of the sort of the net new investments you've been making, how should we think or how would you like us to think about a potential for drop-through to the bottom line over the next couple of years? And I have a follow-up as well. Thanks.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. A couple of thoughts. So yeah, I'd agree, this incremental about $500 million over three years versus what was more BAU already on the cost reductions. But one of the main reasons why was to allow for investment and investment includes things like the A4s, being able to sell A4s up front, which are at a negative margin or a loss initially but profitable over the life.", "But it also offsets other headwinds, such as currency. We've had significant currency headwinds, both last year and this year, and the incremental amounts over the BAU allowed us to still increase margins despite those currency headwinds, and like I said, it allows us to do investments, so the investment in selling initial A4s or investments in the way we are doing things internally.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. And I think, Ananda, and good to hear your voice again on these calls. I should mention that, when Bill talks about investments, it's not just the new products, but it's what we're doing with the SMB expansion. We brought on more than 30 new partners and it's almost evenly split between the financial operations in North America, but it requires investment there. It's demand generation.", "We've hired dozens of new logo hunters. And as the year goes on, we hope to even do more A4 investment, because as we see the success of this, and as you know that's an investment putting those devices in, but we'll get the benefit on the post sale. So we could see ourselves doing more and more of that once we get even more comfortable than we are with where we are for the full year.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up on that. That's really helpful, guys. So, as we move through the next kind of two-and-a-half years here, well let's call it one-and-a-half into 2019, is the success \u2013 the return success, I'll call it, kind of the op income dollar growth impact from the incremental cost saves, the EPS growth impact from the incremental cost saves, will that be generated by the success of these new initiatives? Or will there be some portion of incremental cost saves that will not be reinvested back into new initiatives and it could be just it's a drop through to the bottom line?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, I would say clearly, it would be a mix that there would be a mix of investments. But some would continue to drop to the bottom line and we're not giving guidance in out years, but I would expect cost transformation, although maybe not at the same levels that you see in these three years, will continue as a significant part of this company's future.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. And another way, Ananda, I'd look at this, and this is I think where we laid it out at the investor conference. Just to make the math easier, let's just say on an $11 billion business or a $10 billion business, mid single digit declines would be 5%. So let's take $500 million, until you turn the revenue trajectory and we should not lose sight of the fact that when we started this 18 months ago and announced this program, it was not just to drive cost out, but it was to be able to reinvest back in so that we can change the revenue trajectory so that we're not declining at that mid single-digit level in the outer years.", "So right now, the cost transformation program is being used to offset the revenue decline and it's not just putting the margin, the 40% gross margin on the revenue declines. You have some price erosion in the industry, et cetera, which drops 100% to the bottom line. As we're able to take those declines from mid-single digits to something better, we'll have more opportunity to drop more to the bottom line as we also continue to reinvest.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Thank you. Jeff, just in terms of the competitive landscape, just wondering how you'd characterize the current pricing environment and if you've seen any response from any of your competitors just as your product launch continues to roll out?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hey, Matt thanks for the question. Yes, no, competitive reactions have been very stable. Pricing has been for us at about the same levels that it's been really for the last couple of years. If anything, where we're feeling really good is although the products are just coming out now, and again, we'll be coming out in Q3, but more fulsome in Q4, as we're speaking to the channel partners to bring on the SMB expansion, the reaction we're getting not just from the industry analysts or the awards we're getting, but from the resellers, the multi-branded resellers who are looking at these products and saying, we now understand that Xerox is very serious about going into the multi-brand channel.", "They've seen the hires we've made, that we've hired a gentlemen named Pete Peterson, Jim Morrissey, two people who are pretty well known in these channels, that they are going out and speaking to people. And where have seen some competitive reaction is saying, we now see the multi-brand channel speaking to Xerox now. We actually like it to be a little more low-key because we'd like to stay below the radar as we bring and these new multi-brand channel partners.", "So and again, we're not getting out ahead of our headlights. We're also making investments in our mono brand channel. These are the resellers who have been extremely loyal to us. We're continuing to invest with them. And we're also streamlining what we do in the enterprise. We're getting much more focused by saying, for years, there have been a number of customers that we've had \u2013 that we've called on directly that quite candidly, we shouldn't. We're going to work with our mono-branded resellers, our multi-brand resellers to have them call on them, do it more through telesales as we change our model, so that the new logo hunters can focus on the largest enterprise customers in the industry.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Matt. Operator, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thank you very much. I have two questions; I'll ask them both at the same time. First, you mentioned Q4 will be stronger than Q3. I wanted to get a little clarity about why are you calling that out when isn't that normally always the case? Or is there something special, because with the product ramps, I would think that Q4 would always be the strongest regardless of product ramps or not. And are you actually implying that maybe year-over-year sales could be flat to up in Q4? Or you just kind of reminding people of what's normal?", "And then my second question is, you narrowed your EPS guide by taking the high end down, but the operating cash flow and free cash flow didn't change at all. So what causes the bridge to where there was no impact to operating cash flow and free cash flow? Thank you.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Hey, Jim, it's Bill. Thanks for the questions. So, yeah, regarding the Q4 versus Q3 from a revenues perspective, a couple of things. You're right that Q4 seasonally our strongest quarter from a revenues perspective each year and that normally occurs. This year, we expect there to be even more of a ramp, the degree of it, we're not giving that specificity, but more ramp than normal because of the new product launch.", "Not giving specific guidance as to flat or positive for Q4, but as far as Q4, it's owned. But we do expect there's a normal ramp from Q3 to Q4 that occurs. We expect there to be more of a ramp this year than in prior years just because of the full availability of our products at that point in time.", "As far as EPS and operating cash flow, once again, there are a lot of variabilities, as you know, that go into operating cash flow. And one of them in particular is the pension contributions, and we've said $350 million. It's an area that we look at closely as far as our funded pension status. And just want to leave things open from the perspective of whether we want to have flexibility for maybe additional funding there. But yes, normally, all else being equal, you would \u2013 you could have a slightly less, actually operating cash flow because taking off the top, but it's not that significant compared to all the variables that go into determining it.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jim. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thank you. It's a two-part question. First of all, you mentioned some successful contracts at the beginning of the prepared remarks, Jeff. Were any of them competitive wins? And unrelated question, but as you move through the remainder of this year, is there anything you can share regarding channel and your own inventory mix? And to what extent you have some visibility into the 4Q ramp owing to a sell into the distributors and resellers? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. So \u2013 hi, Paul. Yeah. So certainly, some of those wins were competitive wins, no question about it. And we're putting even more and more of a focus on it, part of the reason in on Managed Document Services that our Q2 to Q3 sequential 180-day new business pipeline, which would all be new, is up 35%. It's these new logo hunters that we're hiring, many from the outside, some just targeting them on the inside. So they're building a competitive pipeline again and because it's a 180-day pipeline, we'll get some benefit from that in Q4 and then certainly some in the first half of next year as well.", "From an industry standpoint, we've been very \u2013 from an inventory standpoint, we've been very stable. That's something we watch very tightly. When Bill talked about working capital improvements and our cash flow, it's part of the rigor with the way we manage our business. And that's even with having \u2013 we just made the Global Imaging acquisition, where we actually buildup some inventory for that. When Bill talked about some of our closures of facilities or whatever, some of those could even be manufacturing facilities where we'll actually have a little \u2013 we built some inventory for that to manage through that. So even despite all that, we manage it very well and still with pretty significant cash flow improvements.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Paul. That's all the time we have for questions today. Thanks for your interest. Jeff, anything to wrap up?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yes. Thanks very much for all your questions. And as I mentioned last quarter, we are keenly focused on the work ahead of us. We are positioning ourselves to reverse our revenue trajectory trends. We understand the market and our success will come by methodically laying the building blocks to capture growing share of the workplace market and increase our participation in the expanding high-end color market. We continue to make headway on our strategy and we're confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We look forward to continuing to update you on our progress, and I thank you all for joining our call.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for participating in today's conference.

(NYSE:XRX) Q3 2017 Earnings Call October 26, 2017 10:00 AM ET", "Executives", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Analysts", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Operator", "Good morning, and welcome to the Xerox Corporation Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Release Conference call hosted by Jeff Jacobson, Chief Executive Officer. He is joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer.", "During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor. At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the expressed permission of Xerox. After the presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "During this conference call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein.", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Good morning, and welcome to Xerox's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. During today's call, we will provide an update on the quarter as well as our expectations for full year 2017. Overall, we delivered a solid quarter. Revenue decline improved sequentially and earnings expanded year-over-year, with margins and cash flow both in line with our expectations. We still have work to do, but we're making headway on our strategy. We're gaining traction in our rollout of our ConnectKey products, as September was our strongest month in the quarter. We also saw improvement in our Managed Document Services results. Both of these factors will help us pivot more over time to our strategic growth areas.", "Let me walk you through an overview of our third quarter financial results. Third quarter GAAP EPS from continuing operations was $0.67 and adjusted EPS was $0.89, up 6% from the same quarter a year ago. Adjusted EPS excludes $0.22 per share of after-tax costs related to the amortization of intangibles, restructuring and related cost as well as certain retirement related cost.", "Revenue of $2.5 billion was down 5% year over year or 5.9% on a constant currency basis. We are starting to see new equipment flowing through as we gain momentum into the fourth quarter and 2018. Post sale revenue was 79% of total revenue and declined 3.9% or 4.8% in constant currency. We expect stable post sale revenue coming over time as equipment revenue improves and placements grow.", "Adjusted operating margin was 12.2%, down 40 basis points year-over-year and in line with our expectations. Strategic Transformation benefits largely offset transaction currency and lower equity income, putting us on track to achieve our full year margin objective of 12.5% to 13.5%. Operating cash flow from continuing operations included $671 million in pension contributions. Bill will go into more detail on cash flow.", "Overall, we have made great progress this year optimizing our balance sheet, which will support both a strong cash flow in the future as well as our investment-grade credit profile. It's also important to note that excluding pension contributions, operating cash flow increased $44 million year-over-year, so good operating performance. And finally, we ended the quarter with a healthy cash balance of $1.8 billion, which includes the $475 million used in October for the early redemption of the 2018 senior notes. So overall, solid results that position us for continued improvement in Q4 and into 2018.", "Throughout the quarter, customer and partner feedback continued to be overwhelmingly positive, whether it's about our wide array of Managed Document Services, our industry-leading Graphic Communications Solutions or our new line of smart, secure ConnectKey enabled workplace assistants. This positive feedback translated into increasing ConnectKey orders in September from single A4 devices going into an SMB to large MPS contracts at the world's biggest enterprises. All 29 of our new ConnectKey office products are now available and shipping to customers around the globe, and with sales momentum building as we expected, entering the last quarter of the year.", "Here are just a few quick examples. A world leader in the pharmaceutical industry renewed and expanded a multiyear Managed Document Services contract across 76 countries, adding more than 2,200 of our new A3 and A4 ConnectKey printers. A channel partner in Italy secured an MPS contract with a leading chemical company, replacing 400 competitive printers with 300 of our new AltaLink and VersaLink devices. And in Switzerland, a leading professional services firm signed an MPS deal that includes 130 AltaLink and VersaLink devices.", "Applications are a clear competitive differentiator for our new ConnectKey workplace assistants, and we reached a meaningful apps milestone during the quarter. There are more than 0.5 million ConnectKey apps now installed on Xerox devices globally, marking a 66% increase since the product launches at the end of March. That is 200,000 additional apps have been installed on our new AltaLink and VersaLink MSPs since their introductions. This is significant, as the large majority of these apps ship with our new devices. So, it's another key indicator of that brisk customer adoption rate.", "Finally, ConnectKey is the only print solution containing the power of industry-leading McAfee security protection; McAfee whitelisting technology, which constantly monitors and automatically protects against malware attacks, comes embedded in all Xerox AltaLink products. We've chosen to partner with best-of-breed companies like McAfee instead of building our own capabilities. As almost all of our customers already use McAfee, they feel more comfortable that McAfee solutions are embedded in our platform.", "We're also squarely focused on the growth opportunities in the attractive high-end digital color part of the market, where Xerox has been a leader for more than a decade now. At the largest U.S. graphic communications tradeshow, PRINT 17 in Chicago in September, our industry-leading innovation was behind multiple product introductions, including MUST SEE 'EMS award winners, the Trivor 2400 High Fusion Inkjet Press and the iGen 5 Press with White Dry Ink. And sales were brisk with deals for the iGen, the Brenva HD Production, Rialto 900 Inkjet Presses as well as the new Versant 180 and 3100 Presses.", "Our third MUST SEE 'EMS award winner at the show was the Xerox Specialty Imaging, a fraud-deterrent technology that helps protect sensitive printed data. In September, we also announced a reseller agreement for Xerox to market and sell the Fujifilm J Press 720S, a sheetfed inkjet press in the U.S. and Canada. This further expands our inkjet portfolio with the addition of a wider format press.", "I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Bill Osbourn, to cover our financial results in more detail. Bill?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start on slide 6 with an overview of our financial performance, which I would characterize as showing progress and in line with our operating expectations, with the benefit of the timing of lower tax rate and the gain from Grenoble sale, more than offsetting lower equity income and placing us above our targets for net income and adjusted EPS.", "As Jeff reviewed, the revenue rate of decline modestly improved versus Q2, driven by both equipment sales and Managed Document Services. And we're beginning to see some positive revenue dynamics in currency, which had been a headwind for some time.", "Turning to profitability, adjusted operating margin of 12.2% was down 40 basis points as overall cost productivities only partially offset negative transaction currency, lower equity income and the impact of lower revenue. Within the adjusted operating margin, gross margin expanded, driven by post sales and the benefits of our Strategic Transformation program, which more than offset a decline in equipment gross margin, driven by transaction currency impacts that are lessening, but remain negative.", "R&D as a percentage of revenue was 10 basis points better, while SG&A as a percent of revenue was up 60 basis points year-over-year as a result of higher revenue declines and some headwinds, including higher compensation and benefits, only being partially offset by Strategic Transformation. Lastly, as stated previously, within our definition of operating income is equity income, almost entirely related to Fuji Xerox, which was down year over year.", "Turning to the below the line items, other expenses net of $17 million was $33 million better year-over-year, driven by lower interest expense of $13 million, not quite as large of a year-over-year benefit as last quarter, given the September note issuance, and a gain of $13 million from the sale of our Grenoble Research Centre that we announced at the end of June and which hit in the quarter.", "Adjusted tax rate of 19.4% was below our full year range of 25% to 28% and was lower by 3.6 percentage points year-over-year, driven by the favorable resolution in the quarter of a couple of tax matters, an approximate positive $0.03 impact year-over-year to adjusted EPS. Overall, adjusted EPS of $0.89 was up $0.05 from Q3 2016, as the lower tax rate and the benefits from our strategic actions more than offset the impact of lower revenues and equity income. GAAP EPS was $0.67 in the quarter. The difference between our GAAP and adjusted EPS includes our normal adjustments around restructuring related costs, non-service retirement-related costs and amortization of intangible assets.", "Turning to the next slide, I will drill down more on revenue. I'll begin with a few high-level comments. Equipment revenue declines in Q3 improved sequentially, as expected, with the strongest year-over-year performance in the quarter coming in September. The best performance in the quarter came in the developing markets and the U.S. in SMB-focused channels, including Global Imaging Systems, while higher declines continued in the longer decision cycle areas of large enterprise and public sector.", "Post sale revenue declined 3.9% or 4.8% in constant currency in the quarter. We saw improvement in supplies revenue declines and Managed Document Services revenue. This, however, was more than offset by lower other sales, including sales of third-party IT equipment and lower page volumes in some areas of the business. As previously noted, there is a lag between the installs of new products and the flow through to future post sale revenue improvement.", "And now I'll take you through some more details. From a geographic sales channel perspective, North America was down 5.2% or 5.7% in constant currency and represented 61% of our revenues. International represented 34% of total revenue and was down 3.1% or 5.1% in constant currency, reflecting higher declines in Europe that were partially offset by growth in developing markets. The remaining 5% of our revenues is in other, with the largest piece, over 50% being in our OEM business.", "Within equipment, mid range saw the greatest improvement sequentially, reflecting the full availability of new products. Entry and high-end, however, remained weak. Entry equipment revenue continued to be impacted by the lower mix of products and the transition to the new portfolio, as not all of the higher-value products were available for the full quarter. Additionally, we saw continued growth in developing markets; however, it decelerated as we lapped easier compares.", "Within high-end, we saw good performance in entry-production color from the new Versant products; however, that was more than offset by declines in other high-end product segments, driven in part by higher Q3 2016 sales, following the every four-year drupa tradeshow.", "Lastly, to round out the revenue discussion, we were pleased that Managed Document Services revenue turned back to growth, up 2.2% in actual currency or 1.2% in constant currency and comprised 34% of our total revenues. Within MDS, the SMB focused channels, XPPS and GIS which comprised almost 25% of our MDS revenues, grew double digits, while the more mature large enterprise segment, where we are the market leader, had modest declines.", "I'll now shift to discuss our key performance metrics, a few of which I have already touched on. Revenues from strategic growth areas to-date are flat in constant currency, an improvement from the down 1% for the first half and comprised 40% of our total revenues year-to-date, a two-point mix shift from the year-ago period. The improved performance was driven by the better MDS growth I just commented on, and we expect that trend to continue as the new product impact takes greater effect. We continue to target to shift our revenue mix to these strategic areas by approximately three points every year.", "Turning to installs, we saw improvement across most product areas in Q3. Installs grew in entry, although once again at a weaker mix, given the better performance in developing markets where units tend to weigh towards the lower end of the portfolio. Also driving lower mix was the fact that the higher end new ConnectKey A4 products were only fully available at the end of the quarter.", "Mid-range installs were flat in color and declined in mono. We saw sequential pick-up in a number of areas and we expect this trend to continue into Q4. At the high end, installs were down in mono, where the market continues to decline. And within color, results were mixed. We saw growth in entry production color and aqueous production inkjet, which was offset by declines in other areas driven in part by the drupa compare I mentioned earlier.", "MDS signings which, as a reminder, reflect only our enterprise business and don't include SMB, were $606 million in the quarter and were down 6.7% year-over-year and down 10.7% on a trailing 12-month basis, both at a constant currency. Renewal rate was 85% and overall in line with expectations. The year-over-year decline in signings was consistent with Q2. And looking forward, the 90-day pipeline shows good expansion year-over-year and we expect Q4 signings to improve from trend. Work remains to get back to consistent growth, but underlying trends are turning in MDS, supported by the new products and investments.", "The last key measurement area is Strategic Transformation. We continue to be very pleased with our results to-date, and we are on track to deliver at or above our target of $600 million of gross savings in 2017. This is an important program and one that underpins our strategy to expand margins and support investments to improve the revenue trajectory. We have a disciplined program, which as I expanded on last quarter, includes initiatives that span the enterprise. It's hard work and a never-ending journey, enabled by business and process improvement and simplification, evolving technology and optimization with partners.", "I'm often asked what will be the target for 2018 and whether there is an upside to the initial $400 million we laid out at our Analyst Day last year. Our sights are clearly set on continuing to drive productivity improvements, and we are currently building out the plan for 2018, which we'll be in a position to give an update on during Q4 earnings in January once we can finalize the baseline for what we accomplished in 2017.", "Before moving on to cash flow, I'll cover the trends and what we expect for the full year and fourth quarter. Total revenue decline of 5.9% in constant currency in Q3 improved from Q2, as we anticipated. On an actual currency basis, the improvement is greater as we saw for the first time in 13 quarters, currency turn to a benefit on revenue, a positive dynamic we expect will continue at least in the near-term. On a constant currency basis, we continue to expect full year revenue declines in the mid-single digits, with Q4 expected to represent the best revenue performance of the year.", "Operating margin was seasonally lower than Q2, but remained in line with our objectives and reflected a continued negative impact from transaction currency, 60 basis points in Q3, which we expect will moderate further in Q4. For the year, we remain on track to be within full year range on an adjusted operating margin of 12.5% to 13.5%, with peak margins in Q4. On tax rate, we are maintaining our full year adjusted tax rate guidance range of 25% to 28%, and we anticipate the Q4 tax rate to be at the higher end of the range.", "Lastly, and looking at adjusted EPS with a quarter left in the year, we are narrowing to the high range of our full year adjusted EPS range by $0.08, resulting in a revised range of $3.28 to $3.44, which implies an $0.84 to $1.00 range for Q4. This guidance reflects continued progress on our strategy and includes the necessary investments to position us well for the future. We benefited from the timing of the lower tax rate and Grenoble sales that both came in Q3 and we'll be taking a portion of that benefit to fund further investments in quarter four. These include our expectation of a greater mix of entry products that carry negative margin upon sale but attractive post sale margins down the line, as well as higher investments in both sales and infrastructure to support our 2018 objectives.", "I'll now shift to discuss cash flow. Operating cash flow was the use of $383 million in the quarter. The use of cash reflected significant pension contributions of $671 million in the quarter, which included the incremental voluntary $500 million we announced in September. The large pension contributions reflect our continued focus this year on optimizing our capital structure and on the pension side, narrowing the unfunded gap, which will be a benefit to future operating cash flows and will reduce future pension contribution variability.", "If you pull out pension from cash flow for both years, operating cash flow would be up $44 million in the quarter. The drivers of this underlying cash flow performance included: relatively flat year-over-year pre-tax profit; working capital, which was a modest higher use of cash year-over-year, reflecting the new product buildup and also a modest inventory increase due to the hurricanes; and financing assets being a greater source of cash as a result of lower equipment sales in recent quarters as well as lower financing penetration.", "Investing cash flows were a use of $4 million, with CapEx spend of $23 million largely offset by proceeds from the Grenoble sale of approximately $20 million. Cash from financing was $908 million and included proceeds from the $1 billion September senior note issuance, of which $500 million went toward the previously mentioned incremental pension contribution, and $475 million was used in October for an early redemption of a portion of our 2018 senior note. Financing cash flows also included $68 million in dividends, common and preferred.", "Before I go to the capital structure slide, I would like to spend a few minutes on updates we're making to our operating cash flow guidance. There are several moving pieces to cash flow that I would like to walk through in terms of their impact to our guidance.", "To begin, underlying operating cash flow is running above expectations, as just discussed, giving us confidence to raise cash flow guidance by $100 million. More than offsetting this increase is a reduction from the incremental $500 million contribution to domestic pension plans that was funded with debt, as we announced in September. Lastly, we are announcing that we will be eliminating the majority of our accounts receivable sales or factoring programs which will have an approximate negative $350 million impact to cash flow in Q4.", "As background, we have had in place since 2009 accounts receivable sales programs where we sell short-term trade receivables, generally with payment due dates of less than 60 days. This has had a nominal impact on cash flows in recent years, as the largest benefit comes on the program startup. We no longer have a need for this working capital tool. And as a part of our Strategic Transformation program to simplify the business and reduce costs, we are eliminating the majority of these programs. This will give us annual savings of approximately $10 million that does result in the one-time timing impact to cash flow that I just discussed.", "2017 has been a year of optimizing our balance sheet, and I view this as another positive step in improving our capital management that will benefit the business going forward. The net impact of these three changes is that we now expect cash flow from operations to be in the range of negative $50 million to positive $150 million for the full year 2017. This update to operating cash flow has essentially no impact on our available cash for capital allocation, as we always had an unallocated element of opportunistic spend in our guidance.", "We are also modestly adjusting our 2017 capital allocation to reduce expectations for CapEx by $50 million, as we are running under our full year target, with the shifting of some IT projects to be more pay-as-you-go operating expenses versus CapEx. At the same time, we are increasing our M&A target by $50 million, raising it to approximately $150 million. We have spent $76 million year-to-date and are targeting to close a couple more tuck-in deals before year-end.", "Factoring in all these movements, we continue to anticipate ending the year with a cash balance of over $1 billion. I feel good about the progress we have made this year in strengthening our capital structure and we plan to provide during our Q4 earnings call in January our capital allocation plans for 2018.", "Before I turn it back to Jeff, I will quickly touch on our capital structure. We ended Q3 with $6 billion of debt. Within that, financing debt remained largely consistent at $3.6 billion quarter-over-quarter; however core debt increased by $1 billion to $2.4 billion, reflecting the $500 million debt we took on to fund the pension and $475 million we used in October for the early redemption of a portion of the 2018 notes, replacing debt with a coupon of 6.35% with 3.625% coupon debt. The replacement of pension liability with core debt is largely leverage neutral. So overall for the year, we have improved leverage driven by the $300 million debt reduction we did earlier this year. And we will continue to manage our debt balance leverage position to maintain our investment-grade profile.", "So to summarize, we continue to make progress on our objectives and are on track to deliver on our full-year expectations. With that, I will hand it back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you, Bill. Let me wrap up the presentation with a few closing remarks. Our third quarter results reflect continued progress on key performance measures and put us on track to meet our full year objectives. Revenue trends are beginning to improve; however, we are still in the early phase in our strategy to turn the revenue trajectory. Our Strategic Transformation program is a critical enabler to supporting both revenue improvement and margin expansion, and I'm pleased with the strides we have made with opportunities still in front of us.", "And finally, I cannot overemphasize the importance of the work we have done on the capital structure front and the key actions we have taken, including paying down debt, putting more toward the pension and ending accounts receivable sales programs, which will make us an even more financially secure and strong company for the future.", "We'll now open up the line for questions. Jennifer?", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, I will again point out that we have a number of supplemental slides at the end of our deck which provide more financial detail to support today's presentation and complement our prepared remarks. During Q&A, I would ask participants to limit follow-on and multi-part questions so we can get to everyone. At the end of our Q&A session, I'll turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first comes from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Your line is now open.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Thank you very much. I have two questions. The first one is, given all of the movements on cash flow, can you give us an idea of sort of how you're thinking about 2018? I know you're not going to give specifics. But if we think about what the one-timers were this year versus what we will see next year, the fact that you sort of raised your operational cash flow guidance and reduced your CapEx for this year, just how should we think about the trajectory of cash flow for next year? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Hey, Shannon. It's Bill Osborne. Good morning. Hey, good question. So a few things. You're right, we're not going to give detailed guidance on 2018, but a few things to think about in light of what we've done this year. First of all, the factoring, just as I said in the prepared comments, are the ceasing of the sales of short-term receivables is a one-time timing issue. It is historically a pull-forward of short-term \u2013 cash related short-term receivables of 30 to 60 days. When you start up a program, it has a favorable impact back in 2009. This hasn't had much of an impact in recent years, plus or minus. But now that we're ceasing a majority of it, it will have that $350 million approximate negative impact this year. It will have no impact to run rate cash flow for next year.", "As far as other things to think about when you're looking towards next year. If you recall, we originally had talked about pension contributions over a two-year period being at the $800 million range; $350 million this year, $450 million next year. The incremental pension contribution we made this year with the debt that we issued in September brings down those future contribution levels to more normalized levels. Not to give an exact amount, but historically in the $200 million range, whereas I think before most people were modeling $450 million, $500 million for next year. But the thought is for it to be a more constant, stable number in the future in the $200 million range.", "As far as CapEx, our CapEx is primarily related to IT-type spend, and we've been seeing more and more as we go to cloud-based solutions that it's ending up being more OpEx-related IT than CapEx historically. I would still think we'd be in the CapEx range, $100 million, $150 million. M&A type deals we target, tuck-in type deals, especially in the GIS arena. And we've said that could be anywhere, $100 million, $200 million in a given year depending on the number of deals you're doing there. So those are sort of big picture type items with respect to cash to think about future years. But we'll be more explicit obviously in the January earnings call.", "Shannon S. Cross - Cross Research LLC", "Okay, great. And then can you talk about \u2013 I don't know, maybe Jeff, talk a bit about what's going on in terms of operating margin. It was a bit light this quarter. You mentioned on the SG&A side some pressure from higher compensation and things like that. How do we think about SG&A? And how do we think about the cost benefit rolling through so that you can be back in that range that you guided to for full year? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, so if you look at it, Shannon, as you know, we were 12.2% for the quarter and we're 12.3% for year-to-date. So our full-year guidance is 12.5% to 13.5%,so really within the expectations that we thought we would be. If we think about it, we had 60 basis points of currency headwinds. We had a little lower equity income on a year-over-year basis. The productivity came in where we certainly thought it would be and it offset our normal revenue declines. So we're really well on track for where we expect to be for our 12.5% to 13.5% guidance.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, I'd agree with everything Jeff says. Just to remind you, Q4 is seasonally the highest quarter of the year from an adjusted operating margin perspective. And based upon quarter-end September 30 rates, we do expect a moderating impact of transaction currency in the fourth quarter versus what we saw in Q3.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Shannon. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ananda Baruah of Loop Capital. Your line is now open.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning. Can you hear me okay?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hi, Ananda. We can hear you fine. Thank you.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, great. Yeah, two for me as well, if I could. I guess the first is just going back to the new equipment shift kind of across the portfolio that actually, I guess, drove volume up Q-over-Q. You mentioned a number of things. Could you guys call out or point out, I should say, which were specifically most impactful and which you believe to be specifically most impactful going forward? That would be really helpful. Thanks a lot. (30: 55).", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, sure, Ananda. So, yeah, let me try and cover it in a broad sense and give you the details so that everybody can have an overview of where we are. And again, I'd say, we're right on pace with where we thought.", "So if I were to look at the second half of last year from an equipment revenue standpoint as well as the first three quarters of this year, we've been down at 10% constant currency consistently awaiting for the portfolio to come out. So, as you know or I believe you know, the lower end of the A4 products or our entry products came out in the first quarter of this year. And what you're seeing is you're seeing the benefits of that in the installs. So our color installs were up 23%; black-and-white installs were up 26%. But that really benefited the most our developing markets where we're really mixing down into the lower end of entry. So our developing markets actually had growth.", "If you then think about the May-June timeframe or later in the second quarter is when we brought out all 17 of our A3 products. So we started to see some benefit from that and improvement to a decline of 8.5% in our mid-range products. And the benefits came, Ananda, I would say really in the shorter sales cycles. We'll start seeing more and more of that in the longer sales cycles, especially in the larger enterprise public sector, et cetera. But I would say even there as we indicated last quarter, our 180-day new business pipeline was up significantly and that's now migrated to continue to be up in our 90-day new business pipeline, which we said all along would benefit us in Q4.", "So we certainly expect overall to see our strongest equipment sale revenue in the Q4 as well as our strongest and significant improvement in signings in Q4. And we take some confidence in that based upon what we've seen in September and what we see in our direct backlog.", "With regard to the higher-end A4 products or the higher value, if I can call it that, A4 products, those came out more in Q3 with the final coming out in September. So we'll start seeing the benefit of that as well. So we've known all along that Q4 is where we need to start showing the significant improvement. We have confidence in that based upon what we we're seeing in the backlog, based upon what we're seeing in the pipeline, and based upon what we saw in September where we improved the decline in our equipment by more than half of what our normal run rate has been.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "And that's really helpful. And just a clarification on that. Where in that \u2013 just for our benefit \u2013 does the mid-production, light-production units like the Versant, which I think you guys were enthusiastic about, the Brenva, like that, where do they fall in that?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, so that would be in the high-end. So you saw the installs down 2% and you saw the high-end revenues down about 12%. The Versant did very well. So actually Versant did extremely well and the inkjet did extremely well. We had a tough year-over-year compare if you look at things like color press and iGen, because remember we were comparing against drupa last year which is the every-four-year trade show. So we expect to see improvement there in Q4.", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Thank you. And then just a quick second one is. Can you just give us some sense of where the cost savings \u2013 how you've chosen to use the cost savings year-to-date? That's it for me. Thanks.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. So from a cost savings perspective, really I group it into three buckets when I think about it. First of all, just to follow-on what Jeff was saying about the new A4s at the higher end coming available in Q3, fully available. As everyone knows, there's a razor blade model on the A4.So we've had the lower end ones available since pretty much the beginning of the year. The higher-end A4s came out in Q3.We expect to be selling those in greater quantities. And to the extent we do that, there are upfront losses upon sale. Typically that are made up \u2013 more than made up and profitable over the life of the equipment. So that's one area of investment that we expect to continue pushing an increase even into Q4.", "Second area, deals with IT infrastructure investments. And some specific examples, I said the spend is tending to be more OpEx than CapEx. And just due to the nature of the type of IT solutions we're doing. But first of all your channel partner business is an area of focus. It's a strategic growth area, and we're building up our back-office business platforms to support that business. Also our service delivery, we're looking \u2013 we're building up a next-generation service delivery platform. And then there's just other general IT infrastructure, whether it's with respect to supply chain, data analytics, et cetera. All those types of items support the business today and going forward we believe in the future.", "And then finally the third bucket that I view as far as just the type of investments really goes to the direct selling, are the selling costs, both from a direct sales force perspective. We've been increasing the number of direct sales people during the year, and plan to continue on doing that, and also the support of our channel partners and recruiting those channel partners are also \u2013 there's a cost to that that we believe will benefit the future.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Ananda. Operator, next question?", "Ananda Baruah - Loop Capital Markets LLC", "Great, thanks.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Coster of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. Two please with a sort of longer-term perspective to them. The first one is on the MDS \u2013 in the MDS segment, I think you said about 25% revenue now is coming from the midmarket. What can that share be over the course of time? And how do you get there?", "And then on R&D. Your R&D is still one of the biggest in the industry focused on printers. It feels like you've kind of been through a big product cycle. What's next? Are you going to start doing what some of your competitors are doing and move into adjacencies? Or is it just more of what we've seen to date? Some kind of breakdown of the R&D would be useful. Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Sure. Paul. Let me try and address that for you. So, first, from an MDS standpoint, we were very pleased that we improved from the decline of 3.9% last quarter to the growth of 1.2% this quarter. As we indicated last time, there was an aberration in the equipment sales where we were down 24% in MDS. That improved significantly with still more room to improvement. The post sale and MDS did grow, so we were pleased to see that, and our channel Managed Document Services was up about 12%. So good double-digit growth, stronger than the market there, actually twice as strong as the market there.", "As Bill indicated, the actions were taken there between the new products, our new multi-brand resellers, and the SMB expansion, in addition to the new logo hunters, and we brought in about 30 in North America. And we're not just adding feet-on-the-street in our own direct world, but our resellers are also adding feet-on-the-street, and we're helping support them in doing that. So we're making good progress there, and the SMB part of the Management Document Services is obviously a big part of our strategic growth areas.", "With regard to research and development, we're trending at about 4% of our revenue in research and development. That's been pretty stable. We've put a lot of time \u2013 we look at research and development in terms of capital, and everything needs a good return on investment. So to your point about where we will be pivoting, I don't think there's any question. One of the things that we're very excited about now that we're 10 months into the separation is having Palo Alto Research Center back 100% dedicated to us.", "For six years or seven years prior to that it was predominantly dedicated to our business process outsourcing firm, which was spun off. And now that's 100% back to us. So yes, we will be pivoting into things with more in inkjet, more in printed electronics, more in the Internet of Things, certainly more in the packaging. Now those investments will take a little longer time, obviously, because commercialization cycles are longer. But when we look at our business, our strategy all along was to say what we call Phase 1, be very strong on strategic transformation, make this business as productive as it can be, as cost-efficient as it can be, take some of that to the bottom line, take some of it to invest in the future.", "Phase 2 is exactly where we're at now. All these 29 new products coming out, and now let's begin to show the change in that revenue trajectory. Phase 3, we'll be pivoting to some of those things that I think you were just referring to, what can be the second and third leg in the Xerox stool going forward.", "Paul Coster - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Paul. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Katy Huberty of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Good morning.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "First, just a quick clarification. The strength that you saw in September, was that just the ConnectKey products? Or was that across the equipment portfolio? And then can you comment on whether that order strength continued into October? And then I have a follow-up.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, so. Yeah, we'll stay on Q3 I think is best, Katy. So it was in our 29 new products. And it was in also what I'll call the high end of inkjet and it was Versant. So we certainly saw it there with the new products that we brought out, both in the high end as well as in the 29 new products.", "As I said, the reason we have confidence is because of what we've seen with September. We actually had signings growth in North America. So we're starting to see some of the benefits of that. We're starting to see our pipeline build with our new logo hunters. And the products are just being very well received by our channel partners as well, especially with the app.", "So everything in terms of the detailed reviews Bill and I do with the team gives us the confidence that Q4 will show significant improvement in our equipment sales revenue line as well as in our total revenue line.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then just as a follow up, how are you thinking about the weaker dollar? Is there an updated view as to the currency impact to EPS in 2017? And then does that become a tailwind? Does currency become a tailwind in 2018? And would you expect to flow that through to the bottom line? Or do you take that upside and potentially reinvest it? Thanks.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yes, Katy, it's Bill. A couple things. I'll talk a little bit about Q4. Don't want to go too much into 2018 guidance yet. But as far as you look at quarter-end rates, we do expect moderation of the transaction currency impacting Q4 based upon quarter-end rates. And also from a revenues perspective, translation perspective, Q3 was the first quarter in 13 quarters that we actually had a favorable impact from currency, about 1 percentage point. And we're expecting that to improve into Q4 based upon quarter-end rates.", "So, yes, we are expecting a moderating impact or improvement with respect to currency. We look at -one of the things we factor into all the things, pluses and minuses, is that how much we invest into the company and how much we let go \u2013 drop to the bottom line. So can't really give you a specific answer on that component, but certainly it's one of the factors that we look at as far as incremental investment versus allowing it to drop to the bottom line. And 2018, we'll see where rates are at the end of the year, and we'll clearly have a view and comment on that in the January earnings call.", "Kathryn Lynn Huberty - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thank you, Katy.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you, Katy.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Operator, next question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Milunovich of UBS. Your line is now open.", "Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you. First of all, I want to talk about the M&A and the channel. Can you talk a bit about what you've seen in the dealer space in terms of valuations? Are you seeing competition from other dealers or private equity? And is consolidation in the dealer channel likely to affect industry dynamics in terms of either pricing pressure or the nature of contracts?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. So, Steve, how are you? This is Jeff. Yeah, so we've seen some consolidation or some resellers being acquired in Europe. And as you're probably aware, that certainly has been one of our strategies in the North American market with our Global Imaging channel. So we've done a few this year. It's part of our strategy as we go forward and as we look at M&A and our overall capital allocation strategy. As we go forward, it will probably continue as part of it.", "We also believe very much in some of the M&A. If we do \u2013 when we do it, we certainly want it to benefit the total business, and that could be an igniter from a technology standpoint as just being a channel acquisition.", "So \u2013 but channel acquisition is definitely part of our strategy. It's been very successful with Global Imaging. And what we are seeing is certainly the multi-brand resellers that we have that are \u2013 we're now bringing on and we've brought on about 45 so far, equally split between North America and international. They've been very excited about our new products because they're really looking at these as workplace assistants, coherency between our A3 and A4, mobility, benchmark security, cloud enablement. And then they're really leveraging the apps, which is what they like as well.", "Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. And then I just wanted to check in on the large enterprise space. It's fairly saturated with declining pages. Is there much risk that those customers shift over time to lower-cost A4?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Well, the industry to a large extent is moving to A4. But what we find there, that would actually benefit us to some extent because the vast majority of our business in the enterprise is now Managed Document Services. And when we didn't have as competitive an A4 as we do now, it caused us to put in more A3 when we were architecting the solution and therefore that would hurt our margins to some extent. So some of these deals that you are now seeing us win is very significant for us because we're able to put in more A4 devices, which is actually a benefit. Where you're starting to see some of the industry go down, it's more in the desktop printers, and we tend not to play there as much which is also a benefit for us and perhaps not as much to others.", "Steven Milunovich - UBS Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Steve.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Operator, next question?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Cabral of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Yeah, thank you. I wanted to circle back to the earlier discussion on the operating margins. I guess, looking at the implied Q4 guidance, if I assume an improving revenue performance to get to down mid single-digits, it still implies margins are flat to down year-over-year even to get to the high-end of the range. So I guess with that in mind, why wouldn't you start to see some better leverage given the revenue declines are improving and front-loaded restructuring that you had to start off the year?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. I don't think I want to get that specific within the range of 12.5% to 13.5%, Matt. But we've done our modeling and our expectations for Q4 and based upon \u2013 as everyone knows, Q4 is seasonally our best quarter of the year for revenue perspective, from an ESR perspective in particular and from total revenues and based upon what we expect to happen from a transaction currency perspective that we're very comfortable with the 12.5% to 13.5% operating margin range.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then Bill, as a quick follow-up, in the past you've talked about just potential that you see within working capital. Could you just give us an update on where you stand with some of those initiatives and if possible maybe quantify the size of the opportunity that you see over time?", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. So working capital, it is an area of great emphasis for the management and for the company. Inventory, receivables, aside from the ceasing of the AR receivables program, still managing receivables on an ongoing basis. Inventory, we're going through a period of time where we're transitioning product lines from the old to the new. It has some impact but we expect to work through that by the end of the year. So there's clearly opportunity there. We don't want to size the exact, but it's an area that we clearly believe we'll be able to work on.", "Matthew Cabral - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Matt. Operator, next question please?", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mark Moskowitz of Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning. Two questions if I could really quickly. I want to follow back up on the channel commentary to Steve's question. Can you give us a sense in terms of the A4 opportunity? Does that create any sort of conflict currently with your installed base of partners? And is that why you're having to maybe get more acquisitive? And then the second piece is around your confidence that equipment sales, the rate of decline can improve. Is that because you have more contracts in hand entering the fourth quarter or in the month of October than you have historically? Or what else gives you that confidence? Thank you.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Mark, I'm sorry. I just missed the last part \u2013 your original question on the A4 part broke up a little bit. Could you just repeat that part of it, please?", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Sorry about that. So I was just curious in terms of go-to-market with A4, as it is a little newer here with Xerox after being away from that market for a good number of years. Is it creating any sort of channel conflict with some of your partners? And is that why you're having to maybe increase the M&A expenses or expectations going forward because you may have to actually be more acquisitive related to A4 type of partners from a channel perspective?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "I see, thank you. Not at all. So no, it's been part of our strategy. Look, we only have about a 5% market share in A4 and when we were, what I'll call a two division company, basically we were managing the business more for profits, more for cash and we're still doing that, don't get me wrong, but we believe now that we have a much more cost competitive A4 portfolio with the 12 new products that we've just introduced, not only will it benefit us in Managed Document Services, as I said, it'll give us much more opportunity, especially with a coherency in A3 and it should actually improve our gross margins in that space because we'll be able to architect the solutions differently. It will also enable us to bring on more channel partners than we have in the past because we've always been the leader in A3 and everybody wants our A3 solutions. But now when resellers go to market they need both an A3 and an A4 solution. So we'll be able to provide both to them and the fact that we now have at least 45 new partners coming on with more to come, says that they really like what they're seeing in the products and there's a lot of excitement in it. And again, if you would \u2013 your second part of the question now?", "Mark Moskowitz - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "The go-forward.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "I think it was regarding confidence on Q4.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Oh, confidence in Q4, thank you. The reason we have confidence is when I look at the way that \u2013 the backlog that we have going into Q4 is the best we've been positioned certainly this year, and probably over the last 14 months. When I look at what we have in terms of the pipeline for signings which will benefit us from a signing standpoint in Q4 and then certainly into next year, when I look up at the new resellers that we're bringing on and when I look at our new logo hunters that are just going after new business, it does give us the confidence. And obviously seeing the September results that we had the benefit of seeing, it was a bit of a trend breaker for us over the last five quarters. So that's what gives us confidence.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Thanks, Mark. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jim Suva of Citi. Your line is now open.", "Jim Suva - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Thanks very much. Two questions, I'll ask them both at the same time. The first one is on the free cash flow guidance taking down. I think that was unexpected by investors and you clearly laid it out this quarter, but I guess the question is, you unexpectedly brought it down. I guess, are there other things you guys are considering that maybe we should be bracing for as we look ahead that could impact free cash flow for our modeling perspective? And then my second question is, on MDS you mentioned that the signings you expect to go up next quarter in Q4. Do you mean up year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter because I believe quarter-over-quarter it's generally up. Thank you.", "William F. Osbourn - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah. Hey, Jim, it's Bill. I'll answer the first question regarding the free cash flow guidance. The way that we look at it really is that the underlying cash flow actually we feel very good about what's happened year-to-date and the progress we've seen as far as underlying cash flow as a company, we actually raised based upon the original basis, the $700 million to $900 million range to $800 million to $1 billion based upon that.", "But as far as the surprise it's actually the $500 million when we did the debt, or note issuance back in September we disclosed that $500 million of the $1 billion note was going to be used for this and revised the cash flow guidance at that time for that $500 million which we view as a positive because it's allowing us to have more stable pension contributions going forward as opposed to having certain required amounts being higher like this year was $350 million, next year $450 million, $500 million. So we believe it will be more stable going towards the future so that's $500 million we put out there in the September timeframe.", "And as far as the ceasing of the short-term sale of receivables, we believe just from a strategic transformation perspective, the savings associated with that, whether it was the interest costs with the effect of borrowing or the administrative costs that that working capital management tool just wasn't for the needed except there's a limited part that's left and we see that as a positive from a savings perspective, $10 million going forward.", "So yeah, there is the one-time timing. But as I explained in Shannon's initial question, it's just the timing, pulled forward cash 30 days to 60 days. And as far as ongoing run rates, this really has no impact on 2018.", "And as far as other things being thought about or considered really nothing. I mean, I laid out some initial thoughts regarding 2018 cash flow considerations when answering Shannon's question and really nothing else other than that.", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "Yeah, and, Jim, on the signings, if you go from a constant currency basis on a year-to-date basis, we've declined about 7% with growth in the renewables and declines in the new business. We expect to see the new business improving in Q4, so we expect to have strong improvements versus the year-to-date signings we've seen in Q4 for sure.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Jim. That's all the time we have for questions today. We appreciate the interest of everyone who has tuned in. Jeff, anything to wrap up?", "Jeffrey Jacobson - Xerox Corp.", "I just want to thank everybody for your questions. As I mentioned last quarter, we are keenly focused on the work ahead of us. We're positioning ourselves to reverse our revenue trajectory trends over time. We understand the market and are successful come by operationally laying the building blocks to capture share of the growing workplace, marketplace and increase our participation in the expanding high-end color market. We continue to make headway on our strategy and are confident in our ability to meet our full year commitments. We look forward to updating you on our progress. Thanks so much for joining the call.", "Jennifer Horsley - Xerox Corp.", "Great. Thanks, Jeff.

He's joined by Bill Osbourn, Chief Financial Officer. During this call, Xerox executives will refer to slides that are available on the web at www.xerox.com/investor.", "At the request of Xerox Corporation, today's conference call is being recorded. Other recording and/or rebroadcasting of this call are prohibited without the express permission of Xerox. [Operator Instructions].", "During this call, Xerox executives will make comments that contain forward-looking statements, which, by their nature, address matters that are in the future and are uncertain. Actual future financial results may be materially different than those expressed herein. ", "At this time, I would like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Jacobson. Mr. Jacobson, you may begin.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Good morning, and thank you all for joining our call. We have two very exciting and important announcements to cover. First, today we reported strong fourth quarter results that demonstrate the successful execution of our strategic priorities. We also announced a transformational transaction in which Xerox will combine with Fuji Xerox, our long-standing joint venture with Fujifilm, to create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. We will spend the majority of the time we have today providing details on this value-enhancing combination. However, before we do so, I'd like to spend a few minutes taking you through the highlights of our fourth quarter and 2017 results. ", "Turning to Slide 6. I am pleased to report that Xerox had a strong quarter that reflects the significant progress the company has been making. We delivered improvement across all key performance metrics. Xerox generated $2.7 billion in total revenues during the quarter, up 0.5% year-over-year or down 2% in constant currency. This compares to a 5.6% decline on a constant currency basis through the first 9 months of the year and, as we anticipated, represented a meaningful improvement to our revenue trajectory. This was driven by a 5% increase in revenue within our strategic growth areas.", "Importantly, equipment sale revenue grew 4.3% or 1.5% at constant currency, which is the first quarter showing constant currency growth since the second quarter of 2013. This was enabled by our focus on capturing the growth opportunities in the marketplace. To do so, we expanded our channel reach, introduced new products for our graphic communications and high-end customers, and successfully delivered our largest ever new product launch. ", "Our Strategic Transformation drove solid operating profit margin of 14.4% in the fourth quarter, up 20 basis points over last year, while supporting our investments in future revenue initiatives. As a result of our improving performance, we realized adjusted EPS of $1.04, up $0.04 over last year. Note that due to an estimated $400 million noncash charge related to the enactment of U.S. tax reform, GAAP EPS was a loss. Our solid performance during the quarter enabled us to deliver on our commitments for the full year and put us in a position of strength as we enter 2018. ", "Turning to Slide 7. With these results in mind, I would like to take a step back and discuss the broader transformation that has been taking place at Xerox in the past year. When we held our Investor Day a little over a year ago, before the spinoff of Conduent, we laid out a comprehensive strategy focused on achieving two goals, first, increasing margins and enabling investment through our ongoing Strategic Transformation, cost and productivity program; and second, improving our revenue trajectory while increasing our participation in growing market segments.", "This was intended to create a new Xerox that is more competitive and better positioned amidst the changing industry environment. Our progress in 2017 is a clear demonstration that we are delivering on our commitments and our strategy is working. We made progress toward improving our revenue trajectory by focusing on the strategic growth areas in production color, A4 multifunction devices and Managed Document Services, which represented 40% of our full year revenue in 2017, up 2 percentage points over last year. ", "Our new ConnectKey portfolio received highly positive customer reception. Coupled with the expansion of our channel reach through the addition of 65 new dealer partners, this important launch drove improved fourth quarter equipment sales. We exceeded the annualized gross cost-savings target under our Strategic Transformation program by $80 million, reaching $680 million in 2017. As a result, we delivered operating margin expansion despite currency headwinds, while significantly enhancing our cost competitiveness. These cost savings also allowed incremental investments in our business and growth opportunities. ", "Finally, as previously announced, we took important actions to optimize our capital structure this year, including pension contributions and the elimination of account receivable sales programs. While these actions had a near-term impact on our cash flows, they will simplify our business, drive future savings and put us in a better position to immediately generate stronger cash performance. As a result of how well we executed our plans, we closed the year in a much better position operationally and financially than we entered it. And we feel great about the solid foundation we have built as we aim to deliver another year of continuous improvement in 2018.", "Turning to the next slide, you'll see a more detailed breakdown of the progress we have made on our Strategic Transformation program, which we initiated in the beginning of 2016. Our focused and disciplined process has delivered over $1.2 billion in cumulative gross cost savings to date against our original target of $1.1 billion by 2017. We expect to realize $1.7 billion in savings by year-end 2018 on a cumulative basis, exceeding the $1.5 billion we initially targeted. You'll find more details on our solid 2017 performance and 2018 guidance in the earnings release and supplemental presentation we put out this morning. We'll take your questions regarding our fourth quarter results during Q&A. ", "I'll now shift my focus to the transaction we announced this morning. Turning to Slide 10. This morning, we announced our agreement with Fujifilm to combine Xerox with our long-standing joint venture, Fuji Xerox. As many of you know, we currently have a 25% equity ownership in the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture, with the remaining 75% owned by Fujifilm. In many ways, Xerox and Fuji Xerox perfectly complement each other geographically and in our competitive strengths.", "Fuji Xerox is the leading player in the Document Technology business with an estimated $9.6 billion in 2017 revenue. They serve large, stable markets such as Japan as well as fast-growing markets in China and Asia Pacific. They hold the #1 market share in Asia and are widely recognized for their industry-leading R&D, manufacturing and sales platform. They also have a robust product portfolio, with 40% of revenues coming from growing market segments in Graphic Communications and Solutions & Services. ", "The transaction we are announcing today will bring together 2 companies and will create a global leader in innovative print technologies and intelligent work solutions. Together, we will be able to better innovate, compete in fast-growing markets and deliver significant benefits for our customers, employees and shareholders. ", "Before I explain the enhanced prospects of the combined company, I'll provide some background on what the joint venture structure looks like today and why we firmly believe that this is the best path forward for Xerox. ", "Moving to Slide 11. While the Fuji Xerox joint venture has certainly been among the longest lasting and most fruitful partnerships in the history of the technology industry, there are significant opportunities to improve the operational and financial aspects of the relationship. The transaction creates a combined company that will be dramatically stronger and more competitive than either company is on a stand-alone basis. I would like to highlight the key dynamics inherent in the current joint venture as we believe it provides important perspective into the value of this transaction. ", "Fuji Xerox is our most important supplier and a key partner in our R&D efforts. The company also has excellent manufacturing capabilities and an attractive technology portfolio with impressive solutions in inkjet, industrial print and workplace solutions. However, our ability to market and capitalize on these assets is somewhat constrained under the current joint venture structure for a number of reasons. Our inability to benefit from the growing Asian markets is an obvious one. But there are other inefficiencies and limitations that come with having 2 separate product portfolios, R&D road maps and supply chains.", "The combination will allow us to break down these barriers of value creation and align the long-term strategic vision of the 2 companies. We will also be able to remove duplicative costs in R&D and corporate functions, and fully consolidate our supply chain to improve our cost position globally. This will significantly improve our global go-to-market competitiveness, which should drive increased revenue opportunities.", "By gaining uninterrupted access to each other's IP and technology, we will be able to expand the breadth and reach of our offerings and streamline product portfolio strategies to better coordinate our innovation road maps. We believe this is the natural evolution of our joint venture with Fujifilm and will create a much more efficient partnership structure, driving toward one common goal of delivering world-class, innovative solutions for customers.", "For further background, shareholders can find additional information about the current structure in the 8-K we filed this morning, which includes the existing joint venture agreement. ", "Let's move to Slide 12 for an overview of what this transaction means from a financial and valuation perspective. We believe this transaction has the opportunity to unlock substantial unrealized value for Xerox shareholders. Xerox shareholders today own 100% of Xerox, which includes our 25% equity ownership in the Fuji Xerox joint venture. We neither control nor consolidate this equity stake in our income statement, and it is carried on the balance sheet at book value. Besides the operational inefficiencies I just described, this structure creates complexity in reporting as well as in how our investors model the joint venture interest. We believe this is resulting in a valuation disconnect in the marketplace about the true value of this joint venture interest. ", "Consolidating the entire Fuji Xerox with Xerox will allow us to create a much simpler and clearer financial profile and realize the full value of this joint venture interest. Investors will be able to see our global financial results on a consolidated basis and value it appropriately. ", "At the time of closing, Xerox shareholders will receive a $2.5 billion special dividend or approximately $9.80 per share. Beyond this substantial immediate cash return, they will own 49.9% of a much stronger and more competitive company. Further value will be created by capitalizing on significant growth and margin expansion opportunities, including $1.7 billion of cost savings by 2022, including $1.25 billion attributable to transaction cost synergies and $450 million attributable to Fuji Xerox's cost-reduction program.", "To demonstrate the value that will be unlocked through these transaction synergies, here, we have applied an illustrative industry multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA to 100% of the $1.25 billion cost synergies. Our shareholders will get the benefit of 49.9% of that amount. When we discount that to today, that would equate to about $12 per Xerox share. This new value represents nearly 40% of our share price, and that's on top of about $9.80 per share of cash dividend, making this a highly value-enhancing transaction for our shareholders.", "Let's now move to Slide 13. We have been taking decisive actions to better position Xerox and have considered multiple options and scenarios to drive greater shareholder value. We firmly believe that this combination is the best way to create value for our company and shareholders. Here are the reasons why. By combining with Fuji Xerox, we are creating a global industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, adding significant scale and reach to our current market leadership. We believe this is the right strategic evolution of our long-term alliance as it will allow us to optimize the current operating structure for greater efficiency and global competitiveness.", "We are projecting to deliver substantial cost savings for the combined company totaling at least $1.7 billion in annual savings, with $1.2 billion to be achieved by the end of the second year post close. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to delivering revenue growth, with direct access to fast-growing geographies as well as the ability to participate in future growth markets such as industrial printing and emerging intelligent work solutions.", "Combining the IP strengths and world-class R&D capabilities of the 2 companies will drive innovation in areas that customers are most focused on and which will address future demand. In addition, we will be able to leverage Fujifilm's highly value-added intellectual property portfolio and innovation capabilities. And finally, we will have increased financial flexibility to deploy capital towards strategic growth investments and capital returns over time. I will detail each of these compelling reasons for the combination shortly. But before that, I want to delineate the value-enhancing component of this combination for our shareholders. ", "Moving to Slide 14. We see the value this transaction will create for Xerox shareholders as two-fold. First, Xerox shareholders will receive a significant and certain value in the form of a $2.5 billion special dividend immediately at closing, which is more than 30% of Xerox's unaffected share price as of January 10. Second, and more importantly, shareholders will become owners of a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects, significant margin expansion opportunity and a balance sheet that provides financial flexibility to invest in future growth, while delivering attractive capital returns to shareholders. By combining, we're immediately increasing the value of our shareholders' investment. ", "Turning to Slide 15. We are excited to be creating this new company with our joint venture partner of 56 years, Fujifilm. We have had a great partnership over the years and look forward to leveraging that history to ensure our new company's success. Both Xerox and Fujifilm leadership teams have significant experience executing large-scale transformations, which will be highly valuable in executing the integration of the two companies and achieving our ambitious goals for the new Fuji Xerox. ", "Slide 16 provides a snapshot of the combined company. The new Fuji Xerox will have truly global scale with $18 billion in revenue, presence in over 180 countries and already-established leadership positions in fast-growing markets. We will have a total market opportunity that is currently estimated at $120 billion, with an additional $100 billion future opportunity in adjacent markets in industrial print, leveraging our combined technologies. ", "Innovation is in the DNA of both companies. Bringing them together will create a global innovation powerhouse with world-class research and development capabilities and industry-leading IP. And the financial profile of the company will be enhanced with an accelerated path to growth, significant cost savings and margin expansion opportunity, leading to high-teens operating margin and free cash flows of approximately $1.5 billion by 2020. ", "Before I go into further detail about the combined company's long-term creation opportunity, I'll touch on a few details of this transaction on Slide 17. As I've mentioned, our shareholders will benefit from owning a part of a much stronger and more competitive company, with significantly-enhanced prospects for revenue growth and margin expansion. This will be supported by an expected investment-grade credit profile at closing. The combined company's capital return policy will be aligned with Xerox's current plan, maintaining a $1 per share annual dividend and at least 50% of combined free cash flow returned to shareholders.", "As for the governance and leadership team of the combined company, I will have the honor to lead the combined company as CEO. I am pleased to announce that Shigetaka Komori, Chairman and CEO of Fujifilm, will serve as Chairman of the Board of the new Fuji Xerox. Mr. Komori has been a transformational leader at Fujifilm, having successfully reinvented the company. We will build a world-class management team, pulling from a deep talent at both companies. The new company board will include 7 directors appointed by Fujifilm and 5 independent directors from the current Xerox Board. The combined company will be named Fuji Xerox and trade on the New York Stock Exchange under our current ticker. We believe it is important to retain our brand's strengths in our operating regions, which is why we will continue to go to market as Xerox and Fuji Xerox in our respective regions. We expect to meet the conditions and obtain the necessary approvals to complete the transaction in the second half of 2018. ", "Turning to Slide 19 and the strategic rationale I outlined a minute ago, I'd like to take a few minutes to walk you through a bit more detail on the many reasons why this deal is so compelling to Xerox and our shareholders. ", "Turning to Slide 20. As I mentioned before, we're excited to create an industry leader with approximately $18 billion in annual revenue, which puts the combined company in the top ranks of global print technology businesses. Establishing this leadership position is especially important in today's competitive environment, which requires broad global reach and scale to be able to effectively and rapidly meet customer demands around the world. Bringing together the geographic, product and innovation profiles of these 2 companies will amplify our market leadership and enable us to more effectively compete for global deals and provide opportunities for future share gains. ", "Turning to 21. This combination also creates significant cost saving and margin expansion opportunities. We expect to deliver our $1.7 billion in annual cost savings in total through 2022, with $1.2 billion of the total cost savings expected to be realized by the end of the second year post close. The total cost-saving target includes $1.25 billion in transaction synergies as well as a separate cost-reduction program that will be implemented at the existing Fuji Xerox joint venture and is expected to generate $450 million in annual savings. These amounts are all in addition to Xerox's ongoing Strategic Transformation cost productivity program. Given our proven track record of driving operational excellence and efficiencies, as well as our long history of working together with the Fuji Xerox team, we are very confident of our company's ability to deliver these savings. ", "I will now go into more detail on the sources of these savings on the next slide. Of the $1.7 billion in total annual cost savings, a large portion of the reductions will come from cost of goods sold through supply chain optimization, such as manufacturing, sourcing, procurement and vendor consolidation. We also identified significant opportunities from the elimination of duplicative corporate functions and R&D spend. Finally, the Fuji Xerox joint venture is commencing a cost-reduction program immediately, which is expected to deliver approximately $450 million in annual cost savings by 2022. This program is specific to Fuji Xerox and is incremental to the synergy opportunities I just discussed. It will focus on driving efficiencies in manufacturing, R&D and SG&A as well as product portfolio optimization. We expect these efforts to be front loaded, with more than 70% of total savings being delivered by year 2 and 85% by year 3. ", "Moving to Slide 23. This transaction is extremely compelling from a revenue standpoint as well. The combined company will have an improved revenue profile, with a greater mix of revenues from fast-growing markets in Asia Pacific. As you can see, Fuji Xerox currently has a strong presence in growing markets such as China and the rest of Asia as well as #1 share in Japan.", "As I noted earlier, the combined company will have a nearly $120 billion market opportunity compared to the approximately $85 billion we were able to target as a stand-alone company. Upon completion of the transaction, Xerox will have the opportunity to participate in these markets while benefiting from Fuji Xerox's established leadership position and market know-how. The combined company will also have an accelerated path to future revenue growth as we integrate, including the ability to leverage each company's deep customer relationships, regional networks, shared IP, product portfolios and complementary distribution and service capabilities. ", "On Slide 24. With 6 world-class innovation labs globally and nearly 11,500 patents, the new Fuji Xerox will have world-class R&D capabilities. Fuji Xerox's expertise in areas such as automation, security and analytics, will be highly complementary to Xerox's hardware and materials technology. Combining these existing assets with a nearly $1 billion R&D annual spend will enable us to sharpen our focus on innovative print technologies and work solutions, with the aim of accelerating our participation in the more rapidly-growing markets. Together, we will be well positioned to lead the future of printing and enterprise technology and capture next-generation growth opportunities. ", "With that, I'll pass it to Bill to provide more details on the financial profile of the new Xerox.", "William Osbourn", "Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. I will start with an overview of the new company's financial profile and long-term targets, which will help clarify the significant value we're creating through this combination. As Jeff explained, the transaction we announced today will create a stronger company with enhanced growth prospects and margin expansion opportunities. And as you can see on this slide, we are expecting a rapid acceleration of the combined company's financial performance over the next 4 years. While we made significant progress toward improving our revenue trajectory over the last year, we continue to experience revenue declines. The combination with Fuji Xerox will allow us to accelerate our growth by providing access to key growth markets, unlocking synergy opportunities and leveraging each other's competitive advantages. ", "We're starting from a base of $18.2 billion in pro forma combined annual revenues, and we expect to return to revenue growth by 2020. From an operating margin perspective, the cost-savings opportunities we identified will drive significant margin expansion over the next 4 years, with the majority also being realized by 2020. As we begin realizing the benefits from the targeted cost savings, we expect to achieve industry-leading operating profit margin in the high-teens by 2022, which compares to a blended margin rate of 10% on an adjusted basis in 2017. It is important to note that the lower operating margin rate for the combined company versus the 12.8% for stand-alone Xerox in 2017 is primarily due to backing out equity income and royalty revenue from the Xerox margin and adding Fuji Xerox in at a lower margin. ", "We expect total restructuring charges of $1.4 billion related to the targeted transaction synergies and Fuji Xerox's separate cost-reduction program, which will be incurred predominantly in the first 3 years, in line with the progression of cost savings that Jeff walked you through. These will impact cash flows in the first few years, but the new company will continue to generate robust free cash flow, which is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2020. Additionally, we anticipate approximately $80 million in annual tax dis-synergies associated with the transaction. ", "Finally, we expect the transaction to be EPS accretive in 2020. Overall, this transaction clearly enhances the financial profile of both Xerox and Fuji Xerox. There is a very significant synergy opportunity over time, and this transaction allows us to go after both revenue growth and cost far beyond what we could do alone. ", "Turning to capital structure and balance sheet. A preliminary high-level view of the pro forma capital structure of the combined company results in $1.8 billion combined cash and $8.6 billion total debt on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2017. This includes the transaction-related cash outflows of $350 million needed to pay down a mandatory pension contribution triggered by the transaction and debt associated with the $2.5 billion special dividend to Xerox shareholders at the closing, which will be funded by bridge financing that has been secured. Following the announcement and before the close, the new Fuji Xerox plans to put in place permanent financing, including an amended revolver. All Fuji Xerox and Xerox debt is expected to be retained in the combined company's balance sheet post transaction. ", "As mentioned, the combined company will have a robust cash flow generation capacity, particularly beyond 2020. This will further strengthen the balance sheet and provide more financial flexibility for the combined company for attractive capital deployment, which I will discuss on the next slide.", "The new company is expected to have an investment-grade credit profile and is committed to maintaining this over time. And the new Fuji Xerox will uphold the principles that currently underpin Xerox's disciplined return on investment approach. With an investment-grade credit profile, the combined company will have broad access to capital markets and the financial flexibility to support all its operations. We will remain committed to delivering an attractive capital return to our shareholders. The new Xerox will maintain the current Xerox's $1 annual dividend per share as well as the target to return at least 50% of free cash flow to shareholders.", "Moreover, our increased cash flows will enable us to make M&A growth investments. Having the financial flexibility to seize value-creation opportunities is key to our strategy of returning to revenue growth. Over time, the new company is expected to have greater capital deployment opportunities toward targeted growth initiatives, increased dividend and share repurchases. ", "With that, I'll turn it back to Jeff.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Thank you, Bill. To conclude, today is a significant moment in the next chapter for our company and shareholders as well as the industry. The strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 performance we announced not only showed clear progress on our stand-alone strategic goals, but also provides positive momentum for the future and a solid foundation for the combination with Fuji Xerox.", "We are energized by the opportunities inherent in taking our Fuji Xerox joint venture to the next level, combining 2 industry leaders in unlocking significant value while unleashing innovation for future revenue streams. The proposed transaction will create substantial value to Xerox shareholders through a combination of an immediate special cash dividend and the opportunity to realize value from the future growth of a significantly stronger combined company.", "We are excited about the progress we have made at Xerox and the resulting performance improvement. While we work to finalize this transaction, we at Xerox remain committed to continuing our progress and further strengthening the company as we move into 2018. ", "With that, I will hand it over to Jennifer.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Thanks, Jeff. Before we get to your questions for Jeff and Bill, I will point out that we have posted on our Investor Relations website the full set of our normal earnings slides to provide you with the details around our fourth quarter results. [Operator Instructions]. At the end of our Q&A session, I will turn it back to Jeff for a few closing comments.", "Operator, please open the line for questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from the line of Shannon Cross with Cross Research.", "Shannon Cross", "Thank you very much and congratulations on the deal. I just want to walk through quickly so people -- so I make sure I'm correct on exactly what you're getting. So effectively, if you're a Xerox shareholder today, you're getting $10 a share in the dividend, you're getting $12 effective benefit from a synergy that you expect to receive in the next few years and then you get 50% share in a company that for fiscal -- or sorry, for 2017, generated about $2.6 billion in EBITDA and you expect will maintain an investment-grade balance sheet.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "So Shannon, it's Jeff. Thank you, and I think you've summarized it very well. So again, it's a $2.5 billion dividend that we have said is about $9.80 per share. There will be $1.7 billion in total cost reduction. That's the $1.25 billion in transaction cost synergies, plus the $450 million from Fuji Xerox. If you put a normal industrial multiple of 7x to 8x EBITDA on the $1.25 billion, I think we get to the numbers that you stated. And then they get 49.9% of a growing, thriving company that you mentioned. So I think you've nailed it pretty well.", "Shannon Cross", "Okay. I just want to make sure because I'm getting over $50 a share in value, so I just wanted to make sure that was correct. So with that then, can you talk a bit about, as we look at the company over the next couple of years, you've laid out synergies, but how are you thinking about, first, how the company is going to operate together? What are your first sort of focuses to make sure that go-to-market remains very consistent and then you can continue to see improvement, for instance, on the equipment sales side of things? And then can you talk a bit about like the goalposts we should look for? So again, we know synergies. But beyond that, are there things that we can look toward to see that this combined company is effectively executing?", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes, sure. So Shannon, the most exciting part of this is, as you said, it's the go-to-market and it's the innovation aspect. The cost synergies drive tremendous value that you delineated in the question you gave. What I really like about this is when you go through integration, people worry about the integration complexity. What we're doing now is we get to participate in growing markets. So Xerox participated in about an $85 billion market that was declining at about 3%. We now have access through Fuji Xerox to a $36 billion market that's growing at 2%, with very large shares in China, Asia Pacific and Japan. And the beauty is we don't have to worry too much about complexity of integration or go-to-market because the go-to-markets for the most part will stay exactly as they are. What I get really excited about is when I look at the innovation and getting into the new markets by combining technologies.", "One of the things in unlocking the value is we tended to have duplicative R&D. And now we're going to be able to divide and conquer. We'll be able to take the 6,500 engineers that this combined company has, that produces about 1,500 patents a year over the last few years and accelerate innovation in the areas of industrial print, which is a $100 billion market that is untapped for us today. You know the packaging market very well, flexographic corrugated labels, folding carton, that's still very much an analog market that's not digital. We can take our print technologies and move them into the area on non-paper substrates, printing on objects, virtual reality, Internet of Things, machine learning, voice activation for multifunction devices. So while the cost synergies will provide the value that you delineated, the future is all about the innovation and the growth and the access to the growing revenues.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Katy Huberty with Morgan Stanley.", "Kathryn Huberty", "Thank you. My congrats as well both on the quarter and the deal. I guess two questions. One, do you have a view yet as to whether Xerox's largest shareholders would be supportive of this deal? And then secondly, you just did a good job walking through some of the innovation and revenue synergy opportunities. How quickly do you expect Xerox to take advantage of some of the IP end markets that Fuji plays and that Xerox does not? Is that something you see happening over the next couple of years? Or are those growth opportunities beyond 2020?", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes. So let me take the two-part question, Katy. So first, regarding the largest shareholder, we have not spoken. Obviously, this is a transaction that's been in the works for many months, so we have not spoken on that issue. So we just don't know, and we only know what we read at this point. With regard to integration and access, one of the exciting areas, if you were to look at inkjet as an example, right now, we have separate strategies for Fuji Xerox on inkjet, Fujifilm on inkjet, Xerox on inkjet. And you definitely know very well, Fujifilm has tremendous IP in the areas of inkjet heads, certainly ink capabilities as well, and we'll be able to leverage those. When we've talked about it and through the conversations we've had through this negotiation with Fuji Xerox, but certainly with Mr. Komori and the team at Fujifilm, one of the things was about how do we divide and conquer, how do we take the best technologies of what was all three companies and unleash it so that we can apply people who are working on some of the things I talked about, like in Palo Alto Research Center, whether it's augmented reality, Internet of Things, machine learning; and then we have people in our Yokohama facility in Japan working on the other things that we need to.", "Now we do need to be a little careful because this will be the integration phase. So there are certain things we're allowed to discuss and work on, and there are certain things we cannot. So for the next few months, and we expect to close this transaction sometime in the second half, we can only do a lot of planning. And then hopefully, we'll hit the ground running upon the close.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Ananda Baruah with Loop Capital.", "Ananda Baruah", "Congratulations from me as well. Look, there's a million questions. I'll try to keep it short here, so I'll bundle. So do the synergies include -- the cost synergies, do they include what were the existing synergies or are the existing synergies incremental? And then I guess why not, if I read this right or heard this right, why not non-GAAP accretive in 2019 if you're closing in '18? And I might try to squeeze a follow-up in.", "William Osbourn", "Yes, a couple of things, Ananda. First of all, regarding the synergies. The $1.7 billion, the $1.25 billion combination synergies in addition to the $450 million cost-reduction program at Fuji Xerox, that $1.7 billion is in addition to our ongoing Strategic Transformation program, which we and our regular earnings document that Jeff went through briefly, up to $1.7 billion over the 3 years, approximately about $475 million. So those are in addition to the $475 million that we were doing in Strategic Transformation on our own. As far as accretiveness in 2019, there are -- there's a benefit, the synergies will be coming through relatively quickly as we're incurring costs upfront to obtain those. But our analysis is that we will be getting it in 2020.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes, Ananda, let me give you a little background on that as well. Because if you think about it, one is on the $2.5 billion we're going to have interest on the dividend. The equity income, we will no longer get. And then in order to do this deal basically, we're doubling the amount of shares, so if you think about it from that standpoint. So if you were to look at Xerox today, and let's just use a round figure about $8 billion market cap, and we deduct the dividend of $2.5 billion, let's value Xerox from that standpoint at $5.5 billion, we then double the share count; and that $5.5 billion, by doubling the share count, buys us 75% of Fuji Xerox, implying the $7.3 billion value. Now knowing the company and having worked with them as long as we have, we certainly view the intrinsic value as much more than $7.3 billion. So -- but it's really -- there are three factors, we normally get the equity income, we're doubling the shares and interest on the dividend.", "Ananda Baruah", "Got it. That's helpful. And then just last one real quick. The free cash flow generation, I think you guys mentioned $1.5 billion to start. And then I think there was a remark that, but it will be greater than that, and it would seem that it would have an opportunity much stronger than that. So could you just give us some context around that remark?", "William Osbourn", "Yes. I don't want to give specific guidance out beyond 2020. But looking at the significant cost of $1.4 billion that we'll be incurring to effect the synergies predominantly in the first three years, we don't expect those to be continuing on. And absent those costs, we would expect even significant free cash flow over and above the $1.5 billion we cited.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Matt Cabral with Goldman Sachs.", "Matthew Cabral", "So on the $1.7 billion in savings for the combined company, Jeff, can you just talk a little bit more about just how you arrived at that number? And how we should think about the net amount of that dropping through versus what you think you'll have to reinvest in the business over time?", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes. So we've actually done a lot of work on that, Matt. And we've had numerous meetings throughout this negotiation process, and we've done a lot of work with both Fuji Xerox and Fujifilm, outside advisers, et cetera, as we worked through this. So the way I would look at it is, first of all, the total $1.7 billion, and again, that will be in excess of what Xerox is already doing as part of our Strategic Transformation program, that $1.7 billion will be by the end of 2022. Of that $1.7 billion, about $1.2 billion will be by the end of the second year post close, so let's call it 2020, which would be 70%; and 85% of it would be by the end of 2021 or the third year. Most of that $1.25 billion will flow right to the bottom line, okay? So the vast majority of the -- so I'd say on the $1.7 billion, somewhere in the neighborhood of about 80% will flow through the bottom line.", "Matthew Cabral", "Got it. And then just a clarification, a follow-up for Bill. So FX was a nice tailwind to revenue in Q4. The revenue guidance you gave was on a constant currency basis. Can you just help us understand how you're thinking about, as of today, the FX impact on both revenue and operating margins for 2018?", "William Osbourn", "Yes. We have modeled that in, obviously, to our guidance. And we do see it, based upon recent rates being a tailwind both from a translation currency perspective in '18 and from a transaction currency. As far as effect on profits, we're estimating that at least a $50 million tailwind and -- could be higher based upon recent rates for 2018.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jim Suva with Citi.", "Jim Suva", "First, a question about the fundamental Xerox relationship as it is today, just stand-alone; and then second, more about this new relationship. So first of all, this year and -- well, in 2017, you launched several new hardware products. Just can you update us on how they're going? I believe they came out a little more staggered than what you thought. Are they completely all out the door now and into your retail distribution VAR channel? Or are they all trained? And when do we hit kind of the sweet spot of the most traction from those? And then I'll ask a follow-up question on the Fuji Xerox after that.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes, thanks, Jim. No, for the most part, the products rolled out just as we thought they would. So as we discussed before during Q2, there were about 4 A4 products that came out. So by the end of the first half, we had all 13 A3 products and 4 A4 products. And in the third quarter, we had the remainder of the A4 products come out. So if you remember at the last earnings call, we said we had some confidence, but we didn't want to get out too far ahead of ourselves. But based upon what we knew about our September equipment results, we had some confidence. The fact that, and I think the evidence is at constant currency, we grew our equipment sales revenue 1.5%, which was the first time since second quarter 2013 that the company has grown their equipment sale revenue line. So it's being very well-received. Our channel partners are growing to the tune of about 65 last year. And we're pleased with the trajectory and where things are moving.", "Jim Suva", "Yes. But my question was, is the quarter that you just printed, is that the quarter where basically, they're all in the channel, all your VARs are selling them and distributors are selling them, is that -- and that's kind of the best that it gets? Or is that kind of the early ramp of it, and in 2018, they really hit with a lot more force than even what we saw in this quarter, Q4?", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes. So Q4 was the first impact that you had seen. Admittedly, it was coming off of a Q4 2016, if I remember, was down about 10%, a little bit of an easier compare. When we get to Q1, what you'll see is we were down about 5.7% at constant currency Q1 2017, compares now to these, we'll get into some relatively easier compares in Q2 and Q3. Q2 2017, we're down 14.6% at constant currency. And then Q3, we were down again double digit, but the thing is people ask all the time, is this something where you'll get four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of it? And one of the things -- we will get the normal four-quarter or five-quarter of benefit out of the new products, but the multi-brand expansion strategy is the thing that will prolong this for a while. And the reason I say that is I keep coming back to this $15 billion multi-brand reseller market that we really never participated in.", "We only had about 1% market share. And as we can continue to grow the number of multi-brand reseller partners there, every share point is worth about $150 million. I'll also mention that as a result of the transaction, as we're going through best practices with Fuji Xerox, they have a similar, similar issue from the past where they haven't focused on multi-brand resellers. And it's an area that they're going to explore, too, which is part of the beauty of bringing these 2 companies together is comparing the best practices. As I mentioned before, their market shares in Asia are much higher than our market share. We're going to adopt their best practices as well.", "William Osbourn", "Just a follow-on to Jeff's comments, Jim, just we gave full year guidance in the regular earnings materials that we believe is very strong full year guidance. But just we've historically given -- look, we don't give quarterly guidance, but we give sort of expectations. And just from a revenue perspective at constant currency, we said full year down 2% to 4%. We would expect, just given it is a more challenging compare, as Jeff said, Q4 was a good -- I mean, Q1 last year was a good quarter, we'd expect to be near the lower end of that 2% to 4% on the full year guidance in the first quarter. And as far as our adjusted operating profit margin, our 13% to 14% in the full year is due to seasonality that we expect to be slightly below the low end of that range, but are fully confident in being within the full year range of 13% to 14%. As far as adjusted EPS, historically, we gave -- well, we gave guidance for next year of $3.50 to $3.70, $3.60 being the midpoint. And historically, the first quarter has typically been about 18% to 20% of the total, just to give people some guidelines what we're expecting in Q1.", "Jim Suva", "Okay. And then my quick follow-up is, are there any governmental approvals or antitrust or just any type of government approvals aside from the shareholder approvals we need to just keep an eye on for this pending transaction?", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Well, any transaction of this magnitude, Jim, always has to go through government regulatory review and then shareholder approval, as you said.", "Jim Suva", "Right. But can you let us know which ones those are specifically, if you happen to know? Or we can do that on a follow-up call.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "[Indiscernible] would be the most notable.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Paul Coster with JPMorgan.", "Paul Coster", "To start, Bill, any view on where the debt will be issued and what kind of debt will be issued to support this? And Jeff, the more substantive question for you really is, is there any risk here of in product harmonization near term of one or other of the regions being disrupted, the clients kind of not being clear on what the product strategy is and there's some potential dislocation -- very short term?", "William Osbourn", "Thanks, Paul. Just a couple of things on the debt. As we said in our prepared remarks, we'll be issued at investment grade; we're confident on that. We have bridge financing that is committed to. We will, between now and the close, be looking to potentially issue public debt associated with the $2.5 billion dividend. But details on that to come, but we are evaluating.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes. And Paul, on the second part of your question, actually, it's a very fair question and one that most people would think about. In this case, we actually have benefit of bringing the 2 together, and the reason is this. Our 2 companies, even though they were separate, we combine R&D, we combine manufacturing, we do it for each other, but we actually make the same product. So the beauty of it now is now we'll go to things like a common controller so we won't have separate front-ends. We'll have synchronized introduction of new products. So as an example in the past, Fuji Xerox might roll out a product, and we wouldn't see it in our territories till a year later. We're going to have opportunities of also synthesizing our supply chain. When I look at areas, the thing that really excites me because -- while I've never run a manufacturing facility, I've run companies that had very -- been very intense in supply chain and manufacturing.", "When we look at gross margin percentages, what happens is people always focus on price, and that's very important. But if you go back to the last three years at Xerox, our gross profit percentage has been relatively flat at 40% in a market that has price decline. The way we do that is we really get a lot of absorption and sweat the assets in our factories. We will have an even greater ability now to fill our factories in both locations, to sweat the assets, to get the right absorption, which is a real benefit of bringing that together. And again, as I mentioned before, the coordination between our R&D centers to unleash innovation, we'll be able to compete much more effectively on global Managed Print Services' deals to increase our win rates, best practice in shares. And then also, we won't have what I'll call the sharing of margin between the 2 businesses, which will be able to make us much more competitive on a global basis because we're not splitting the margin any longer.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Do you have another question, Paul?", "Paul Coster", "No, I'm good.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Operator, I think we have time for one last question.", "Operator", "Our last question will come from the line of Steve Milunovich with UBS.", "Steven Milunovich", "So it looks like there's elimination of a lot of current inefficiencies. Are there going to be any issues in terms of integration, particularly in R&D culturally? You've got two headquarters. What are you thinking about organizationally in terms of dealing with that? It's been kind of an arm's-length relationship in the past. Now it's going to have to be much tighter.", "Jeffrey Jacobson", "Yes. Steve, actually, so first, I never want to minimize integration because integration is always complex. But again, this is a 56-year partnership, so everything we have done over the decade has been joint R&D, joint manufacturing, joint product development. Our people know each incredibly well, and they've been doing this together for a long, long time. So instead of it truly being 2 separate companies that have never worked together, this is a case where if we introduce a product that came from Fuji Xerox in the past, it was with great involvement from the Xerox people and vice versa. If it was Xerox introducing the product, it was with great involvement from Fuji Xerox. So from that standpoint, I think it'll be relatively seamless compared to most integrations.", "Steven Milunovich", "Okay. And I just want to ask about the sales margin, which was down. Is that because you're moving into more A4-type equipment? And where do you expect that to be heading?", "William Osbourn", "Yes. Clearly, we have a commitment to A4, which on the upfront has a lower margin than our A3 and high-end products. And -- but we do believe that, obviously, over the life of that equipment, that it is a very attractive margin. But upfront, as we are committing and building up our A4, we seem to feel there is some negative impact on margin.", "Jennifer Horsley", "Great. Thanks, Steve. That's all the time we have for questions today.
