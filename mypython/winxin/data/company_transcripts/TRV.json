We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 20, 2017.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.", "In addition, other members of senior management are in the room, including Bill Heyman,", "Chief Investment Officer; Michael Klein, President of Personal Insurance; Tom Kunkel, President of Bond & Specialty Insurance; and Greg Toczydlowski, President of Business Insurance.", "Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the [ explanatory ] notes included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "One final note before I turn it over to Alan, as a result of recent SEC insurance industry guidance relating to the use of terminology, what we previously referred to as operating income, we now refer to as core income. As we explained in the press release, we have also relabeled related terms. To be clear, this is a wording change, and there were no changes in the calculation of these amounts.", "And now Alan.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported core income of $614 million and core return on equity of 10.8%, both of which are impacted by $226 million of after-tax catastrophe losses. About half of those losses arose out of storms occurring in the last 2 weeks of March. That kind of weather volatility is certainly in our playbook, but we'd normally expect it a few weeks later in the second quarter.", "To give you some context, according to the National Weather Service, reported hale, tornado and wind activity in the quarter was almost 2.5 times higher than the 5-year average. The quarter also had 12 PCS wind and hail cat events, an all-time record for Q1. That surpasses the record that was set just last year. As sometimes happens in this business, the weather in the quarter obscures what was otherwise a very good start to the year.", "Our underlying combined ratio was strong at 91.7%. Importantly, our Personal Auto bodily injury losses were within expectations and the same is generally true for loss trends across all our businesses. In addition to underlying underwriting profitability, we were also pleased with our investment results this quarter with net investment income increasing 9% over the prior year quarter.", "Turning to production. For all our business segments, we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace, including the record level of premium we wrote in the quarter. In our Commercial businesses, the markets in which we operate remain stable. We continue to achieve historically high levels of retention of 85% in domestic business insurance and 88% in Bond & Specialty Insurance. Renewal rate change improved somewhat over recent quarters, and as always, what's important is the texture underneath the headline numbers. For example, in our core Middle Market business, renewal rate change improved more than 1 point compared to the first quarter of last year. And during the current quarter, Middle Market renewal rate change was positive on 59% of our accounts compared to 53% of our accounts in the prior year quarter. This is the result of our efforts to seek rate selectively and thoughtfully to meet our return objectives in light of the persistently low interest rate environment and the fact that rate change has been below loss trend for a few years now.", "It's a similar story in our Management Liability business. Contrast that to our Select business, where rate change has been positive and stable for 3 quarters but modestly below where it was a year ago. Given the returns in this portfolio, we were comfortable with the renewal rate change and pleased to see retention in new business levels up, both sequentially and year-over-year.", "In Personal Insurance, we are encouraged that so far we have been successful in implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we discussed with you last quarter to improve profitability in our Auto business. And we were very pleased to have maintained momentum in growing our profitable Homeowners business. All in for the company, net written premiums were up 5% compared to the prior year quarter.", "Brian will take you to the production data and top line results in more detail, but I'll note that, to a very large degree, the growth reflects a combination of higher levels of retention and higher renewal rate change. That speaks to the quality of the premium growth.", "During the quarter, we were pleased to have announced our agreement to acquire Simply Business, a technology company and a leading digital provider of insurance to small businesses in the United Kingdom. In addition to a number of immediate benefits, like a profitable and growing business in the U.K. and access to talent with leading expertise in digital commerce in our industry, this is a medium- and long-term strategic transaction for us. It's about building important capabilities. It's digital R&D that will give us important insights into serving our customers and working more efficiently with our distribution partners. It's about making sure that we're positioned to serve the customer however, whenever and from wherever they choose to engage with us. We would have undertaken to develop these capabilities in any event and teaming up with the company and people that have been at it for over a decade and that are leading the way, gives us an important head start.", "Our agreement to acquire Simply Business is an example of our investing thoughtfully and strategically in the business, building on the meaningful competitive advantages that have enabled us to deliver industry-leading returns over time. And just as we have for more than a decade, we'll make investments like that for the long term and continue to right size capital by returning excess capital to our shareholders. There's no change in our capital management philosophy. While Jay Benet will have more to say about our capital management, I'm pleased to report that as a reflection of confidence in our business, today our Board of Directors declared a 7.5% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.72 per share. This marks the 13th consecutive year of dividend increases. Our board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.", "So wrapping up, weather was a factor this quarter. But the underlying results of the business were strong, we're well positioned for continued success over the near term, and we're excited about the investments we're making for sustained success over time.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. Core income was $614 million, down from 698 million in the prior year quarter and core ROE was 10.8%, down from 12.5%. There were several moving pieces this quarter, so let me spend a few minutes providing you with some further insight into these numbers.", "I'll start by saying that the absolute levels as well as the reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by underlying performance, rather they reflected the relatively high level of tornado hail that Alan discussed, along with the impact of the so-called Ogden rate adjustment, the U.K. Ministry of Justice's decision to reduce the discount rate applied to lump sum bodily injury payouts from a plus 2.5% to minus 0.75%.", "Beginning with underwriting, Cat losses were $226 million after tax, $19 million higher than the already high $207 million after tax in the prior year quarter. Page 4 of the webcast provides an analysis as to how our first quarter results compared to analyst estimates and, as best as we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses appear to be significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Net favorable prior year reserve development, which I'll discuss in more detail shortly, was 44 million after tax, which was $75 million less than the prior year quarter, mostly due to Ogden.", "While remaining strong, as evidenced by a 91.7% underlying combined ratio, our underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter, primarily due to two things. The first was normal fluctuations in non-cat weather and other loss activity. And the second, as we had anticipate it, was the timing impact of Personal Auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we had recognized in the second half of 2016. Partially offsetting these reductions in the underlying underwriting gain, but not impacting the combined ratio, was a $39 million tax benefit from successfully closing out our federal income tax exams for 2013 and '14.", "Turning to investment results, which was strong. Net investment income of $480 million after tax increased by 9% or $41 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non fixed income NII increased by $59 million after tax, primarily due to strong private equity returns more than offsetting the fully anticipated $17 million after tax decrease in fixed income NII that was driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year development was $81 million pretax, driven almost entirely by Business and International as compared to $180 million pretax in the prior year quarter. The quarter included the previously announced reserve increase of $62 million pretax that resulted from the Ogden rate change. Since this reserve increase primarily related to our public liability and commercial auto liability lines of business in the U.K., approximately two thirds of which are in runoff, any impact of this Ogden rate change on our future operating results is expected to be insignificant. Excluding the impact of Ogden, Business and International had net favorable reserve development of $133 million pretax, up from $93 million pretax in the prior year quarter and driven once again by better than expected loss experienced in Workers' Comp and General Liability.", "Bond & Specialty had net favorable development of $10 million pretax, while Personal Insurance had no prior year reserve development, which was an improvement from the unfavorable development we experienced in the two most recent quarters. On a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter.", "Operating cash flows of $775 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion at year end 2016 and higher than normal for us. This increase in holding company liquidity resulted from moving the excess capital that was generated by our highly profitable fourth quarter 2016 from our operating companies to the holding company, coupled with our decision to moderate share repurchases in first quarter 2017 to provide financing flexibility for our pending acquisition of Simply Business. As Alan said, there was no change in our capital management strategy.", "In the coming weeks, taking into account then current capital market conditions, we'll finalize our financing plans for Simply Business, which will likely include some combination of debt and internal resources. And once we've made that determination, we'll return remaining excess capital to our shareholders. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.3 billion pretax or $0.8 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $84.51 and adjusted book value per share of $81.56 increased 2% and 1%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.", "We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $286 million of our common shares this quarter, including $225 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $61 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.67 to $0.72 per share and authorized an additional $5 billion in share repurchases.", "With that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business and International Insurance. Segment income was $468 million, with a combined ratio of 96.3%, a strong result even with the impacts of above-average catastrophe losses and the $51 million after tax related to the Ogden rate adjustment. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 94.5%, up a little more than a point compared to the first quarter of 2016, due to normal quarterly variability in weather related and other loss activity, along with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing. Net written premiums for the quarter of over $4 billion, a record level, were up 3% year-over-year. Domestic Business Insurance premiums were up 2.5 points, driven by strong production results in Select and Middle Market. International net written premiums were up 6%, due primarily to the timing of certain adjustments in the first quarter of both years.", "Turning to Domestic Production. Our focus continues to be on retaining our business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at historically high levels. Renewal premium change came in at 2.8 points, up 0.5 point from the fourth quarter of 2016 and included positive renewal rate change of about 0.5. New business was $532 million, down from a very strong prior year quarter.", "Looking at the individual businesses. Beginning with Select, where we continue to make product and technology investments to drive growth. And we're pleased with the progress we're making as evidenced by this quarter's production statistics. Retention of 83% has remained at historically high levels for three consecutive quarters. Renewal premium change was over five points and new business premiums of $121 million was the highest level since the first quarter of 2012.", "In Middle Market, our results reflect a continued stable marketplace. Retention of 88% was at historically high levels, while renewal premium change was nearly three points and included about a point of renewal rate change. Our new business writings continued to reflect our underwriting standards and return objectives, and although down from last year, were in line with our expectations. The combination of strong retention, positive RPC and solid new business levels resulted in meaningful premium growth during the quarter.", "In Other Business Insurance, renewal premium change was up slightly compared to the fourth quarter of 2016 with renewal rate change that was flat. Retention came in at 79% and new business premiums were $121 million. In International, production was also very strong in the quarter. Retention improved to 84%, while renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business volumes are strong. So all in for the segment, it was a good start to 2017.", "I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter of $129 million was strong, though down somewhat from the prior year driven by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development, partially offset by the segment's portion of the tax item that Jay mentioned earlier. The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was very strong and unchanged from the prior year. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up slightly for both Surety and Management Liability. In our Management Liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention for the quarter again came in at historically high levels at 88%, while we continued to add a substantial level of new business.", "Renewal premium change of 4.4 points was up from recent quarters, reflecting a modest increase in average policy duration along with improvement in the rate component of RPC.", "Shifting from the financials, I'd like to comment on 2 things that we did in the quarter to advance our product offerings. First, we added to our expertise in Surety by bringing on board Family Business Institute, a specialist in strategic planning services for closely held construction businesses. We also entered into an agreement with Symantec Corp. to provide our cyber policy holders with leading cyber risk services. These actions will allow us to deliver additional value-added services to our customers, further enhancing our industry-leading product portfolio. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and our position in the market.", "Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter, with a combined ratio of just under 100%. As you've already heard, there was a historically high level of tornado hail activity in the quarter. And as a result, catastrophe losses of 10 points were significantly higher than our expectations. Excluding the impact of cats, the underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations. Weather aside, both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners got off to a good start toward achieving the goals we laid out in the fourth quarter earnings call.", "The Agency Auto combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1%, and consistent with the segment, the cat component was larger than we would normally expect in the first quarter, with catastrophe losses accounting for 2.5 points. The underlying combined ratio came in at 98.6%. Excluding cats, first quarter auto loss experience was in line with our expectations. Compared to the first quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is up 4.6 points. As you can see on Page 18 of the webcast, 3.2 points of the increase was due to the timing of the higher run rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and that Jay mentioned earlier. The remaining 1.5 points was primarily due to the additional impact of tenure, which resulted from the earning-in of the increased levels of new business that we wrote last year. As we explained a couple of quarters ago, while the higher level of new business is creating loss ratio pressure in the short term, we believe it is a good thing for the long-term economic value of the portfolio.", "As we mentioned last quarter, in response to the higher bodily injury loss levels, we're taking actions to improve profitability, and our primary response is to improve the pricing of the book. Renewal premium change ticked up in the quarter to 5.9%, reflecting some of the impact of rate changes that have been approved thus far. As additional rate filings are approved and impact policies at the renewal date, we expect RPC to increase sequentially each quarter, likely approaching double digits in the third quarter. The rate of TIF growth both sequentially and year-over-year, slowed modestly in the quarter. While within the quarter, the monthly rate of growth decelerated, reflecting our efforts to manage growth while profitability improves. As we said last quarter, it will take time for the actions we're implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, but the first quarter results are on track with our expectations.", "Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, we believe the quarter's results once again reinforced the value of providing portfolio solutions. In a quarter when our combined ratio included 19 points of cat losses, more than double our expectation, we still posted a 96.7% combined ratio. The underlying combined of 77.6% was a little more than 1 point higher than the first quarter of 2016, due primarily to higher levels of non-cat weather. Importantly, net written premium and policies in force both grew at an accelerating rate in the quarter despite moderation in the growth rates for Auto. The 4% growth in net written premiums was the strongest result since 2011. We said in recent quarters that it was important for us to maintain focus on generating growth in our Homeowners book, and we feel good about the results so far in 2017. So for the segment as a whole, we're encouraged by our first quarter results.", "Before I turn it over to Gabby, I'd like to comment on a change in the reporting of our segment results going forward. Effective April 1, 2017, the company's results will be reported in 3 business segments: Business Insurance, Bond & Specialty Insurance and Personal Insurance. With this change, the company's international businesses, which were previously reported in total within the Business and International segment, will now be disaggregated amongst these 3 newly aligned business segments. This change doesn't reflect the shift in strategy. Given the progress that we've achieved within our international businesses, we believe that the newly aligned segments will allow us to more effectively engage the product capabilities and talent across both our domestic and international operations.", "With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. We're ready to start the Q&A portion of the call. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed.", "Amit Kumar", "Two questions, the first question is, I guess, going back to the discussion on the Personal Auto book, you talked about the higher underlying loss ratio, which is not a surprise. I'm curious, how should we think about that loss ratio, either stabilizing at the current level or ticking up or down going forward based on the market environment.", "Michael Klein", "This is Michael Klein. So in terms of the underlying, you see the 3.2 points on Page 18. When we talked about that last quarter, we talked about the fact that the full year impact of that in 2016 was about 3.5 points. The fact that 3.2 versus 3.5, there's some quarterly fluctuation in what that number will be quarter to quarter, but underlying coming into the year, we've got a 3.5 point gap that as we talked about last quarter we're working to close. The amount to which that starts to get reduced will, again, as we talked about, sort of earn in over 18 to 24 months as the rate comes through. So there's a couple of things going on there. There's the rate that we're taking that will eventually eat into that 3.5 points, but there's certainly an unfavorable year over year comparison for the first three quarters of this year because we don't have the full 3.5 points recognized till you get to the basis of the full year 2016.", "Amit Kumar", "Okay. The other question I had and this is switching gears on I guess, the broader reserve releases and some other questions we've gotten from investors have obviously focused on the lower level of reserve releases. Bond & Specialty was higher in Q1 2016 due to the AOI experience back in 2016. I'm curious, was that sort of a one off benefit we got in Q1 2016? And hence, we should be careful how we think about reserve releases going forward. Or am I over thinking the meaningful decline in reserve releases this quarter?", "Jay Benet", "Hi. This is Jay Benet. Let me start by saying what we always remind people of. That is, that every quarter, we're looking at, literally, all the reserves, doing lots of analysis and when there's an indication that the reserves needs to change, we make those changes. So we always try to get and always get our best estimate of what those reserves are on a quarter by quarter basis. We've seen things take place in all of the segments that in different quarters have led to mostly favorable development, although we did have a little unfavorable development in Personal Insurance last year. So I don't look at the reserves and try to predict anything in terms of patterns, in terms of intent, in terms of how things are going to emerge. I think of it more as episodic, and that we had large -- larger reserve development in Bond & Specialty last year versus a smaller amount this year. I just look at, that's just what the data said, and we'll see what the data brings in subsequent quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb", "For Personal Auto, I was a little surprised at the persistent high level of policy in force growth at 12%, given the efforts to fix profitability there, can you give us a bit more insight on that?", "Michael Klein", "Sure, Jay. This is Michael Klein. So the one thing I would point out about policy in force growth, particularly if you're looking at that 12% year on year number, is that's really a lagging indicator of growth. So think of the 12% as the 12 month weighted average of the growth we've seen over the last 12 months, right? It's this year's policy in force in the quarter relative to the first quarter of last year. So there's built into that 12% number, primarily is the growth we saw last year. That said, Brian mentioned growth decelerated within the quarter. So what you'll see as you look forward and what we expect is that annual policy in force growth number will come down, but it will come down relatively slowly, again, because of sort of the embedded volume already in the back half of 2016. To Brian's comments about growth decelerating in the quarter, we've seen and you can look at it in the production statistics, a bit of a drop in renewal retention in response to the rate. But also importantly, we're essentially where we expected to be. We continue to see win rates come down as we put rate into the marketplace. And then equally importantly, we talked about at bats last quarter, the efforts we've undertaken to take underwriting action and manage the flow of quote volume into the business have started to take hold, and so where it's actually seeing our quote activity and our win rates come down consistent with expectation and the growth continue to moderate.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, it's Alan. I would just emphasize what Michael said that we were generally able to achieve what we wanted to achieve, and we generally are where we expected to be. So a quarter past, what we talked to you about last quarter, so far so good.", "Jay Gelb", "I appreciate that. And then my follow-up is on the buyback and how the Simply Business acquisition affected that. So in the Q, it says the Simply Business acquisition was total consideration of around $490 million. I thought an acquisition of that size might not have slowed the pace of buybacks in the quarter. And I'm just trying to think about what the implications are for buybacks going forward.", "Jay Benet", "Yes. Jay, this is Jay. The way we manage capital, as you recall, we're preserving capital for organic growth in our business and for any kind of activity that would add to shareholder value over time. So what we looked at here was a relatively modest acquisition, given the size of Travelers. But it does impact the resource space that we have. So in this particular case, what we've decided to do in the first quarter was just hold back a little bit on share repurchases. We know we have an obligation that this thing will close later in the year. We never rely on capital markets being favorable or open or whatever. We take a very conservative look. So all we've done is held back some funds to be able to unequivocally close on the transaction. As we said before, as we get closer to finalizing our financing plans for it, which will be a combination of debt and some of the internal capital, we'll make a final determination as to what the capital level should be, and then return the remaining excess. So I wouldn't look into it as anything other than some cash planning on our part, and no change whatsoever in the whole capital management strategy in the place.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Could you talk about what you're seeing in terms of loss trends in Business Insurance? Do you expect any upward pressure there? I know last quarter, you talked a little bit about how the propensity to litigate in Auto had spread to Small Commercial.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sarah, good morning. It's Alan. I would say, broadly speaking, we haven't seen any significant changes in loss trend in really any of our commercial businesses. And I think you mentioned propensity to litigate. That's not exactly right. What we've seen is a little bit of an increase in attorney representation. And that, actually, we're typically seeing it at smaller less complex cases. So not necessarily increased litigation, just a factor that takes longer to settle the cases and sometimes results in ordering more medical diagnostics, things like that. That's impacting severity. But that's actually not new. We've been seeing that manifest itself on our commercial businesses probably over a couple of years. But I would say, broadly speaking, Sarah, no real change in what's been a pretty favorable loss trend environment. Now in terms of the way we think about that and price and set reserves, we always assume things will return to longer-term normal, but I would say, maybe with the exception of Auto that's been persistently difficult, really no change.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay, great. And then in Business Insurance, you've been taking modest renewal rate increases for the past 2 quarters, but you mentioned it's still below loss trends. What would need to happen for you to take rates to keep up with loss trends?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Well, first of all, we'd have to keep going. And I guess I'd step back, Sarah, and I would say that what we were able to do in the quarter reflects what we were trying to do in the quarter. It was very small, very thoughtful, very subtle shifts, and it's just a reflection of what we thought we needed to do, given what's happened to interest rates and where pricing has been relative to loss trends over a couple of years now. And so we were really encouraged by what we were able to accomplish, and we'll see where that goes in the future. I would point out that we've told you in Business Insurance broadly, loss trends about 4%. Rate would not need to get to 4% in order to be flat because, as we've said before, there's real economic impact from incremental exposure that we're getting. And there's other levers we can pull to improve profitability. And we've talked about those before, terms and conditions, mix, expenses, claims handling, other strategic investments. So all those things add up, Sarah.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed. ", "Kai Pan", "First question to follow up on the Personal Auto side. The 140-basis-point deterioration, it's, if you're excluding the reinstate, reestimates, that's assuming mostly coming from the new business drag or tenure impact. If your TIF growth is gradually slowing down, is that impact will drag on for a little bit longer?", "Michael Klein", "Sure, Kai, this is Michael. Couple of comments and one, just to remind everybody, there is also seasonality in the overall underlying combined ratio in Personal Insurance. So the 98.6% for the first quarter is reflective of, generally speaking, a lower underlying loss ratio in the first quarter than for the balance of the year. So I just wanted to clarify that point. In terms of the 1.5 or so drag from tenure, you're right, that will mitigate over time. But remember that it's not just the new business we've just recently written. It's the cohorts of business we've written over the last couple of years, earning their way through the book. So as we've talked about in the past, the reduction in the tenure impact is something that we measure in years, not quarters. So it will take a while for that to roll off.", "Kai Pan", "Okay, great. My follow-up question is on Simply Business. So Alan, I just wonder, could you explore a little bit about the strategic rationale behind it? And why do you do that in the U.K. rather than do that in the U.S.? And do you expect to expand that platform in the U.S. market, because you have a dominant, kind of like a leading position in Small Business Insurance here?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure, Kai. Good morning. Thanks for the question. We've been thinking about everything changing in the world for a long time. And clearly, one of the things changing most significantly and maybe poised to have the biggest impact on us is the world becoming more digital and more mobile. And so every aspect of our business has to get more digital and more mobile. And so that's the way we engage with our customers, the way we engage with our agents. We've got to be there when and however they want. It's the way we manufacture our products and underwrite our risks. It's the way we market our products. It's the way we manage our internal operations. It's about creating a better experience really for all of our constituencies, internally and externally. We've got to be faster, we've got to be more efficient and we've got to be more flexible.", "So we look around the world, and we think how are we going to develop those capabilities? And we've got two choices: we can develop it internally or we can see who's great at it, and see if we can bring that expertise in-house. And so you scan the world, and we see Simply Business. They've been a hugely successful customer-focused technology company for a dozen years. So it's not a startup. They've been at this a long time, and they've got a real demonstrated success in this. They've got technological capabilities, they've got know-how, a winning approach to innovation, all things that we think that we'll benefit from. And so we were going to develop these capabilities as I said, one way or another, and it turns out that we thought that the best solution for finding those capabilities and bringing them in-house in terms of where they resided, a great cultural fit, and who we actually think the market leader is, it was Simply Business and they happen to be in the UK That fits nicely with us. We've got a business in the UK We've got a very small budding direct Small Commercial business there. Fits nicely. And even before we had started conversations with Simply Business, they had made a decision to bring their model to the United States. So that's even before early stage. I would say that's just getting started. But our ability to help them accelerate that in the U.S., I think was really attractive to them and the capabilities they bring to us is attractive to us. So it started in the UK, and we'll bring it to the U.S. and potentially other geographies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill.", "Paul Newsome", "I'm curious about the change in the International business. Could you -- in one sense, you said that the strategy isn't changing, but it sounds like there is some change going on there, either from a who's in charge kind of position or something else that would drive the segment change. Could you just give us a little bit more color on what actually is changing from a business perspective as opposed to a reporting perspective?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It really is a way -- it's -- this is completely born out of the way that we plan to manage the business and really, it's the opportunity we think we have to leverage our terrific know-how and capabilities in the U.S. to deliver those capabilities outside of the U.S. It's really -- not that that's not significant, but it's nothing more significant than that. It's not a different approach the way we think about the opportunity outside the U.S., it's just a different approach to how we think we can best deliver our capabilities. And we've been on a journey for eight or so years now in trying to invest in and improve our international businesses. We've invested in technology, we've invested in talent, we've -- we're running a better railroad, and we've had a lot of success. And so the leadership that's brought us there will continue to be actively involved in managing those businesses as a portfolio. We'll have an ongoing obligation to manage those companies on a standalone basis, because we've got regulated entities in the various countries, and we'll continue to do that with the great leadership that has always done that. But we've got an opportunity with the talent and the capabilities in the U.S. to just do a better job of leveraging that outside of the U.S.", "Jon Newsome", "But there's nobody is there an actually a change in who reports to who or anything like that in those segments?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Well, it's -- we've always had a matrix reporting structure, and we'll continue to have a matrix reporting structure of the international business and our the people that run the countries will continue to report to Kevin Smith, and he'll have responsibility for that. But beneath that organizational alignment, we'll look at Greg Toczydlowski for Business Insurance and Tom Kunkel for Bond & Specialty and Michael Klein for Personal Insurance, and they will, on a matrix basis, manage their product delivery outside the United States. It's not it's actually not that different than the way we've thought about it all along. It's just an opportunity to reinforce the engagement on a product level.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.", "Randy Binner", "I had a follow up to Amit's question earlier. And the question is, how are actual severity trends developing relative to the assumption you made, call it, late last year? And if there's commentary on frequency as well, this is in Auto, of course. I'm just wondering, yes, I know that you are re-pricing against elevated trend, but anecdotally, we all observe, I think kind of continued challenges in auto accident frequency and severity. So the question is, how is the actual loss environment developing relative to that re-pricing assumption that started late last year?", "Michael Klein", "Yes. So Randy, it's Michael. The actual development is consistent with the re-pricing assumptions, whether that's the 3.5 points of elevated bodily injury losses that are now in the underlying or whether it's the elevated level of loss trend that we talked to you about in the fourth quarter that we added to our pricing. So as we sit here today, the experience in the first quarter of 2017 developed consistent with those expectations. The only thing I just want to add a point back to the question from Kai, and I think it was implied in my answer, but the 1.5 of tenure impact that we're talking about year on year is year on year, and therefore, that's not the full amount of tenure impact, right? There's -- there was tenure impact in the base in 2016, the 1.5 point is an additional 1.5 point on top of that, just to clarify. But to your question, the experience thus far this year has been consistent with both the elevated starting point and the elevated trend that we factored into our expectations.", "Randy Binner", "Okay, great. And then, I guess, the follow up there is understanding that and understanding the price that you're moving, you're putting into the market. Do you see Travelers as an auto insurance company that's going to gain market share because of the dislocation out there with some of the mutual's really having to push very high pricing? Or do you see yourself kind of in the middle or potentially losing market share as we see market share dislocation in U.S. auto insurance?", "Michael Klein", "Sure. So just a couple of points. First of all, in 2016, we gained share ever so slightly, 0.1 point based on the growth that we experienced last year. Certainly, coming into this quarter, you see the TIF growth at 12%, you see the period to period TIF growth at 2%. We would view in the first quarter, our growth probably outpacing the market. That said, our objective is to improve profitability and manage growth. So our the glide path we're trying to move the business down is one to reduce the growth rate but continue to grow as we manage profitability. What that amounts to in terms of market share really depends on what happens with the other players in the marketplace. We would tell you that the pricing actions that we're putting into market, again, consistent with our view of the loss trends being environmental, we're not alone in terms of driving rate. But what that ultimately amounts to in terms of share, we'll have to wait and see.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And Randy, we don't really manage to market share, we manage to returns, profitability, balancing that with growth, and market share will fall out of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo.", "Elyse Greenspan", "First question, I was hoping to get some additional color on your outlook for the Business Insurance pricing environment. In the Q, you guys point to the renewal premium change basically being consistent with the Q1 for the balance of the year. So I mean, how do you view kind of pricing compared to expectations or any changes in the U.S. economy when you came to that outlook for the RPC?", "Alan Schnitzer", "So Elyse, RPC obviously includes rate and exposure. And so it's a broader measure, and there's obviously a corridor around the words \"broadly consistent.\" And so we're probably not going to break that down into pure rate and exposure. Obviously, we thought we needed to get more pure rate in the first quarter. And as I said, we were encouraged, we were able to do that. I will say that the trends that lead us to do that, namely a lower interest rate environment and where rate has been for a while relative to loss trends, those trends still persist out there, and so we'll have to take that into account. And so we'll take it from there. Obviously, we operate in a competitive marketplace, and so that will be a factor. So we're encouraged and then we'll see where it goes.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, thank you. And then just a couple of numbers question and going back to the Personal Auto book. If I look at your underlying loss ratio this Q1 compared to the adjusted last year, it seems like there's about 2.5 points of deterioration. You guys said year-over-year the delta was about 1.5 points that changed from tenure. So what else am I missing when I look at that calculation, since it's adjusted with the elevated trends last Q1? And a second-part question in terms of the auto margins, your expense ratio in the Personal Auto book came down in the fourth quarter, and then also with that, that kind of lower level this quarter. How do you think about the expense ratio for the Auto book when you think about your margin outlook for that business for the balance of 2017?", "Michael Klein", "Yes. So Elyse, it's Michael, to your point I'll start with expense ratio. We continue to manage expenses on a pretty disciplined basis inside PI, and we're enjoying the benefit of the increased volume over relatively flat expense base. And that continues to be our plan going forward. In terms of the other components of loss ratio, it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation. There's nothing -- there's some puts and takes underneath that, but it's really normal period-to-period fluctuation has explained those other changes in the underlying.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Ryan Tunis", "I guess my first one was just a follow up on Alan's comments about -- in Domestic, the positive rate indication this quarter on 59% of the book versus 53% a year ago. And I guess, just thinking a little bit more granularly, what is leading to the upward rate indication? Is there pressure on certain accounts? Or is it, I think the point you made just several years of rate running below loss cost trend?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, good morning, Ryan. So we manage the business on a very granular level with a return objective in mind. And we had a bunch of years going back to 2010 or '11, where we had a rising rate environment and that put us in a very good position in terms of where our earned and written returns were. And since, I don't know, beginning of 2014 or so, we've been in an environment where rate's been below loss trend, and we've had low, continued low interest rate environment. I think the 10-year this morning was slightly over 2.2% or something like that. And so over time those things have an impact.", "And while today, we're satisfied with our [written] returns, we look out the windshield into the future and see where things are going, and it causes us to, again, very selectively, very thoughtfully in a way that we think makes sense, given our portfolio, our returns, working with our distribution partners in a way that's never intended to be disruptive to them or our customers. We try to improve the return outlook. And not everywhere, I made the point, in our Select business was in a different position from our return perspective. And we were happy to take the rate where it was, where it's been over recent quarters, and so it's just very granular execution with the return objective in mind.", "Ryan Tunis", "That's helpful. And then, I guess, just following up on the line of questioning in Auto. I guess thinking about weather in Q1, it seemed like January, February, weather was somewhat benign. You had warmer temperatures. I'm wondering if, how you characterize the impact of weather on Auto in 1Q in the first quarter. I think the way to ask it is, how did frequency trend year-over-year?", "Michael Klein", "Yes, again, I would say, broadly speaking, frequency and severity in the first quarter came in consistent with our expectation. I think, we talk about the impact of the weather, and we'll talk about warm temperatures, above freezing in cold months, can give you sometimes higher speeds and higher severity. Cold temperatures below freezing will give you ice and will give you more high frequency, low severity bumping into things. But you see those period-to-period fluctuations, and again, that's part of my point in the response to Elyse, is we got just normal period-to-period fluctuations, but we didn't see anything in the first quarter significantly different than our expectations.", "Brian MacLean", "Well, and specifically, this is Brian. When you think of the first quarter cat activity, it's the tornado hail and specifically the hail that is driving the numbers. And that is usually the case. So especially in Auto, hail will bring about an immediate uptick. And that's what we saw in March, as Alan pointed out.", "Ryan Tunis", "Got it. So maybe over March, weather normalized some. Okay.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of a Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed. ", "Lawrence Greenberg", "Just staying on Auto, are you seeing anything new in how you think about the long-term value of the business that you put on in the last couple of few years, probably undeniable that you'd, like to have repriced some of that a little bit earlier. But are you seeing anything new that would support or refute that this is business that you ultimately want and will be value enhancing over the long term?", "Brian MacLean", "No, Larry, we're not. I mean, as we've talked about over the past several quarters, we're slicing and dicing it 18 ways to Sunday. But from a quality perspective, the quality of the business, the profile of the business is very consistent with what we targeted when we designed and developed and launched the Quantum Auto 2.0 product. Again, the profile of the business coming in doors is consistent with what we've been looking for. We continue to evaluate and examine that tenure impact and make sure that the business is tenuring consistent with our expectations.", "And so to your point from a long-term economic value perspective, it's tracking with our expectations. Again, we would have liked to have charged more for it, but that is really the primary conclusion. And that's why the strategy to improve the profitability is to go after it with base rate.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And to the extent that we do keep it and improve profitability from an economic perspective, it'll be a good thing in terms of creating economic value.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith", "A couple of quick questions here. First, Brian, Alan, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics right now in the Workers' Compensation insurance area? The premiums are down a little bit the last couple of quarters. And are you seeing any impact in the marketplace from, perhaps a competitor having some issues?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. So thanks, Brian. And I always preface our comments with we feel great about our Workers' Comp capabilities. We clearly feel we're the industry leader. We've got, between our underwritten book and our service book, the largest portfolio in the industry. So we know the line well. We know the difficulty there can be with any long-tail line and more than any business we have, incredibly granular, industry-by-industry, state-by-state, account-size-by-account-size. So we look at that a lot. Yes, pricing is -- so directionally, there is definitely good news on the loss trend side, now it's a very long tail line of business. So short-term movements in loss trend get blended in as we look at long-tail loss trend.", "But loss trends have been positive, but pricing is reacting and probably overreacting to that in the marketplace. So we're looking at it very closely. There has been some disruption with carriers out there in the market, and we are looking at that business closely. It's still got to meet the economic hurdles that we have in the profitability, so to the extent that there are opportunities out there that we think we can write at appropriately prices, and we're excited about it. But we'll look into that closely.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay. Great. And then, next question, I'm just curious in the Management Liability area. What are you seeing with loss trends there?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Nothing significant. There's been a lot written about securities class actions being up and the numbers may be up. I would say as it relates to us, we've got a very diversified Management Liability book. We manage positions in the tower and limits very carefully. And the activity that we've seen that's been at elevated levels is in industries where we're under-weighted. It's been biotech, pharma, health care, and we're under-weighted there.", "I'd also add that as you look at that commentary out there that suggests that numbers of security class actions are up, sometimes the methodology in counting the cases distorts the numbers. You've got to look at cases that were previously brought in state court that are now being brought in federal court for reasons you'd have to ask a plaintiff's bar about, but you really have to look at the aggregate of those two numbers to see the trends in claim counts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of a Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen", "Most of my questions have been answered. But just one question. When you look at the difference in the renewal rate change versus the renewal premium change, that difference is much bigger in Select than it is for the broader Commercial or Business Insurance segment. And I'm wondering why that is. Why is there a bigger difference in Select?", "Gregory Toczydlowski", "Hey, Jay, this is Greg Toczydlowski. In the Select business, just given the smaller nature of those policies, we have a certain segment of the business that we call Express business and the CMP or the BOP portion has some inflationary guards inside there. So that's automatically applied, typically to the property line, so underneath the CMP or the BOP product. So that's one of the drivers. The other one is around Workers' Comp. Workers' Comp, we continue to see the type of mix that we're writing, some wage increases and some increases in payroll. So the combination of the two has really given us that exposure lift that we're getting in that business.", "Jay Cohen", "And Workers' Comp then is a bigger piece of the Select business than it is of the overall segments business?", "Gregory Toczydlowski", "Is the question as a percentage of the overall premium? It's got a similar mix profile, if that's the question.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Meyer Shields", "Very briefly, when you talk about reallocating the international business to the individual segments, can you talk broadly about what impact that would have on the reported underlying combined ratios?", "Brian MacLean", "Just procedurally, one of the things we're in the process of doing is reconstituting the 10-K information as well as the supplement. So just in line with your question, we'll be providing this kind of data to you in advance of the webcast for the second quarter. We expect late in the second quarter to get the information out into the public. But I think when you look at the overall size of the various segments versus the size of the international operations, I think the impact on the combined ratios will generally be pretty modest.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And just to state the obvious, when you look at the consolidated number for prior periods, there will be no change, right? It'll be modest reallocation among the segments, but relatively small impact.", "Meyer Shields", "Right. No, that makes sense. And then, the Simply Business acquisition, where are we going to see those earnings in the segments and then in the income statement?", "Jay Benet", "Simply Business, will be part we expect it to be part of the Business Insurance segment. So it'll be there, but we'll see how we'll present that. I mean, it'll be part of the segment, it'll be wrapped in. But again, and just in terms of the size of the Business Insurance segment, Simply Business will be a pretty small piece of that.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Excellent. That concludes our call for today. Thank you very much for joining.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

And welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 21, 2015.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2015 results.", "Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.", "Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to start 2015 by reporting another strong quarter with operating income of $827 million or $2.53 per share and an operating return on equity of 14.5%. Our underwriting results remained very strong across all of our business units as evidenced by our combined ratio of 88.9%.", "Additionally, we achieved a record level of retention in domestic business insurance while simultaneously posting positive renewal rate change. With Quantum Auto 2.0 in full rollout, in Agency Auto, we achieved policy in force growth of 1.8%. The first-time that metric has been positive since 2011. We posted these results notwithstanding another severe winter and the reduction in net investment income from last year\u2019s first quarter.", "Jay will speak about our investment income in just a moment but for now suffice it to say that nothing happened that we had not contemplated or considered a possibility. The operating and production results for this quarter were being very encouraging and consistent with our belief that the amplitude of the historical cycle has narrowed. Importantly, this stability contributes to our confidence and our ability to continue to deliver superior returns on equity.", "The confidence that we have is in part evidenced by our capital management strategies. Today our Board of Directors announced an 11% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.61 per share, marking the 11th consecutive year of dividend increases and bringing the compound annual growth rate on the dividend to nearly 10% over this time. In addition, we returned $850 million from capital to shareholders, bringing our total since 2006 to $31.6 billion. And we\u2019ve done all of that while continuing to make significant investments in our business and our people. Canada, Brazil and the data center in Omaha just to name a few.", "Rightsizing capital and reinvesting in the business are not mutually exclusive, both are fundamental to the way we think about the business for the long-term. We intend to continue with these strategies and in that regard, our Board also authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.", "We\u2019ve made substantial progress in improving our product returns over the past five years through a thoughtful, focused and highly analytical approach to our business that has been well executed in the marketplace. We intend to continue on this path. In that regard, fixed income returns remain at historical lows and as a consequence, we must continue to be mindful that this challenging environment has already lasted far longer than most would have assumed and we will continue to factor that environment into our pricing strategies.", "In addition, we note that weather patterns do seem to be different. This change when combined with increased real-estate development, causes us to be very attentive to incorporating the real cost of weather uncertainty in our business. Part of the answer to this challenge above and beyond price and policy terms is helping our customers consider their risks and protect their assets in the most thoughtful ways possible. And we know that we and our independent agents are committed to helping customers do just that. As the world gets riskier, the value of thoughtful insurance advice goes up.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. We are pleased with our first quarter results. Operating income of $827 million and operating return on equity of 14.5%, despite operating income being down $225 million from the very strong first quarter we had in 2014. Importantly, this decrease in operating income was not driven by deteriorating the underwriting results.", "As Jay just said, we reported a consolidated combined ratio of 88.9% this quarter. Rather the decrease in operating income primarily resulted from three items: Net investment income that was lower by a $104 million after tax; the inclusion in last year\u2019s first quarter of a $49 million after tax benefit from a change in state law that led to a reduction in our estimated liability for state assessments for workers\u2019 compensation premiums; and while still at high level, net favorable prior-year reserve development that was lower by $32 million after tax.", "Net investment income this quarter is being compared to a very strong first quarter last year and both fixed and non-fixed income returns were lower than the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income NII was lower principally due to private equity returns, which was slightly positive this quarter, as compared to a very strong first quarter last year. Energy related private equity funds produced negative NII of $21 million after tax, giving up a small fraction of what has previously been earned in these funds in recent years. While we cannot predict future oil prices and even though, we report private equity returns on a three months lag, a number of factors suggest that the vast majority of the impact of the recent decline in oil prices has been reflected in the current quarter\u2019s results.", "Current oil prices are slightly higher than at the yearend, share prices of public companies and our funds portfolios are also higher than they were at yearend and nothing we\u2019ve seen has reduced our confidence in the general partners of our portfolio funds. Additionally for non-energy related private equity funds, which represent approximately 85% of our private equity portfolio, returns were adequate this quarter, although far below what was an unusually good first quarter in 2014.", "Fixed income NII was lower principally due to what we\u2019ve been saying from many years now. Securities having higher book yields ran off during the past 12 months and were replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current interest rate environment. Another contributing factor was the level of short-term investments which yield very little, being somewhat higher this quarter than in the prior year quarter.", "Each of our business segments once again contributed to our net favorable prior year development, which totaled $243 million on a pretax basis. In business and international insurance, net favorable development of $77 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in the general liability product line for accident years 2005 and prior along with better expected loss experience in workers\u2019 comp for accident years 2007 and prior.", "In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $35 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in contract surety for accident years 2010 through 2012. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $131 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in recent accident years for home owners and auto liability coverages as well as better than expected loss experience in home owners for recent cat and non-cat weather related losses. On a combined state basis for all of our U.S. subs, there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter.", "Operating cash flows of $199 million compared to $703 million in the prior year quarter, a $504 million decrease entirely due to the $579 million payment we made this quarter in final settlement of the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. As this amount was fully accrued at the beginning of the quarter, this payment had no impact on the quarter\u2019s operating income or share repurchases and it will have no impact on future share repurchases.", "Holding company liquidity was over $1.7 billion at the end of the quarter and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized invest gains were approximately $3.2 billion pretax or $2.1 billion after tax, up from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year and book value per share was $77.96 or 1% higher than at the beginning of the year. I\u2019d point out that book value per share growth was achieved despite the negative impact of the strengthening of the dollar on foreign currency translations.", "Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $850 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of a $178 million and repurchased $672 million of our common shares this quarter including $600 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and $72 million to primarily -- to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon investing and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Jay said, the Board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.55 to $0.61 per share and added an additional $5 billion for share repurchases.", "So with all that, let me now turn the mic over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thank you, Jay. Alan and Doreen will go over the individual segment results in a moment, but before they do I want to make a few comments on the impact of weather and the operating environment in the domestic commercial market price.", "Regarding the weather, patterns continue to be unpredictable and that was clearly evidenced by another challenging quarter. Weather losses in the first quarter of 2015 were slightly higher than the first quarter of 2014, but more importantly in both years we experienced losses above our expectations, driven by the polar vortex last year and the extreme snowing cold in the northeast in 2015. Much has been written about the snowfall in Boston this year, which at over 110 inches was a record for the season. But the real story is that nearly 95 inches of this snowfall came in just a 30-day period. To show just how unusual that was the Washington Post cited a meteorologist who calculated that Boston should not expect to see another 30 days with that much snow for another \u201capproximately 26,315 years.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not sure what they meant by approximately but suffice it to say was an extremely unusual event.", "As we think about the continuing unpredictability of weather patterns and our exposure to catastrophic weather losses, our expectations for cat losses are significantly higher today than they were just six or seven years ago. And importantly, historically we would have expected to have been below budget absent a fairly significant Atlantic storm. Unfortunately it has now become all too common for us to have significant cat losses from what we traditionally thought were the lower severity frequency events like tornado, hail and winter storms. So weather patterns are changing and accordingly we\u2019re continuing to reassess and manage our property exposure and pricing in a thoughtful way.", "Regarding the domestic commercial pricing environment, we feel very good about the returns we are seeing in this business and we are encouraged by the continued stability of the market. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we embarked on a strategy to improve the returns and profitability of our commercial business by increasing rate, improving terms and conditions, and focusing risk selection. We said that we would execute on this strategy thoughtfully and in a manner that would not be disruptive to the marketplace.", "Accordingly, our initial goal was to achieve gradual rate increases, eventually reaching a level that would drive significant improvement on the returns of our products over time. And once our returns had reached the appropriate levels, we hope to see rate moderate at a level that would allow us to sustain reasonable returns. Looking back, this is almost exactly what we have seen over the last four and half years. And we couldn\u2019t be more pleased not just in the results but in how we have achieved them. We couldn\u2019t have scripted it better.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Alan.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Brian. Good morning. I feel very good about our performance in business and international insurance this quarter. Operating results were strong and importantly, we were encouraged by the continued stability in the U.S. marketplace as reflected in the facts that our retention is at a record level and we\u2019re still achieving renewal rate gains. As Brian said, we could not have scripted this better.", "The underlying combined ratio was 92.7%, an increase of 3.2 points over the prior year quarter. Eliminating the benefit from the state workers\u2019 compensation assessment in last year\u2019s first quarter, the underlying combined ratio increased by about 1 point, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuation. Particularly in light of the severe winter weather that Brian mentioned, we feel great about the underlying profitability.", "Turning to the top line, net written premiums were up about 1% from the prior year quarter with the timing and structure of a number of reinsurance treaties and changes in foreign exchange rates having an adverse impact. Domestic net written premiums were up about 2% but adjusting for the timing impact of the reinsurance treaties, premiums were almost 3.5%.", "In our international business, net written premiums were down 7%, driven by the adverse impact of foreign exchange. The production results this quarter in our domestic business continue to be very encouraging. As we\u2019ve said in the last few quarters, more of our business is achieving target returns. And our objective has been to keep more of that business to our very granular account by account and class by class execution. Record retention this quarter, speaks to the success of that strategy.", "Renewal premium change was down about 1 point from the fourth quarter of last year and within that, pure renewal rate change was also down about 1 point. Notably, renewal rate change across most of our businesses has been steady for each of the three months within the current quarter.", "Turning to select, retention had a full year high and renewal premium change was strong at 7.3%. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the returns in this business and we\u2019ll continue to seek high retentions and higher levels of new business. In middle market, retention was a very strong 87% with over 90% retention on our best performing segments. Renewal rate change moderated less than 1 point in the fourth quarter to 1.1%. In terms of new business, we\u2019re very pleased with the results in middle market this quarter.", "As you\u2019ve heard from us, the impact of rate gains over the past four years has resulted in more new business opportunities that met our return threshold. The amount of new business we wrote in the quarter was impacted by the high volume of new business activity in the marketplace. January is a big month for new business submissions. Also it\u2019s worth noting that prior year quarter was particularly low from a new business standpoint. So that obviously contributes to the quarter-over-quarter increase. Our international business also posted solid production results.", "Over the past several quarters, renewal premium change has been steady and retention is trended up. In the current quarter, new business levels were lower than we would have liked, largely reflecting our disciplined response to conditions in the Lloyd\u2019s marketplace.", "I\u2019m pleased to note that as we announced last week, we agree to increase our stake in the P&C business with our Brazilian joint venture to 95%, up from 49.5%. We will maintain our 49.5% stake in the JV surety business. Our P&C business in Brazil is small. We launched it in 2012 and wrote about $20 million of net written premium last year but we continue to see long term growth opportunities. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.", "To sum it up, we feel great about the quarter. We\u2019re focused on maintaining attractive returns and we\u2019re well positioned to execute where we find opportunities.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Thank you, Alan and good morning everybody.", "Bond and specialty insurance started 2015 with a strong first quarter and we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was a $124 million, a reduction from the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development and lower net investment income. Underlying underwriting results remained very strong and well within our target.", "As for top-line, net written premium for the quarter was essentially flat to 2014 for both on management liability and surety businesses. Across our management liability businesses, retention and new business premium were both slightly improved from recent quarters while RPC levels remained broadly consistent. In sum, not a lot of movement in the quarter to highlight for you and we continue to feel great about this segment\u2019s result.", "I\u2019ll turn now to personal insurance, where we also had a terrific first quarter with strong underwriting results in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Operating income for the quarter was $252 million, down slightly from the first quarter of 2014 due primarily to lower net investment income. The underlying combined ratio was essentially flat to the prior year and had a level that we feel great about for the segment.", "Looking at Agency Auto, we once again delivered strong top-line and bottom-line results for the quarter and continued to be very pleased with the performance of this business. The 90.2% combined ratio for the quarter benefited from approximately 3 points of favorable prior year reserve development which was driven by better than expected severity in bodily injury. The underlying combined ratio of 93% was a slight improvement from an already strong 2014, and in a range we\u2019re comfortable with.", "Production results also continued to be strong driven by Quantum Auto 2.0; new business premium was 67% higher than the first quarter of 2014; and we continued to grow our policies in force which increased 21,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 4% from the prior quarter. So by all measures, great results for Auto for the quarter.", "Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we once again delivered strong financial results and we\u2019re making progress in production as we execute local product and pricing strategy. The overall combined ratio of 74.4% was strong and benefited from favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 79.5% is also well within our return expectations for the quarter. So, financial results remain strong as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.", "As for Agency Homeowners production, we said earlier that we continue to make progress. New business premium was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and continues to trend favorably. We feel great about our market leading Homeowners\u2019 capability and know this product is a critical component of the customer package.", "Brian discussed the continued impact of weather. With these considerations in mind and our strong financial results in this line, we remain focused on improving our offering, both product features and process improvements to be again growing this business again. Based upon the new business trends we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re encouraged with our path.", "Lastly on Agency Homeowners & Other, net written premium was down 5%, primarily driven by the impact of changes in the timing and structure of certain of the company\u2019s reinsurance treaties. So to sum up, personal insurance had excellent results and a great start to 2015.", "And with that, I will turn the call back to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Doreen. We are now ready for Q&A. And I would like to remind the participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Go ahead.", "Randy Binner", "Two part question on reserves, especially in the commercial area. I saw the comments that you took some CGL in 2005 and prior and work comp in 2007 and prior but one, was wondering about more recent years in work comp and casualty lines, if those need to season more? And two if you could provide your initial take on the 2012 and 2013 accident years and the question there is given that you are about 36 months out from there and we had a mini hard market in pricing in those years and I think evidence of lost cost trends remaining benign, wondering how the 2012 and 2013 years are looking now that you can have a better view on that?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I\u2019ll try to wrap in some comments about all of that and some overview set. So, as it relates to the reserve development, these years do have to season a bit for us to get a good look on what the longer tail liabilities are doing. However, having said that, as you know, we have a very robust and granular process for looking at our reserves. So, we look at them every quarter. And if there are things that are developing either currently or from prior years that would have a rollover effect, which we call base year movement, into the current years will reflect that as appropriate.", "So looking at the more seasoned years at this point in time, we did take action to reduce reserves, as you pointed out in general liability and workers\u2019 comp for 2007, 2005 and prior, as we disclosed. None of that really had a major impact on the more current years. The current years haven\u2019t developed in any meaningful, way one way or the other at this point in time in the current quarter. There have been actions in previous quarters, some of the more recent accident years where we\u2019ve made some minor adjustments. But at this stage, as I had indicated earlier, there really was no meaningful unfavorable development taking place in any of our products, any of our accident years. And on the favorable side, we\u2019ve pointed out in a press release what that was.", "Randy Binner", "And I guess the follow-up would be just kind of honing in on 2012 and 2013 and understanding they are not fully developed, but there is some amount of time that\u2019s passed. I mean given the pricing that was better then, do you have evidence that loss costs trends remained benign in that period of time or was there an elevation in loss cost trends in those years in particular. I guess from what we\u2019re seeing it seems like most loss cost trends for casualty have been incredibly benign, especially in those years.", "Jay Benet", "As we\u2019ve said in previous calls, we\u2019re not seeing anything as it relates to loss cost trends that\u2019s surprising to us or different from what our assumptions are. These are of course very long liabilities. So, you are going to react in a prudent way to any changing information that you see. And as it relates to this whole thing, which we\u2019re referring to as benign or whatever, everything is really dependent upon what your reserving assumptions. and as long as your reserving assumptions are based on what\u2019s taking place in the marketplace, you are not making adjustments for things, which is not to say over time, you wouldn\u2019t look further at the data and see things that would cause you to recognize favorable development or God forbid, unfavorable development. But at this stage, our reserves, as we always do are best estimates of what we see today and we\u2019ll just see how they develop going forward.", "Jay Fishman", "And it\u2019s Jay Fishman. Just let me add one point. Couple of times in your question, you referenced pricing and its impact on reserve. And we just don\u2019t -- pricing is not a factor as we set up reserves for our business. Our reserves are driven by costs. And the pricing what we sell it for is driven by the marketplace. And so the notion that our reserves are sit differently in a different pricing environment is just wrong; it\u2019s just not correct.", "So, what Jay I think is -- so far so good. So, far the estimates that we established in the years of which Jay referenced are continuing to stand up to whatever the developing trends are.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "First question is on the margin and like classify the one point movements in terms of business margin deterioration as a quarterly fluctuation. So, just wonder has that one point impact by some non-cat large weather related losses and also going forward, if you see your pricing continue to accelerate, are we going to expect some continued margin expansion -- margin deterioration?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Hi. It\u2019s Alan Schnitzer, let me take that. So, the one point that we characterized is typical fluctuations, maybe be rising from two components, one in the loss side. There is some fungibility of losses and we\u2019re talking about a relatively small numbers. So, it\u2019s hard to sort of necessarily pin point what those dollars were. But as we look at our analytics and our losses, what we really saw in the quarter was a very small, you can count them on one hand, a small number of large fires around the world; they contributed to after tax less than $20 million that maybe where that comes from. The rest of it was on the expense side and there is always going to be some normal fluctuations in expenses from period-to-period.", "In terms of the margin outlook, you could certainly look what rate is doing and what loss trend is doing and do a very narrow quantitative analysis and say Gee! Margins are going to shrink. We try to look at margins on a broader basis. So, lots of things other than the written rate and estimated loss trend that are going to impact margins going forward. You\u2019ve got things like volume exposure; mix; expenses; claim initiatives; weather large losses, all those things every quarter are going to have an impact on our results. And so, at least the away we look at written rate and loss trend at the moment, hard for us to say necessarily what margins going to do over the near-term. And we take our best shot in giving you some perspective on that in the outlook section of the 10-Q. So, I would suggest that if you haven\u2019t had a chance to look at that.", "Jay Fishman", "This is Jay Fishman. One other observation, your question and Alan\u2019s answer is in respect of written rate versus loss trend. Obviously on an earned basis, as we look forward to the rest of this year, looking over to Jay Benet to see from right, we anticipate that earned margin will continue to modestly expand from here, all other things being the same and they never are. So, I\u2019m simply talking about the calculation of earned rate versus loss trend modestly; everybody\u2019s pointing modestly here. So, it\u2019s not a matter of this year. I second the motion on Alan\u2019s comment, which is one is obviously the lower number than four and all other things being the same that would suggest some margin compression. But again, all other things are not the same, exposure, a meaningful portion of exposure; acts like rate; you get volume differences, you get productivity efficiencies. So, it\u2019s close. And I would hesitate on concluding definitively that return margins and therefore some time down the future earned margins at this level will by definition reduce, they may, possible but it\u2019s not -- it just isn\u2019t that clear yet, the numbers are just not -- that point is different.", "Kai Pan", "I have follow up on the reserve side. If you look at short tail of line releases over the past two years that account for a majority of the reserve releases, having in two years. I just wonder in hindsight because shorter line, you would imagine probably little bit easier to reserve than the long tail lines and what has helped you guys in the past two years in terms of short line reserve releases and the sustainability of that going forward?", "Alan Schnitzer", "We can\u2019t talk about the sustainability of it, because going back to our reserving philosophy, we\u2019re always reserving at best estimate. So, we feel like we talk about some of the things that have caused the reserves to develop favorably. You say that short tail lines are easier to reserve for and it\u2019s an interesting phenomenon that takes place. If you are dealing with short tail and particularly if you\u2019re dealing with property, you have events that take place; in many cases, they\u2019re taking place in a current quarter where you\u2019re coming up with the estimates in that quarter. And even though it\u2019s a short tail business, you\u2019re dealing with not a lot of claim information at that particular time. So, you\u2019re looking at recent activity or historical activity to make judgments as to how those claims are going to develop; how the storms are going to develop.", "And depending upon the nature of the storm, where the storm hits, you could have situations where you are thinking that a tornado has a lot of hail associated with it; you look at the history of how that\u2019s developed and put up numbers and then as time goes on, we found that we overshot the mark a little bit because that particular storm didn\u2019t follow the pattern of previous storms in terms of the related hail damage. So, it\u2019s like everything else in reserving; you have some data upon which to make assumptions and then you extrapolate from that; you make your best estimate and then you\u2019re always adjusting it. And in the case of short tail, it conveys the higher fluctuations. What I really mean by that is the period of time in which you find, you\u2019re making the adjustments is a relatively short period of time; it\u2019s correcting quickly whereas in lines GL or workers\u2019 company, you can often that you\u2019re seeing long-term trends and you\u2019re evaluating them but the period of time in which you\u2019re making the adjustments can often times be over several quarters or even several years, it\u2019s just data getting more solid. So, it\u2019s an interesting aspect of reserving that I found intriguing when I first got involved in it. But as it relates to the short tail lines, you do see these fluctuations because you\u2019re dealing sometimes with very, very little data.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar", "Just two quick questions; the first question is for Doreen. The results in Auto were strong. Can you sort of expand on the loss costs comment? I think previously you\u2019ve mentioned that loss trends have remained at around 3%; is it fairly unchanged in terms of where we are in the quarter?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Yes, it is. We debated about whether to put that in and you\u2019d ask us about it anyway. So, yes, we do see the severity trends for Auto to be about 3% and that\u2019s all in. I guess -- I\u2019m just trying to think; and that includes bodily injury as well. That\u2019s a little bit higher but when you blend everything, it\u2019s about 3%.", "Amit Kumar", "And sort of switching gears, this might be for -- this is a question on the surety piece. There have been recent press reports mentioning Malucelli and Petrobras; would it be possible to maybe talk about any go forward potential surety exposure you might have to this piece?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s way too early for us to really have any assessment on the impact on us from a surety perspective. This is just starting to unfold. What I will say is that we\u2019ve great confidence in our people down there; we\u2019ve got great confidence in our underwriting; we manage our gross and net exposures pretty carefully; and together with our partner and our local team, we continue to watch it. We don\u2019t have any reason at the moment to think that this is an outsized problem for us but I will reiterate that it\u2019s early and we\u2019re watching it.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "The only thing I was going to add is that we remain very proud to be committed with J. Malucelli as a partner and they are one of those finest companies in Brazil. So with all of the discipline they bring and we bring, it\u2019s an unfortunate set of events but we feel like we\u2019re in the best position that we can be with that partner.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Go ahead.", "Jay Gelb", "Firstly, I just had a question on the buyback. The $5 billion authorization, do you anticipate that taking roughly two years to complete?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay, Jay. We\u2019re not predicting what it is. I mean we talk about our share repurchases as being driven by our earnings. So, depending upon what you and others feel, our earnings look like going forward, you can do the math as to how long you think that share repurchase authorization will be out there for our utilization. And of course that\u2019s in addition to the remainder of the previous authorization which I think was another 80, 84 [ph]. So, I think looking at what your projections are and looking at the utilization in the past, you can come up with pretty good estimate of what you think it will be.", "Jay Gelb", "And then my follow-up question is on investment income. Given the drop off in the other investment income and in the first quarter of fixed income, investment income typically being seasonally highest in the first quarter, if I put that together, it looks like you could see at least a 10% decline in investment income after tax in 2015, maybe into the low-teens. Is my math okay?", "Jay Benet", "I think there is two pieces to that, one, looking at the fixed investments, we\u2019ve put some disclosure in our Q as to what we thought the period-over-period decrease on a quarterly basis would be for fixed income NII. And of course, the drivers of that are two-fold. One, the lower interest rate environment, as items mature either in the current quarter or really in the previous nine quarters as well, they are getting reinvested at the lower rate. So that will have an impact. And also as we pointed out, we paid the $579 million on the direct action, so those funds are no longer in the investment portfolio. And when you combine those two things, you\u2019re roughly at about a $30 million after-tax decrease on the fixed income NII.", "As it relates to the non-fixed income portion, we\u2019ve provided you data on what the composition of the portfolio is. You\u2019ve seen the historical yields associated with it. I don\u2019t have a crystal ball to say how the economy is going to perform and whatever. We\u2019ve tried to give information as it relates to the impact of the oil price decline and the feeling like we\u2019ve hopefully gotten to a point whether vast majority of whatever re-pricing or revaluations will take place have been captured. But I think you need to make your own estimates as to what you think that part of the portfolio will be.", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s Jay Fishman. I will give it to Bill Heyman in a second, just two points. I am not clear what your comment about seasonality in net investment income, is that\u2026?", "Jay Gelb", "On the fixed income, investment income for the year, seasonally it is highest in the first quarter?", "Jay Fishman", "No, it\u2019s seasonally -- it declines; these are just bond. Don\u2019t interpret that seasonality one there, [ph] it\u2019s just yield; that\u2019s all it is; it\u2019s the same bonds...", "Jay Gelb", "If I look at first quarter every year, it seems like the first quarter is the highest and then it shows off and\u2026", "Jay Fishman", "There is nothing about the fixed income -- our fixed income portfolio that has any seasonality to it whatsoever. Other than as time progresses and more of the portfolio is reinvested at lower rates, we\u2019ve been saying it for years now, the net investment income will go down over time. No seasonality in that number at all. As it relates to the energy dynamic, I would point out that we put out a schedule in last quarter\u2019s webcast which summarized our private equity investments and what we thought was. And we defined as the energy space; my recollection is that somewhere around $760 million or so, inclusive I think. We have to go back; I am working from memory. But it\u2019s not insignificant but hardly overwhelming. So, those are the two points I\u2019d add on investment income.", "Bill Heyman", "Jay, it\u2019s Bill Heyman. What you see as seasonality is really a degradation of book yield that\u2019s gone on now for three years or four years. And we calculate it more or less to the basis points and quarter-by-quarter. And so that slope -- the slope of the slope will change over time. But the direction of the slope will persist for a while.", "Our basic allocation here which is 93% and 94% to fixed income is designed so that even if investments other than fixed income don\u2019t perform, which we know on occasion they won\u2019t, our interest revenues assuming we collect them even at these levels are enough to give the company a shot at an overall ROE in our target range. And that\u2019s the policy and that\u2019s not really an accident.", "In terms of the non-fixed income portfolio, I know we\u2019re making the comparison this morning to the first quarter of 2014, but I think it\u2019s instructed to look at this quarter against the fourth quarter of 2014 and then the fourth quarter against the third quarter of 2014. And you can see that for non-fixed income investment as a whole and the webcast and the bottom right of page six, but that includes the entire university.", "In private equity, the decline over the last two quarters was pronounced. So, this doesn\u2019t come as too much of a surprise. And given the elevated levels of the first three quarters of 2014, you can see comparisons like this again for a couple of quarters yet. What I think we can say is that since we receive results and report them to you on a quarterly lag, we try to go behind them and look at marketing conditions and determine whether there is in the portfolio some embedded but yet unreported loss that means that these marks are less accurate. We don\u2019t see that. Obviously our vision isn\u2019t perfect. But Jay Benet alluded to developments in oil prices and in the publicly held securities of these funds and we looked at equity markets generally, but it is what it is. And for what is worth real estate this quarter performed very well at levels equal to first quarter 2014. Hedge funds performed better; the shortfall was in private equity and 50% of it came from 15% of the portfolio. So, that\u2019s the story.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Go ahead.", "Josh Stirling", "Jay, I wanted to ask a follow up question on the Kai\u2019s question about where we are on pricing relative to loss trends and how that implies your future margins. So, I guess I\u2019m really curious, where do you think the breakeven point is going to be for future margin compression? If we sort of dial back, I think a year ago, maybe 3% to 4% is what a lot of companies were saying, you\u2019d want to cover loss trend with and now it\u2019s been 1.4% versus maybe the CPI something approaching to. I know there is lots of moving pieces; you mentioned some of them. But where do you think the level is that we think might be margin compression, kind of pricing levels? And if you don\u2019t mind the question; you guys have led us through this pricing cycle so far; will you draw line in the sand to preserve margins before you get to that point?", "Jay Fishman", "First, we really don\u2019t perseverate annually as much as perhaps you will do on weather margins or a little bit wider or a little bit smaller. We\u2019ve got -- I don\u2019t know, the last time I looked we have close to 1 million commercial lines accounts each one of them are priced one at a time. And so the notion that we somehow think or manage with that level of granular dynamic is just -- it\u2019s almost we occasionally show you the distribution of rate gains across the entire book and that should impress you with the diversity of it that every account is priced on its own.", "So, I start off first with philosophical answer to that, not that I won\u2019t try and answer your question; the honest answer to it is that, I just don\u2019t know. What we do believe, what we are currently recording is an aggregate overall loss trend of 4%. That remains across our entire commercial book; our business book unchanged; it\u2019s independent of whatever CPI numbers come out or producer price index. We were pretty granular about our loss trend and feel that we try hard to get right.", "The reason we try and get it right is a whole lot less about reserving than it is pricing. We price our product to losses and if we don\u2019t have our losses right, we are not going to get right price, so we get very driven and very focused on that.", "So, if you wanted to do just simple arithmetic, let\u2019s say unless you get four points of written rate, all other things being the same, margins will begin to go down, but all other things are just not the same. Exposure, we\u2019ve talked about this many times in the past, has a fair amount of activity in it that looks like rate, acts like rate, an example would be an increase in property limits on a building. You collect what premium, rent it; there are more limits at risk, but absent the total loss, that number will act in the calculation equivalent to rate. And so when we start trying to analyze it, the best answer that we can give you right now is it closed; it\u2019s closed. But again it\u2019s not as if we perseverate much at all on whether it\u2019s up a little bit or took me not up, down a little bit or flat; it\u2019s just not -- we think about returns over time, not about -- importantly not about margin in any given quarter, returns over time, it\u2019s how we think about it. So that\u2019s sort of our outlook.", "In terms of lines in the sand, we always enjoy that. It\u2019s nothing different about that. One of the things that\u2019s impressive to me and Alan shared some of this data with your couple of quarters ago: I\u2019m sure it\u2019s dated. We don\u2019t even quote on round numbers. 60% of the request reports that we get in commercial accounts; it varies, 60% to 70%, something like that. Am I close on that still, just wanted? And so the line in the sand starts right there. It\u2019s not as if -- we don\u2019t quote on more business than we do quote. And then our hit rate is a function of that smaller quote rate. So, we draw lines in the sand every single day at every account; it\u2019s not a philosophical line in the sand, it\u2019s an account by account philosophical line in the sand. And that\u2019s just so important. We don\u2019t pressure underwriters for volume, we don\u2019t. If you do, you will get volume; you won\u2019t like what you get; that\u2019s been our philosophy but you will get it. We let them run their business with tremendous amounts of data like adults making thoughtful decisions managing it for the long-term. So, now we draw lines in the sand all the time.", "Bill Heyman", "I would just add to that in terms of the line in the sand. As you heard from us, we are return focused and that\u2019s our objective as we underwrite account by account or class by class and that return will take into account interest rates; competitive conditions in the marketplace; everything else. So why we are drawing lines in the sand on account, we\u2019re not going to look at some magical return and going to say that\u2019s it, we\u2019re stopping. That\u2019s going to change and it\u2019s going to take in account all the facts and circumstances over time.", "Jay Fishman", "One of the questions that we\u2019ve been asked over a long period of time and our answer has been the same. To us, the leading indicator about lack of stability in the market and the way in which you can best assess the sort of near term is retention. It is really to me personally given my experience is remarkable that we had a record retention in our domestic business insurance business while still getting positive renewal rate. I just think that\u2019s really quite remarkable and speaks to the stability of the business. If you want to get a sense of churn, you look at retention. And I\u2019m getting a little long in the tooth but I go back to the late 60s when retentions in the middle market were in high 60s; 70 was considered a pretty stable month. This quarter in the middle market, we were like in the 87%; it just shows you the magnitude of the difference and really I think just reinforces the way in which we run the business.", "Josh Stirling", "Jay, that\u2019s really helpful. As we sort of think about simplifying now this, my guess and one follow up on that, then I\u2019ll let you guys move. If I integrate what you\u2019ve all just said which I think is sort of near your breakeven point on margin compression and you\u2019re happy with rates but in your outlook you said that basically that you expected pricing to be broadly consistent for the rest of the year with level was in the first quarter. Did that mean we should basically be interrupting that as sort of the slowing pricing trend of the past seven or eight quarters, which has been relatively stable, kind of stop here where I see you guys try to keep pricing where it is here for foreseeable future?", "Jay Benet", "So again, I\u2019ve got to fall back to the account by account discussion because that\u2019s how we think of pricing, not as a single manifest order to the organization. Some underwrite is sitting with an agent and they\u2019re talking about an account that\u2019s had -- and I use this example all the time, three consecutive years of price increases and that account has been doing just fine. And the agent and the underwriter come to conclusion that it\u2019s appropriate to renew that account flat, we are off for it; we are off for that; no issue at all.", "If the conversation is that the account absorbs a tremendous amount of cost and risk management and loss experience is kind of marginal and therefore we should be asking for a fourth consecutive increase, we will. It\u2019s by the account. What is true over all is that more of our business has moved into what one would consider return good, return acceptable than it was two, three, four years ago. So, as low as account by account decisions get made, they get made in a different framework of return to the company. We think that\u2019s great, couldn\u2019t be happier about the way our field underwriters execute on that.", "So, it\u2019s not a matter of us sending out a message that says stop here. We never would say that. Our message is, look at the account; look at the cost; look at the expenses; look at the load; look at the class of business; do you want it part of your portfolio; does the account have stability? Use your best judgment, do the right thing and we leave it to them. And that\u2019s -- so I can\u2019t -- if rate were to go flatten from here and people were pursuing that, it\u2019d be fine in the aggregate. If rate were to go down in another point and they were pursuing in that strategy, it\u2019d define. The rate in the end is the result of tens of thousands of transactions, not a single order that\u2019s given out to the field. And just to that, I would just add that on our most challenged segments of business, we continue to get rate in excess of loss trend.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes that actually is so darn important because it speaks to the granularity of the strategy that where accounts are not meeting our return expectations. We already drove in affecting and come back to that; we draw the line and we\u2019re we\u2019re getting rate at that point exceeding loss trend. So, so important for us. ", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Maybe if we could talk a little bit about the personal agency channel bid. Clearly, Quantum is having a positive impact. It looks you are winning business; getting rate and keeping retentions high and the margins look good. Just trying to understand sort of the competitive environment there and what\u2019s giving you the ability to win consistently post that Quantum 2.0 change? And is it an area of focus, a demographic or a scale advantage possibly, building risk profile of the book, something else that\u2019s giving you an opportunity to continue you to generate positive new business there? Thanks.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Hi, Mike; this is Doreen. Let me just bring it back probably a year or so, so you know what we put in place. But we actually did some back testing and what we needed to do to be more competitive in the customer segment that we wanted. And when we looked at that, we thought that our expenses needed to be adjusted. And so that\u2019s what we did. We took the $140 million out of our operating costs as well as reduced the commission on the new products. And what we told our agents -- so first of all I want to give them great credit because notwithstanding that sort of salary change, they were great partners and supported that. And what we told them was we wanted them to be competitive across channels. We weren\u2019t doing this just so they could switch one company\u2019s business to us. We wanted them to be able to compete with a captive and the direct writers. And while I wouldn\u2019t say that the price points are always what those companies are, it made us and them much more competitive in those customer segments. But I mean the whole thing, you need an organization that\u2019s willing to execute to that; you need strong agency relationships; and at the end of the day, you need a product that people want.", "Michael Nannizzi", "And have competitors reacted to kind of post this success or they kind of stuck with their? I am sure you can see from your own win rate, have others tried to replicate this success or are you still able to hold that lead?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "We can see it in little pockets Mike but nobody has really taken the approach of adjusting their cost base. So, if they are doing that with pricing, we can see a little bit of that, but nothing where we\u2019ve seen a major restructure, so that the offering would be similar.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. And then you mentioned direct really quickly; I am just curious, I mean there is obviously a little bit more increasing certainly led [ph] on some new entrants into the direct channel. Just given and maybe if we talk a little about the direct initiative at Travelers and how you are thinking about investments there and the potential for do any of these new market participants, do they provide an opportunity for Travelers or is it something that you are just kind of wait and see at this point? And thank you so much for all the answers.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "On the direct to consumer initiative, I think Jay and Greg have talked about this in the past. And we still feel like there is a very strong value proposition for the customers that we have and the advice that they get from agents. We just haven\u2019t seen sort of a run on the bank that maybe would have been predicted a decade ago. That being said, we also think it\u2019s very prudent to make sure that we have multiple channels of business, because our goal is the customers that we like, we would like to bring in the door anyway they\u2019d want to come in. All that being said, I know there has been some talk about some entrants in the marketplace. And I think I would tell you our view is to just evaluate and wait and see what that might bring. We\u2019ve made no decisions and we\u2019re in observation mode.", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s, jay Fishman. I\u2019d add a couple of points; Doreen\u2019s got it all right, which is that one of the things that is and we\u2019ve said this before, nothing new in this, but increasingly, it\u2019s in the data. The nature of the customer who chooses to buy directly is a different customer than that which seeks advice. And it\u2019s not just the nature of the customer but it\u2019s the risk management need. So broadly speaking and this comes from our experience with being a GEICO partner from many, many years, the percentage of renters and amongst GEICO customer is a multiple of what the renter population is in our agency business. The percentage of minimum and low limit buyers for Auto who buy direct are a multiple of those low limits or minimum limits that buy directly. Now that\u2019s not a 100% and it\u2019s not an absolute statement, but broadly speaking, you would say that the nature of the risk management needs based upon data, not anecdotal; not television customers but based upon the data is that they are different. Now that\u2019s in effect really good news for us, because the agency business that we direct our attention to has been much more resilient and robust than people 10 years ago might have suggested.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Sure.", "Jay Fishman", "Maybe that changes in the future; it\u2019s possible and it would be foolish of us to be arrogant enough to say that that customer could never be attracted. And so we\u2019re going to continue to develop the technology, such that if that business dynamic changes, we\u2019re in a position to respond. But several quarters ago, our conclusion was and we shared with you that the nature of the customer that we seek is not yet buying enough through direct channel that the business is a scalable business around that. To make it scalable, you have to be as that different sentiment and that\u2019s just not our sweet spot. So, I\u2019d say Gee! It would have been nice if the direct channel would have developed more robustly. But believe me when I tell you, as I had to pick one versus the other going into this, I\u2019m much happier that the Agency channel has remained more robust than people would have suspected.", "Operator", "And the next question comes; the final question comes from the line of Jay Cohen, Bank of America. Go ahead.", "Jay Cohen", "Just a couple of clean up questions, the first is can you discuss what the non-cat weather was in the quarter because with all these winter storms, certainly in the northeast, it was hard to tell what was cat and non-cat. So were the non-cat numbers elevated at all?", "Jay Benet", "Yes, Jay; this is Jay Benet. We actually had only one storm raise to the level of a cat for us. So, most of the winter storm activity that took place this quarter was non-cat weather, as we described or differentiate between cat versus non-cat. And looking at this year versus last and I think Brain made the comment, the weather in this quarter was heightened from what we would think of as a -- if there is such a thing anymore as a normal quarter was heightened from that. Last year was also a heightened weather quarter. And while the data is -- it\u2019s the voluminous data, but it\u2019s also challenging data to say exactly this is a weather loss; this isn\u2019t a weather loss. The feeling around here is that the weather losses this year were elevated from the weather losses last year, but they weren\u2019t off the charts different, they were just a bit higher than they were last year. That would be the feeling we get from the data.", "So, higher than normal; whatever normal is these days; a bad winter season last year; bad winter season this year; this year all in a little higher than last year and that would go for both cats as well as non-cat.", "Jay Cohen", "And then the second question was, you talked about I guess some of the changes in reinsurance and the impact on premiums. Can you discuss those changes and what drove the premium impact?", "Jay Benet", "The primary one is the change in the cat program that we announced last quarter. As you recall, our cat reinsurance was generally done, was always done on July 1, and the new cat aggregate treaty that we put in place was the January 1 deal. So the premium for that is primarily what we\u2019re seeing in this quarter through the seeded line that\u2019s impacting the quarter-over quarter comparisons because last year there was no premium for that.", "Jay Fishman", "It shows up in the quarter and which is amortized to be clear.", "Jay Benet", "Alright whereas last year in the third quarter of 2014, we would have seen a similar payment taking place; whereas on July 1 on this year, we will not be making that payment because we\u2019ve already made it.", "Jay Cohen", "Is easier comparison in July should be up a little bit more than expected?", "Jay Benet", "Yes.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we\u2019ll be available, Investor Relations for any follow up questions.

Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "", "Thank you Frank. Good morning and welcome to Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period.", "They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation and then we will open it for questions. Before I turn it to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note on page one of the webcast.", "Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The Company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website, travelers.com.", "With that out of the way, here is Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Well thank you Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We're very pleased with our third quarter results, having posted net income of $2.11 per share, an increase of 28% over last year and operating income of $1.81 per share, a 12% increase over last year's amount", "Operating return on equity was a strong 14.3% and we experienced very solid underwriting results across each of our business segments. Our consolidated GAAP combined ratio was 19.6%.", "In an insurance pricing environment that remains largely flat in the commercial businesses, we were pleased to produce an increase of 2% net written premiums for the quarter.", "Investment returns remained reduced from historical patterns as remarkably low interest rates, particularly short rates continue to impact net investment income. Lastly we've grown our book value from year-end 2009 by 13% to $59.11, a in a very strong quarter.", "This morning we're going to do things a bit differently than we have in previous quarters. All of the data that we have historically provided is still included in our webcast.", "However we're only going to hit the highlights and you can review the details on your own and obviously Gabby is available later to take any questions you may have. Instead, we're going to take the opportunity to share a few additional insights into our business that we think you'll find interesting.", "First, we've spoken at length in previous presentations about our program's design to grow our business organically. This morning we're going to share with you summery analytics of our business insurance account growth and we suspect that a number of you will be surprised with the growth we've achieved. Second, a number of you have asked about the impact of reduced interest rates on our net investment income.", "Jay Benet shared an analysis of the impact of reinvestment rates at an investor conference in September and we've updated it for current conditions. We've analyzed the maturities in our fixed income portfolio for the next three years and we'll share with you the projected impact on net investment income if re investment rates remain at current levels.", "The municipal bond environment remains a topic of some interest. We've updated an analysis of our municipal bond portfolio that we did for the second quarter webcast based on current ratings and market conditions. As we've said before, it is an actively managed portfolio where we are constantly evaluating risk and return of individual securities. There are never any guarantees but we couldn't be more pleased with the positioning of the portfolio.", "Finally, before I turn it over to Jay Benet, I want to comment on a topic that we're thinking about regularly. As we've discussed before we believe the most thoughtful way to run a property casualty business for the long term is to produce superior returns on equity. As many of your understand, we can't promise consistent growth in either revenues or earnings and do so maintaining a thoughtful risk profile.", "Consequently a number of years ago consistent with our aspiration for superior returns on equity and given what we viewed as typical underwriting and investment environments. We determined that we will target a mid-teens return on equity overtime and do so by achieving top tier profitability and returning access capital to shareholders.", "Two very important origin that previous sentence are overtime. Since January 2005 the first full year after the merger of St. Paul and Travelers, our average annual operating return on equity is 14.1%, then we have recorded more than $20 billion in operating income and have returned nearly $17 billion in total shareholders, $13 billion in share repurchases and nearly $4 billion in dividends. Given the current general economic and investment environments few people have asked whether we intend to change our goal now.", "We are certainly not economists nor do we what the future holds. However, the underlying assumption we are making is that the economy will eventually return to a more typical investment environment particularly with respect to the fixed income world.", "Consequently we are not changing our goal now, having said that we have been very clear in the recent past that the current environment simply doesn't permit achievement of a consistent mid-teens return right now if one assumes no favorable reserve development and normal catastrophes in weather costs.", "If in fact the market ultimately presents long term meaningfully reduced investment returns not only for us but also for the market at large which for us are not offset by improved underwriting conditions.", "We will obviously rethink what that means for our aspirations and what investors can expect of us. So for now our target remains intact and we continue to execute in the marketplace consistent with that goal.", "We seek rate selectively and thoughtfully where weight is needed especially in those cases where account loss experience has been inconsistent with our underwriting expectations.", "But we are always managing rate and retention with a clear view of maximizing long term value to our arbitrarily and aggressively seek rate and be a victim of adverse selection and watch our retention drop perfidiously will not be a smart or thoughtful reaction to the current environment. As Brian will explain in greater detail our field people take their lead from us and right now their direction is unambiguous.", "We feel great about how they are executing and we believe that we will continue to be amongst the best performing property and casualty companies around. With that let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay, I would like to start with a few overall comments about the quarter relating to page four through 10 of the webcast. Operating results ex-cap and favorable reserve development and including net investment income were generally inline with our expectations as they have been all year.", "The third quarter results benefited from a relatively low level caps a $117 million pre-tax which was lower than prior year CAT losses of a 158 million pre-tax as well as what we \u201cnormally planned for in the third quarter\u201d. I would remind you though that year-to-date CAT losses have been quite high over a $1 billion on a pre-tax basis as compared to 441 million pre-tax in the first nine months of last year which would approximate a more normal year-to-date amount.", "We had another quarter of net favorable prior year reserve development in each of our segments concentrated this quarter in DI and FPII. The quarters reserve development included and asbestos reserve increase of a $140 million pre-tax. Included in this asbestos reserve increase and therefore in the current quarters operating income was a $70 million pre-tax benefited related to the recent favorable ruling we received against Munich Re and certain members of (inaudible).", "The total awarded to us by the court in this ruling was $417 million, broken down as follows, $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement and interest of $166 million.", "Based upon this ruling, we reduced our uncollectible reinsurance reserve by $70 million, thereby reflecting in our financial statements the full $251 million owed to us under the terms of the reinsurance agreement. Importantly the benefit of the $166 million interest award was not reflected in either the current quarter asbestos charge or in the current quarter's operating income since GAAP requires its interest to be treated as a contingent gain generally until all appeals have been exhausted and or the dollar amount is received.", "All of our capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. We are holding company liquidity at $2.8 billion at the end of the quarter, which was more than twice the target level due to the timing of share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies for our holding company.", "During the third quarter we repurchased $600 million of our common shares, a higher amount than we would normally repurchase in the third quarter due to the strength of our balance and the light wind season we have experienced thus far and paid $169 million in common stock dividends bringing the total cash we returned to our shareholders in the past nine months to almost $4 billion. Third quarter operating ROE was 14.3% and book value for share once again increased, up 6% in the quarter and up 15% from a year ago.", "Page 4 makes reference to our very high quality investment portfolio which includes a $4.6 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain at the end of the third quarter; up significantly from the $2.8 billion pre-tax net unrealized gain we recorded at the beginning of the year. A little over 60% of the net unrealized gain relates to the muni bond portfolio.", "Page 5 provides an update of certain data we previously provided to you related to our muni bond portfolio. There have not been any significant changes in the portfolio recently, not withstanding our active management of the portfolio based upon a risk reward view for each individual holding due to its very high quality.", "The portfolio currently includes bonds that have gross unrealized gains of $2.8 billion pre-tax and bonds that have gross unrealized losses of only $8 million. That's right, only $8 million of losses, not billions.", "I'd also like to make some specific comments related to page 9 of the webcast. During a presentation I made at a recent conference, I referred to today's low interest rate environment and provided an illustration based upon our portfolio schedule bond maturities in 2011, 2012 and 2013 of the impact on net investment income in those years. If the current interest rate environment persists through this period of time and all of the variables such as average assets, mix, credit quality and duration remain constant.", "The illustration I provided at the conference was based upon reinvesting a 10 year rate or approximately 100 basis points lower than the combined yield on the maturing bonds, rounding the interest rate differential to the nearest 50 basis points.", "Since then interest rates have fallen even further and we have updated the illustration to reflect a 150 basis point interest rate decline. We've also added another line to the illustration which shows the differential between NII and the subsequent years. Again all other variables being held constant that includes the partial year impact of reinvesting 2010 maturities at lower interest rates. The full year impact of this activity will not be felt until 2011 in subsequent years since 2010 maturities will have taken place throughout 2010 rather than on the first day of the year.", "As you model these years I would also remind you that NII will also be impacted by the reduction and average invested assets that results from our share repurchase program and with that let me give the mike over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks Jay. Our typical disclosures on the business segment is also around pages 11 through 22 and we will of course take questions on any topic. Instead of going through the slides I will give a few perspectives on our businesses and the marketplace. In business insurance we continue to be very pleased with the positioning of our franchisee. Both our account retention and flow of new business opportunities remain near historically high levels which we believe will enable us to grow premiums if and when the economy improves.", "Core underwriting margins continue to contract modestly in the quarter consistent with both prior quarters and our expectations. In short the loss cost trend slightly outpaced through the rate changes.", "We continue to see the negative impact as the economy is having on our insured exposures. Audit premiums which are retroactive premium adjustments charged to reflect changes and insured pay roll, vehicles, property values or business receipts have improved but are still negative.", "The exposure change on renewals which is a perspective look has also improved throughout the year and is now approaching zero. On a combined basis these impacts are reducing premiums approximately 2% through the third quarter.", "So in another word our data suggest that the economy is bottoming out but we don't see any evidence at current economic expansion. Given these trends our underwriting strategy remains consistent. Retain our quality business, optimize the profitability on this retained book by getting rate where it is warranted and write new business for long term profitable growth. Directionally this strategy maybe the same as many of our competitors but aligning it with our competitive advantages namely our talent, technology, actionable management information and breadth of distribution, we believe we are very well positioned.", "Over the last seven quarters we have seen significant account growth and as a result we believe that we are growing market share. On slide 16, you can see that since year end 2008 we have grown accounts in business insurance by 8.5% compound annual growth rate.", "On the next slide we have taken this data and broken it out for two of our major businesses. In our small commercial business or select accounts you can see that it is growing by a 10.6% CAGR. This increase has been driven by our select express product that's our no touch insurance solution for small business customers.", "Through the combination of our sophisticated rating capability and cost efficient frontline delivery we are able to provide our agents and customers with an industry leading product and platform.", "Within select in the plus end or the larger end of this market we have allowed our accounts to be decreased due to extremely competitive market conditions.", "On the slide you can also see that we have grown commercial accounts by 4.4% compound annual growth rate. The increase in the number of accounts in this business is driven primarily by the continued introduction of the new products and the specialization and expertise of these products and our front line underwriting and claim staff bring to the marketplace.", "This growth in commercial accounts is representative of what we are seeing across our middle market businesses. So we're encouraged by this increase in the number of accounts and again if and when the economy improves the resulting impact on exposure should create a compelling written premium trend.", "Given both this top line dynamic and the current core underwriting profitability of this book of business, we remain very pleased with business insurance current performance and its position in the marketplace moving forward.", "In the financial professional and international segment, I will make just a few overall comments. First, writings in our international businesses are down compared to prior year quarter as we are addressing risk in pricing in light of catastrophe and other severe weather losses over the past year.", "Secondly, although we remain very pleased with the market position and quality of our construction surety business. The impact of the economy on construction spending has resulted in fewer new business opportunities and are writings in this quarter reflect this.", "And lastly, we continue to monitor the analysis on impacts of the financial marketplace disruptions on our management liability business and our conclusions remain the same. That is our losses are developing within or slightly favorable to our expectations.", "Turning to personnel insurance, we're extremely pleased with both the underwriting and production results in the quarter. In both agency, auto and property policies in force continue to grow and core underwriting margins expanded as earned rate increases outpaced loss cost trends.", "In our property line of business, weather losses were both less than third quarter expectations and a welcome relief from the pattern we saw in the first half of the year. While the continental U.S. was not meaningfully impacted by any of the storms generated during the peak of the hurricane season, the number of near misses this quarter highlights the importance of underwriting controls and risk management policies in this business.", "Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market with quarter-over-quarter pip growth remaining at historically high levels. In agency auto our new business continued to improve and we had our best quarter-over-quarter policies in force increase since the end of 2008", "Given the continued expansion in core underwriting margins and strong top line trends, we remain pleased with both our current and going forward positions in these businesses.", "So across all of our businesses we feel great about our execution in the marketplace and one the primary reasons we believe our organization has executed so well in these times of uncertainty is that we have kept our message to the field clear, unambiguous and consistent. And that is and in these market conditions, just like pretty much any other, the role of our underwriters is to maximize the long term value of the portfolio to balance the desire to keep our quality business well at the same time optimizing the returns on that portfolio.", "Fundamentally, they do that by making sure they understand the accounts risk characteristics and can estimate the potential losses from these exposures. They then seek the select risks in the marketplace where the premium level is appropriate for this view of the losses.", "We believe our field understands their role as the best tools in the business to execute and as long as they keep doing this we will keep competing in the marketplace successfully. With that, let me turn it back over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thanks Brian. Page 23 summarizes our updated guidance for full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share which we've increased from the previous range of $5.20 to a range of $5.75 to $5.95. In round numbers this should translate into an operating ROE of just under 12%. We're now assuming cut losses of $765 million after tax or $1.58 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual catalogue for the first nine months of the year and our original estimate for the fourth quarter.", "No further estimates of prior reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, a low single digit decrease in average invested assets, ex-unrealized gains and losses this whole thing from a reduction of holding company with liquidity due to the share repurchases. Full year share repurchases of 4.5 to 5 billion and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards of approximately 485 million shares. Jay would like to say some additional comments before we go to Q&A.", "Jay Benet", "", "Thanks Jay. Just before we open it up we had a pretty good run here for sometime and the folks around this table I think actually get an undue amount of credit for that performance. We have publicly acknowledged all the folks of the investment department, we have done a remarkable job in unprecedented conditions of keeping this company moving ahead but the fact is I want and our own folks listen to these calls and I just want to spend 15 seconds letting 10,000 people know that we recognize that the business is done in the field and trade at a time and we couldn't be more appreciative of the underwriting discipline and the thoughtfulness and your attention.", "And I don't care whether their commercial lines underwriters or personal underwriters, but they refrain the technology or opts risk control. This is a complicated business I mean by 30,000 folks who understand it to keep the organization moving ahead and I just wanted to take a minute and say thanks and with that we are ready to go for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "", "Operator", "", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi. Please proceed.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "", "Hey, good morning everybody. I guess first for Brian on auto, I guess a lots of talk in the industry about positive rate trends. So, why the decision here to loosen in terms of conditions with the 12 month product and also if you can comment on the direct initiative where we stand and I have got a follow-up. Thanks.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "", "Hey Keith this is Greg Toczydlowski from Personal Insurance. On the annual policy first of all take that one. There is a number of dynamics that we look at and the annual policy. Some of them being agency selling behavior, retention and pricing and we look at all those dynamics together we thought it was the appropriate time to drive that inside the business and I think the margins and the growth are showing that. That's clearly not the only feature that we have been throwing out there into the market as a positive impact.", "And when we look at all them we feel good about having that in the product.", "Brian MacLean", "", "I will just make an observation on that agency costs matter very much in the equation too and instead of yielding obviously two rules a year you deal with one not an insignificant difference. On the direct initiative you don't actually have lots to say, we continue on course with the plan that we set. We said we are going to be investing and losing money and in fact we are on positive sides. We are beginning to learn a fair amount about the customers that respond. What they find attractive in the value equation and I will let you know if are doing about 5000 policies a month in our direct initiative now. So we are on our way to learning but make no mistake we view it as a very long term investment.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Okay and then Jay just a follow-up on pricing I mean I acknowledge your comments that you said, the ROEs has been very strong last several years but the chart show clear price deterioration and why the continued focus on growing in certain business lines here when clearly the accident of your ROE is probably sub 10 at this point. Thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "I think the second half of your question or the statement is actually just in error. We look at a lot of data. In fact I'm not sure anyone analyses data any better or more robustly than we and I will tell you that even assuming current reinvestment rates now, current reinvestment rates now, the portfolio, meaning the combination of renewal and new, on our business insurance business is not in single digits. It's actually better than that.", "Now the dynamic is we're focused on -- and I hope my comments really were fairly specific about this, we are focused on retention and I would say taking new business selectively. No one should come to the conclusion that we are focused on growth. There isn't anything in the comments or in the data that would give anyone -- should point anyone to the conclusion that we're focusing on growth as the word you use. It is a very selective approach. It is not only based on price but its risk selection. We spend most of the time on these calls speaking about rate. Our folks in the (inaudible) spend most of their time focused on the risk selection.", "So it's as I said a complex business where you're balancing elements. I just couldn't be more pleased with how we're managing through this largely unprecedented environment.", "Keith Walsh - Citi", "Okay, thanks for clarifying.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Two questions. I'll just ask both and let you guys address them. The first is Brian I think you mentioned that your kind of core combined ratio in business insurance have gotten worse but it looks like its gotten better and I'm wondering what's driving that, that ex development, ex catastrophes. And then secondly, maybe for Jay Fishman, when you think about your ROE, are you making any adjustments for your own cost of equity capital and given the changes interest rates presumably that has come down as well.", "Brian MacLean", "So first on the combined ratio and I'll throw it to Jay Benet for some of the specifics but obviously every quarter there is stuff running through the combined. We still see when we net out everything that we think is unusual a slight deterioration in what we call the core combined ratio. But Jay, why don't you go through some of the changes.", "Jay Benet", "Yeah Jay, in any period, a period comparison we try to look at as Brian said what are the key core underlying trends of price and loss cost but there are also things that will impact it. Small weather, not cut weather in quarter versus another year-to-date, one year versus another; we've talked in the past about large loss activity. Last year we made a re-estimation of the full year loss pick for business insurance in the fourth quarter. We also did that in the third quarter but when you do that it impacts prior quarters of the current year. So I think when you see the full year results, you'll see more of what Brian is talking about and if there are impacts associated with large loss activity and small weather we'll try to point that out as well.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That makes sense. Thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "In terms of the return on equity, it's actually an awfully simple story. The return on equity that we publish in our press release and in our financials is straightforward GAAP return on equity which is the earnings that we reported for the period divided by average equity for the period and Jay and Doug can take you through all of that. We obviously understand that if our entire $70 billion investment portfolio were re-priced today at today's reinvestment rates, that we would end up with a different return.", "We understand that, internally the analytics that we have we actually do look at it that way. We actually do evaluate products and businesses and lines based upon investing cash flows at today's available rates and it's those analytics that form the basis of our pricing strategy and our growing strategy and they are proprietary.", "They are important, they are the subject of substantial discussion here and it's that return that gives us our approach to whether we are aggressively growing, not aggressively growing or willing to strength. Brian spoke today about letting the large end of select strength because we are pricing with such and the risk selection effect that the returns are simply aren't adequate to support business.", "So we are letting that shrink somewhat. And certainly we understand one of the reasons that Jay presented the schedule that he did about investment income is that if these investment markets continue. If they are what they are and the underwriting environment never changes and there is no favorable development. Now we are not going to be able to achieve mid-teens return on equity and we certainly understand that and it's actually not all that difficult to model out the business and see what you think it is.", "We certainly do it all the time and it can be achieved. So we talk pretty simple, the numbers that you get in press release and GAAP things we are all getting and internally we have robust analytics that left us evaluate the current underwriting profitability based up on today's reinvestment rate and that's what establishes our underwriting energy or enthusiasm.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I appreciate. I guess my question really surrounded the hurdle way what you need, in another words if you are comparing your ROE versus your own cost of equity capital if that cost of capital has come down shouldn't the hurdle rate comedown as well naturally.", "Jay Benet", "", "Well that actually gets to the comments that I made and is just absolutely spot on. There has at least in my career never been a period with a gap between the cost of debt and the cost of equity has been any wider than it is today. I find it actually remarkable that they are high quality equities with the dividend is actually higher than the debt yield on the ten year debt, high quality companies.", "So it tells you that the market place is at the moment somewhat upside down and the real question that you are asking and I think it's extra-ordinarily relevant one is that is going to continue and possibly been in an environment where the two year treasury is a 2.4% and the cost of equity is a 10 or will there not be arbitrage activities that will take place. But in one fashion or another we will lower that gap, reduce that gap into a more normal historical rage. We are extremely attentive to it. One can speculate that one way that cost of equity will go down is a rising equity market and some folks have asked me why do you think the market is generally is rising now. One of the answers to it is that it's reflecting at a decline cost of equity. It's somewhat kind of intuitive to think of it that way but frankly it's entirely possible.", "So, I don't know what the cost of equity will be in a few years. My guess is that you got a financial company ten years from now in today's environment and you look back three years from now and the company has achieved a 10% cumulative return on equity and you will feel great.", "You won't feel good, you will feel great and if you look broadly at the financial services arena and we do and I do and you will look at the returns that institutions of producing particularly in the banking arena where the rules and regulations and levels of dynamics are changing so much I think that the dynamic of what returns are going to be over the next few years is a fascinating question and what it is that investors are going to seek but my comment was for now our goal is our goal.", "We will do the best we can. We are not going at arbitrarily and go out through the marketplace and say, the worst thing in the world to do is to go out to the marketplace and say we want five points of rate on every account. You'll get five points of rate on accounts that need 10 and you'll lose accounts that don't need any.", "The easiest way to get adverse selection is to take away the underwriters authority to evaluate risk and return on an individual trade. So no mystery here. We acknowledge the environment is not possible right now, nothing we can achieve with these returns. But the two words overtime are just critical to us and that's how we think about. This is a long term business and we manage it over time.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thanks Jay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Yeah, good morning. Two questions here. First one, I was hoping Jay if you could talk about the general administrative expenses in the business and circuited the big, big drop this quarter. Anything unusual going on there and I have one follow-up.", "Jay Fishman", "I'm going to sound like I'm repeating myself a little bit from Jay Cohen's question but as it relates to the expenses and again in any quarter you can have some things go up and some things go down. I think last year we had some assessments that came through in the third quarter. This year we had some credits that came through in the third quarter. I think overall that we've been very thoughtful in trying to manage our expenses and keep the expense ratio in line and those are kinds of things that have created the period to period variability but there is nothing in particular from an operational standpoint that's driving it. We do have differences and timing of things like advertising cost and travel that go through. So I can't think of anything in particular that I'd point to that says this is a fundamental change.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Is there like an underlying rate we can think about that our expense is kind of flat or are down a little bit. Just trying to kind of think about it going forward. I don't want to essentially drop expenses by 10% a quarter here going forward.", "Jay Fishman", "That's I would say relatively flat, particularly if you look at it on an expense ratio basis.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Okay, okay. Terrific. And then the second question for Brian, lost cost inflation in the commercial lines area, we've heard a little bit this quarter about some tick up and some loss costs inflation from some other companies. I'm wondering what you're seeing.", "Brian MacLean", "So splitting it into two pieces, frequency for us has been very flat and granted that is compared to last year and the year before where we were having some significant declines in frequency and in some of our businesses. So the declines have leveled off but we're still pretty pleased with where they are leveling off at. The core loss inflation or severity component of it is pretty benign. It's not a zero. It's a plus number. But it's a mid to low single digits plus number. So overall loss inflation continues to be in a pretty good place for us.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from KBW. Please proceed.", "Cliff Gallant - KBW", "Good morning. Two questions. First, pretty simple, there was recent news about Chinese Drywall in a settlement that looks like state farm was reaching. I was wondering if you had any comment on or an update on your view on Chinese Drywall and then second, I was wondering if you can to speculate on a sort of a larger basis, what you think the industry accident year combined ratios are or should the industry actually here the combined ratios, should the industry exit your ROEs look like in comparison to what you are reporting.", "Jay Benet", "", "We have enough trouble keeping track of our own. We are going to pass on try and estimate what the industry is.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "", "Good morning This is Doreen. I will take your Chinese Drywall question. Bottom-line we haven't seen anything that would cause us to change our view that we talked about previously. I think we showed you slide in the first quarter. We just don't think it creates a significant exposure to us and basically what's changed the first quarter as we have probably got a few more insured that had made claims against us and that on the positive side we actually had a ruling in the District Court in Virginia finding that our home owners policy is not provide coverage for Chinese Drywall.", "The State Farm settlement, there has been some multi-district issues, there are two cases pending that have a lot of class action plaintiffs as well as a number of defendant. And some companies that have had large home owner populations have chosen to participate with some of those settlements where you have seen some of the Chinese Drywall manufacturers and some distributors putting in some dollars but for us we have not participated in those given where our exposure is and the positive ruling that we received.", "Cliff Gallant - KBW", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "", "Hi. Good morning everybody. Two questions, first could you give us a little bit more color on the BI account growth slide you showed. I guess I will be curious when whether or not there is a dramatic difference in accounts size for the new accounts versus maybe the existing book if you go back to year end '08.", "And also just given what we have seen in premium, could you maybe just discuss how the exposure trends at those new accounts maybe contrast with exposure trend change on the existing book and then I will have a follow-up.", "Jay Fishman", "", "For starters on the mix dynamic within the account growth, what we try to break out the small commercial from the middle market and obviously the small commercial. We are absolutely growing it from a mixed perspective in the smaller array. So, that's driving some of the dynamic of the total but within that the express component of small commercial which would have a fairly consistent account sizes growing dramatically. So we feel good about that.", "Jay Benet", "And importantly just in other terms, Select Express is the technology platform that we introduce now I don't know maybe three years ago and that has really dramatically changed the way what smallest end of our small commercial business is processed. I have discussed this before but the predecessor platform was 20% underwritten in the technology, 80% was referred out to underwriters for review. This is a very slow approach to the smallest end of the business, 80% now is done in the technology and only 20% comes out for human intervention.", "So it is dramatically different, this platform is the basis of the flow significant increase in quote activity that we have seen from ages. We are just been quoted a whole lot more with this platform because it's easier and more efficient and as a result that business is growing significantly. It is the smallest end of the small commercial business.", "Jay Fishman", "And I think Matt and correct me if I am wrong, just to your question are we getting the growth just because we are shifting mix or do we think we are actually growing like type of accounts and the answer is there is a piece of it that's mixed but the bulk of it is we're growing light type of accounts. So.", "Jay Benet", "Yes, in the middle businesses, the average account size that we're bringing in that was fairly consistent with our renewal book of business and the difference between the total gross is basically the exposure, the audit premium and the renewal exposure change that you're increasing your overview.", "Brian MacLean", "And help me a little bit with the second half of what you are asking.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "You got to it with the last comment. So that's helpful. The other question I had was, I need to follow up on Brian, actually maybe I'll ask a different one, on the direct side, I guess are you out of -- you used the -- I think you used the word experiment Jay but it looks like the premium volume is starting to decelerate sequentially kind of low to mid $20 million on a quarterly basis. You would expect that to grow I would assume but I guess are you proactively kind of trying to restrain the growth in that channel till you ensure you kind of understand the dynamics or you are now at a point where growth will be what it will be, you kind of have a more clear view of the appetite and some of the variables that you want to pay attention to.", "Jay Fishman", "I'll give you my perspective and I'll Greg to chime in as well. It's sure closer to the former than the later. We're actually -- I wouldn't say constraining. That's not quite the word but what we are doing is we're only doing that amount of business that we need to do to continue to advance the learning and the learnings are how do we get a customer to respond to an ad, how do we get that customer either through our call center or our technology platform to actually end up with quote, how do we convert that quote to a sale and then most importantly, who are we bringing in and what's the loss experience. What we -- you've said -- the pricing track we're using for direct is the same pricing track we use at our agency plant. It is our presumption that the loss experience between those two groups will be different, that the act of where one purchases is an identifying characteristic -- a projecting characteristic of loss experience. So we're just trying to do enough to keep the learnings moving ahead. We are not remotely at the level now where its goal, invest in advertising dramatically, or whatever we can do, we can do. If you can add to that.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "I'd just echo Jay's comments. We spend a lot of time watching the economics and the operational expectations of the business and they're both right within the target of where we want to be. As Jay said, the function of the top line is how we advertise, how we entertain ourselves out in the digital space and clearly that's the amount of investment that we put in this. I think it's a fair assumption that if you look at the last three quarter's run rate, that's a fair assumption of what we could expect for this business to continue running at both months going forward and as Jay said we're really trying to really maximize our learning with minimizing the investments inside this business and as we get more of those learning's we'll continue to grow the business. We're very cautious in how we're doing it.", "Jay Fishman", "We didn't characterize it by the way as an experiment. The implication of that is that we're committed to making this work and it will take years -- it will take years for us to get to the point where it gets to break even or frankly becomes profitable but we are committed to getting there and what we're doing is to Greg's exact point, is balancing the cost of investment with the value of the learnings that come out of it.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay, that's fair. That was my poor word choice. I guess based on your last comment and isn't it fair to kind of think about quantum has a parallel in terms of -- because I think there was about a 24 month period of kind of rolling that out and to the point where you were kind of fully comfortable just letting it run. So it sounds be much longer.", "Brian MacLean", "", "Yeah it takes much longer than that. Yes.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "", "Thank you. I want to ask a broader picture of question on the situation with the bank dislocation with regard to mortgage servicing. Could you talk about how or what the implications might be from the insurance side on that from a Directors and Officers and Arizona's mission perspective as well as what the implications could be for Travelers investment portfolio. Thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "", "Let me take the first piece of that related to the insurance business. It's early days and when I say early days I mean in the context that we are still learning about the facts and circumstances and so it's hard to really come up with a definitive insurance exposure perspective in that environment but having said that you are taking a look at our exposure to the top 15 mortgage services and our exposure is really very, very limited there and that is in some respects of fall out of the credit crisis underwriting we have been doing going back to the first to second quarter of 2007.", "So all the big names that you and we have been reading about in the news, we have very, very limited exposure there.", "We don't view it as an exposure really to the community banks and we think that's because they just haven't been foreclosing the kinds of volumes that would involve the processes that is really in question here and we haven't seen any indication if that's the case.", "So at least early days from the insurance perspective we are not doing it as an outside issue.", "Jay Benet", "", "On the investment side just suppose to couple of facts. First our entire portfolio of subprime and also ABS is are actually $300 million and $200 million of that was 2004 and prior and we have added $100 million selectively since the crisis began. So, not a significant investment there, still very highly rated.", "On the residential CMO side that $2.3 billion of that again virtually all 2004 and prior we turned away from the market as both the mortgage market and the real estate market really heated up.", "862 million of it is agency and 1.4 billion is non-agency. The facts and circumstances of this what actually is happening and the implications are as confusing as I have ever seen it, and it's not at all clear what the long term issue really is. If we are talking about episodic relatively short term delays in foreclosure activity, our assessment is no problem with respect to the investments and we have already seen some of that episodic short term delay.", "And the other extreme is the notion of a long term industry wide broad-based foreclosure moratorium. We don't know how to access that, I don't know how to access some thing that actually has never happened before and frankly I think of all of the issues that will incur the impact of asset backed securities may actually be the smallest in that kind of environment.", "So I don't know to size up that kind of long term broad-based moratorium. Again the episodic short term stuff we could be wrong on this but our assessment is no underlying problem.", "With respect to the flip side of the issue which is the ability to put mortgages back to the originating institutions, of course the GFCs have always have had that. There is nothing particularly no on that front and again we could be wrong on this but our assessment has been that it's hard for us to figure out a scenario where mortgages get put back to the originating institution and the bond holders lose -- the originating institution seems to me it could be in a position to lose but we have some difficulty figuring out the scenario where the bond holder loses but early days on this would even be an understatement. It's right at the beginning. Bill?", "Bill Cunningham", "I wouldn't add much. You obviously read the story about Pimco and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York sending to Bank of America with a list of 115 tools, where they would like to see mortgages put back. We looked at that list. We own three of them. We think -- I think there are three cross currants. One the validity of foreclosures which have taken place, two the ability on our perspective basis to foreclose and courts are beginning to get more particular in terms of what they demand and that's probably good. And three the whole put back phenomenon and they would cut differently across the portfolio. My guess is the probability of any of the three having a significant impact to us or anyone else, that might be more remote than the newspapers are suggesting and whatever happens is going to happen over time to the extent that if there was a put back phenomenon we would benefit. It's easier for GSEs to put back mortgages than non agency pools because all the GSEs have to do this pool they weren't confirming. So we'd be beneficiaries but we're not counting on much.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks and that was very comprehensive. Just to circle back to the property casualty exposure, is there a standalone mortgage servicing E&O type of coverage that would be meant to respond to that or is that all sort of lumped into the in the E&O programs if there is availability for that these days.", "Bill Cunningham", "When we think about our exposure its way heavily weighted toward the D&O and E&O side and again underweight on the larger institutions. They is coverage that I think is available in that market. We just don't write a lot of it.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Hi good morning. On the personal order side, could you provide some color on your PIF growth in the agencies channel? Some of it by end that the direct way is the way to go and you seem to be growing in that channel pretty well.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Its Greg Toczydlowski again. We've been focused very much on a couple of areas. One that we talk about earlier is some of the features in the automobile is some of our geographic expansion. We've seen an under penetration in the mid-west and the west and we've been appointing agents out there over the past few years and based on those two really its been driving some of the sequential PIF growth that we have inside the book of business.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay, that's great. The second question is on pricing in the business insurance. It appears that you're happier to take maybe pricing is done just a tad just to keep your business and to grow a little. Just wanted your perspective on the risk to that strategy. We are at all time historical lows in terms of frequencies. Do you think that this is the right time maybe to grow your business?", "Jay Fishman", "Well I'll let Brian step in but I want to start off with the premise that the tactical and strategic imperative number one two and three is retention and again somehow the conversation always seems to kind of drive to growth but we start out with a focus that the book of business that we have is the book of business that we understand, that's priced appropriately that's got highest return and so we approach our retention book in a very, very thoughtful kind of way.", "The growth dynamics that you are seeing here in the charts, the account growth, I got to go back and talk to the fact that once been driven by Select Express which is a technology platform that lowers cost, lowers agent cost and lowers our cost significantly and so it's been a platform based dynamic of growth not price based. A platform based dynamic of growth and in Bill Cunningham's in his middle market business it's really been about new product development and role out. We have provided lots of information about that previously not a price driven strategy and again the data. It's so clear that it supports this, you are looking at retention that is historical highs and renewal pricing that's more or less a flat a little below or flat and so our focus is not and it destined to get confused to some folks is not to cut price too aggressively grow our book.", "It's to use our competitive advantages where they exist, like the express, like the new product development in middle market that allows us to the geography that Greg spoke about. Where there are ways to grow your business without being pricing competitive to do it.", "Brian MacLean", "And then the other dynamic within pricing and you used the right words, I mean if you look at any of our business insurance statistics that are in the package. The negative price that we are talking about is it's somewhere around a negative one but and we have talked about this a lot in the past and Jay touched on it. It's the spread across the portfolio that really matters there. If we were getting minus one on each and every account that's one strategy, we have got accounts in here where we are getting plus 10s and we have got accounts that are certainly getting minus 10s. It's blending to something pretty close to neutral. We feel good about the profitability about our book and we wake up every morning wanting to retain most of the accounts.", "So, I think to characterize our strategy is taking down prices to grow, in our minds it's not consistent with how we think about it but.", "Jay Benet", "", "And I want to take the opportunity to clarify something because I am quite certain Gabby will get ten calls before the end of the day on this and it gets back to the analytics but I was keeping you that before that evaluates returns on a investment return basis today.", "Let me be a little more specific. So we are talking about allocating capital. Each of our products, each of our business is based up on the duration and the volatility are actually defined and amount of capital too.", "The embedded return that we calculate for the portfolio assumes that the premium dollars come in at new investment rates but that the capital, because the capital sits and just continues to roll has a much longer duration so the capital that supports it is somewhat more reflective of the historical capital embedded in the portfolio.", "So, premiums come in entirely at new money rates. Again this is the analytics that we use, the capital based up on allocated capital to that product reflecting more of the historical duration kind of because again it supports the business as one piece of business rolls off and new piece of business comes on. The capital has a different duration than the new premium base and if you look at the business insurance segment in the aggregate as we did just yesterday and making sure that we can answer this question.", "The policy view, the return that we see in the business that we are writing today is very low double digit. That's where we fall; I don't want to get more specific than that because obviously it's reflecting of our pricing strategy. But it wouldn't take much to move into high single digits but its very low double digits.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay, that's fair. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Hi good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the holding company liquidity and get an update. I can't get the math to reconcile. I'm looking at the end of the second quarter. I added net investment -- I'm sorry, net income, took out share repo and dividends and it looks like liquidity was almost a couple of hundred million higher. Could you help reconcile the math there? Was there a dividend in the quarter perhaps?", "Jay Fishman", "Let's say, at the beginning of the quarter, for holding company liquidity we had about $2.4 billion. The way the mechanics of this thing are taking dividends out of the operating companies and bringing them up to the holding company. I mean there are other things that impact it like stock option and equity awards. That's a relatively small number. Tax has come into play. There is going on the other way interest on the corporate debt, shareholder dividend, stock repurchases themselves, any pension plan funding we do. So those are the components of it. I'm not sure you can really have full visibility to all those components but what ends up happening is that the 2.4 grows to 2.8 and the two major drivers of that are the size of the dividends coming up from the operating companies versus the amount of share repurchases that go out.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, but there was no special dividend. Like if I recall in the first quarter did you take a special dividend up and there was nothing in the quarter?", "Jay Fishman", "No we had a dividend in the quarter. Let me clarify what's going on with the dividends. I think in our 10-K at the beginning of the year of course, we had indicated that we could take dividends up without special authorization of something around $3.5 billion is my recollection. Somebody is going to look that up for me. But we also said during the first or second quarter, I'm not sure which one was that based on the capital positions of the operating companies which had gotten very robust, we were actually going to go to our regulators and say that we wanted to take capital out of the operating companies at a higher level than that would have indicated and get their authority to do that which we did and we did that in the first quarter. And when you do that it also changes the dynamics going forward of what constitutes normal dividend versus what constitutes a special dividend. So in each of the quarters we have gone to our regulators and said we'd like to take X out and in each of the quarters we've been given permission to do that. But its all in conjunction with a strategy as Jay has talked about of always rightsizing the capital at the place and you've heard me say before that we manage to a certain level of capital and the operating companies to support the AA ratings and that's what all we're doing. So our regulators understand that, the rating agencies understand it and it's just what's flowing through right now.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, so just to be clear the, so when we take your end of period holding company liquidity and we -- all we get is kind of what net income and then we know what you're buying back and we know what you are giving to your shareholders. What you are saying is there is an amount that you guys are going to the regulators intra quarter and requesting to take up from the subsidiaries and so -- and that doesn't necessarily correlate one to one with net income", "Jay Benet", "", "That's correct, I mean we take money out of the operating companies each quarter because we are making money in the operating companies each quarter and if you look and if you take a big picture view of what we have been saying for the year. Our guidance is for share repurchases of 4.5 to $5 billion. That if you look at what our year-to-date net income is and that certainly doesn't equate to a picture for the year of 4.5 to 5 billion.", "Those two numbers are long that are showing that we are taking capital out of this.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay so I guess to push one more level on that then is so therefore the payout can sustainably be ahead of net income for the foreseeable future?", "Jay Benet", "You get to a point where you have taken out the excess capital so you eventually get to a steady state where the payout is going to be based up on what is your net income, what are your capital needs in the company and what are your various targets for holding company and liquidity and debt and everything else.", "So, eventually you do get to (inaudible).", "Jay Fishman", "", "We have talked previously as you all know that we are going to stop the practice and giving guidance when we get to next year but one of the things I think that we probably do have to provide some continuing visibility on this projected share repurchases because to exactly your point you really can't independently make an assessment of what our capital position is and what's available.", "So my guess is as that when we get to the fourth quarter and we got our plans and budgets all squared away for next year. We really are not going to speak to EPS but we will give you a robust understanding of what our capital management plans are?", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great that's helpful. Thanks. The other one on capital management is just a dividend policy, could you just remind us how probably set that because the dollars allocated to dividend obviously have been flat for a while, while the share counts gone down.", "So just how do you think about that going forward?", "Jay Benet", "I will look at it historically whatever you are comfortable on.", "Jay Fishman", "I mean if we take a look at what the dividend yields are for comparable companies and the property causality space. We look at payout ratios and we recognized that we are in a business where the wind blows and the earth shakes. We take that into account in the past and what we have been fortunate enough to be able to do over the last couple of years is look at well we have a very solid earnings stream and we have paid out roughly $700 million if you look at the dollar amount in each one of the years. You are absolutely right our share count has gone down as a result of the repurchases. So we have been increasing the dividend to bring the dollar payout roughly back up to the same level which has basically kept the payout ratio and the yields very competitive.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Totally shifting gears from capital management, can you comment at all on the workers comp pricing environment, we are hearing stuff out of Florida and others. What are you seeing at the margin there?", "Brian MacLean", "", "Yeah sure this is Brian and if you look at our numbers you will see that we have been growing our workers comp and it's actually that we are growing it for about 10 years. We have been growing it fairly gradually. In the aggregate for our book we feel very good and while the economy is clearly impacted the exposures and pay roll changes and some places have been dramatic. We have been adding accounts and seeing some moderate growth in the line.", "The bottom line is Tom maybe more than any other products we do is a state-by-state industry-by-industry, account size-by- account size kind of dynamic. So we look at a very granular level and really believe it's the classic risk selection gain and feel good about it. One thing I would comment on and maybe I'll throw to Bill Cunningham is the AM best data on comps have a good bit of play and that's just a slice of the industry and you need to understand what it is that's looking at.", "Bill Cunningham", "That study of the price referencing was a composite of the state fund business and the mono line workers comp market business and as you look at that, many of those state funds are markets of less resort and obviously as we talk about selection and the things that we have in place. Selection is not possible when it's a market of last resort and the pricing is not always appropriate. So as we look at the profile of our book and our results are much different than that.", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah and so Greg we would agree that there are certain states and certain industries where we'd be very concerned with comp and be pulling back but in the act that we feel good about our book.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, are rates at the margin, is pricing going up or down for that line?", "Jeff Fishman", "Again it's a state by state and for competitive reasons we aren't going to get into state specific. So we'd say on an overall basis our workers comp pricing has been fairly consistent with the approach we've been taking over the last few quarters. We have not seen a dramatic change.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "No shift. Okay. Okay. Last one from me on direct cost.", "Gabriella Nawi", "What is it Greg?", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Just on direct auto, just because there is a lot of money that's being spent in that direction, just so I understand, you're pricing that business the same to both agents are you are to the direct customers. So there is no benefit for going direct to the travelers at this point, to the customer?", "Jeff Fishman", "Relative to the agent. They get the same price whether they go to the agent or they come direct. It's the only pricing track we have. We don't have one -- we have no experience in the direct channel. So we don't have an ability to create a pricing track yet based on experience.", "Greg Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, I'll follow-up with that more offline. Thanks guys.", "Gabriella Nawi", "And we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of John Hall from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed.", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "Great, thanks very much. I have only two questions. I'll give them straight up. The first one has to do with whether you're utilizing any enhanced commission structure as you go after any new business, whether that's part of your program on a commercial line side and the second one has to do with the comment that Brian made. You talked about the economy or if and the when the economy providing it having a very positive effect on exposure and potentially premium trends. I was wondering if that notion is factoring into your retention strategy and how so.", "Brian MacLean", "So first on the commission side, nothing unusual. We pay base commissions and we pay supplemental\u2026", "Jeff Fishman", "We don't have any -- we don't have any specials on with respect to growing or anything else. [Multiple Speakers]", "Brian MacLean", "Our fundamental programs there over the last several years have remained very constant both in structure and in amount.", "Jeff Fishman", "We will obviously shoot predominantly our fixed value based commission to differentiate one producer, one agency versus another, those that grow more will have a higher fixed value based supplement than others but there's nothing special on with respect to growing this month or anything like that.", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. So you're not utilizing any of the platform savings you talked about in that direction?", "Jay Fishman", "", "In small commercial I don't think they have changed the commission structure as expressed. Did we put it out? We did for a little maybe years ago but not currently.", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay great.", "Jay Fishman", "And the second question?", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "On the economy and.", "Jay Fishman", "It's been an interesting phenomenon that we speak about a lot and we talked about it for literally years that the renewed market has had a remarkable stability to it that actually is consisted with those of who us who are in the business in the 90s it's fairly. There is a robust competitive environment for new business but yet the renewed book seems to be and this is universal by the way. It's just not us if you look at any carrier, maybe quality carrier. You speak to agents, you speak to brokers they will all comment and the ones we speak to will observe that the renewal market has a remarkable stability, our customers are just happy. Most customers are happy just staying where they are and the fact is as long as the premium doesn't go up there they are happy with the broker, they are happy with the carrier and the experience is good and the business is just suppose is there.", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "And on the exposure change if your comment is getting at is there anything, let me answer it directly. There is nothing explicitly in how we are evaluating business or pricing business that contemplates a growth and exposure and therefore a different profitability dynamic on the account going forward.", "Obviously we think about in these and we are hopeful in these conditions that if you got a account and you feel comfortable with them today as the economy expense is going to get bigger and that will be a better thing.", "But we are not building it into the economics of how we are viewing the trade.", "Brian MacLean", "", "And the notion in today's environment I am sure like most of your employers the ability \u2013 the willingness of your employers to take on added costs that aren't justified with underlying activity is a substance of issue for every business and it's a substance of issue for our customers.", "It's not particularly easy nor well received. If you go to a customer with \u2013 getting through a challenging economic environment and suggest that we raise the price for insurance. So our retention strategy is molded by the environment we are in that the economic environment we are in and the realization that there are real life customers on the other side of the transaction and you got to be responsive to the overall economic environment and manage the business for the long term and that really defines the approach.", "John Hall - Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. That answers the question. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Ms. Nawi I will now turn the call back to you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "", "Well thank you all for listening and if you do have any follow-up questions please contact myself or Andrew Hersom in the Investor Relations Department. Thank you very much and have a good day.", "Operator", "", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

(Operator Instructions) At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Michael Connelly, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Michael Connelly", "Morning and welcome to The Travelers discussion of fourth quarter and full year 2007 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section. Today with me is Jay Fishman, CEO, Jay Benet, CFO, Brian McLean, Chief Operating Officer, Joseph Lacher, head of our Personal and Select businesses and Tom Kunkel, President of Bond and Financial Products, as well as other members of senior management.", "They will discuss the financial results of our business in the current market environment and they will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. Due to the number of topics we plan to cover in our prepared remarks we will run past our normal one hour but will still leave 30 minutes for Q&A.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements specifically earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectation due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements and other materials that are available in the Investor section of our website, www.travelers.com. With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you Mike and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re very pleased with our company\u2019s performance in the fourth quarter and for the entire year. On the bottom line for the full year we posted operating income of $4.5 billion or $6.71 per diluted share with a strong operating return on equity of nearly 18%. Operating income per share increased nearly 14% over 2006. On the top line net written premiums increased 3% adjusted for the sales of Afianzadora Insurgentes and Mendota. We are pleased with this result particularly given the somewhat more competitive marketplace we faced this year. With disciplined underwriting we\u2019ve been able to grow our business profitably and that\u2019s what we will strive for again in 2008. Each of our business segments contributed to the $1.1 billion of operating income that we earned in the fourth quarter. Retentions remain and are at historically high levels and margins continue to remain strong as evidenced by our fourth quarter and full year overall combined ratios of 88.4% and 87.4% respectively.", "In keeping with our commitment to active capital management in the fourth quarter we repurchased $1 billion of our company\u2019s stock to bring the total amount we purchased to $4.1 billion since inception of the program in the second quarter of 2006. The Board of Directors has approved an additional $5 billion of common share repurchases bring the total remaining authorization to just under $6 billion. The company remains very well capitalized and highly liquid and our balance sheet is strong. We\u2019re well positioned for the marketplace ahead.", "This morning we\u2019re broadening our call to provide insight and transparency into a number of issues that may be of investor interest particularly given recent events. We\u2019ve covered our residential sub-prime exposure previously and we will update that but we\u2019re also going to provide insight into our commercial mortgage-backed securities position and our real estate owned portfolio. We\u2019re going to discuss our Directors and Officers and errors and omissions exposure to the sub-prime environment generally as this has received some attention in the press over the last few weeks. We\u2019re also going to cover our subdivision surety bond position and update you on that portfolio. In all of these areas we are pleased and comfortable with our position and will share with you our analysis of these various exposures. We think you\u2019ll be pleased with the transparency and candor of the analysis as well as the conclusions we\u2019ve reached. To make sure we cover everything Jay, Brian and Joe are going to go through the customary materials somewhat more quickly than we have in the past. From an underwriting perspective the fourth quarter was not much different from the third and we don\u2019t anticipate a meaningful change in our marketplace strategy for 2008. We do expect that the investment environment will be somewhat more challenging. Nonetheless that is all factored into the 2008 guidance we provided in our press release and Jay will have more to say about that later. With that let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. Page three of the webcast summarizes our fourth quarter and full year financial performance, net earned premiums increased by 2% quarter over quarter and by 3% year over year. Fourth quarter operating income exceeded $1 billion for the sixth quarter in a row and full year operating income climbed to $4.5 billion, an increase of 7% from an already highly profitable 2006. Importantly notwithstanding the very challenging investment environment that has recently hurt many banks and other large financial institutions our investment portfolio performed very well for both the quarter and the full year and it remains very healthy and well positioned. I\u2019ll speak to NII and certain components of our investment portfolio in a few minutes but I wanted to specifically point out the $6 million of after tax net realized investment gains for the quarter and the $101 million after tax net realized investment gains for the full year. These net realized investment gains include impairments of only $38 million pre tax for the fourth quarter and $70 million pre tax for the entire year. These low levels of impairments truly speak to the high quality of our portfolio. ", "Our weighted average diluted share count of 649 million has dropped significantly due to our share repurchase activity. We repurchased 19 million common shares in the fourth quarter at a total cost of $1 billion bringing full year share repurchases to 8.3% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the year. And since the second quarter 2006 inception of this program we\u2019ve purchased 78.8 million shares at a total cost of $4.1 billion representing 11.3% of the outstanding shares as of the beginning of that period. Given our strong operating performance and financial position we expect to complete the current $5 billion share repurchase program near the end of the first quarter of 2008 although as always we will modify our repurchase activity based upon current market conditions. And as Jay already mentioned our Board has approved an additional $5 billion multi year program under which share repurchases are expected to begin immediately after completing the current program.", "The information on page four speaks to many of the reasons why we feel so good about our company. Let me start by saying that our balance sheet is in terrific shape. We ended the year with almost $26 billion of common equity ex FAS 115 up 5% since the beginning of the year and book value per share ex FAS 115 up $41.23 up 14% since the beginning of the year each after $2.9 billion of share repurchases and $738 million of common stock dividends. Our capital is at or above target levels for our regulators and rating agencies and we have no current need to add to our capital base other than for normal growth which we are self-funding. We are currently under review for possible upgrade from Moody\u2019s, from whom our claim spending rating is already at an AA3 and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital. ", "Our debt to capital ratio of 19.4$ favorably compares to its 20% target and with a very low level of debt maturing in 2008 and 2009 coupled with our very strong liquidity we have the ability to self-fund all of these maturities placing us in the enviable position of being able to refinance debt in the capital markets if and when we believe market conditions are favorable. Our holding company liquidity of $1.6 billion significantly exceeds our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends by $500 million and we are not reliant on commercial paper for funding or liquidity needs. Our investment portfolio had a pre tax on realized gain of $937 million at year end 2007 and we have determined that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes from municipal bonds insurers. We\u2019ve closely examined our exposures to sub-prime Alt-A mortgages as well as to commercial mortgage-back securities and SIV related assets and found each of them to be negligible and the rest of our real estate portfolio is well diversified and appropriately valued. ", "Lastly while not on this slide, I\u2019d also like to point out that our insurance reserves have continued to develop favorably as we have had net favorable prior year reserve development in each of the last eight quarters. The data provided on page five highlights several items that are contained within our consolidated operating income and GAAP combined ratios. I will make just a few comments here. Net favorable prior year reserve development was $83 million after tax in the current quarter and we made no adjustments to our asbestos or environmental reserves other than for payment activity. Current quarter catastrophe losses of $45 million mostly resulted from wild fires in California and we also experienced a favorable revision to our loss ratio estimates for the current accident year resulting in a $35 million after tax benefit in the current quarter. With that I\u2019d like to now turn the microphone over to Brian McLean.", "Brian McLean", "Thanks Jay. I\u2019ll start on slide six and talk a little about the marketplace, go through the segment results for our commercial businesses and then offer some specific comments on our sub-prime exposure generally.", "Our commercial businesses performed very well this quarter and for that matter throughout 2007. The fundamentals of our business are very strong; margins remain strong and are consistently solid across all our markets. The renewal book has performed exceptionally well with very high retention and in general modest price declines. The new business environment has been somewhat more competitive particularly in the fourth quarter so even though we saw some softening our performance was extremely favorable. Looking at the details on slide seven you can see that retentions are very high across all the businesses, they\u2019ve been consistently strong and we had improved retentions across the board in the quarter. These levels reflect our strategy to leverage our excellent margins and keep the profitable business we have on our books. We believe these high retentions clearly reflect the value of our franchise to our agents and our customers and have not been attained at the expense of meaningful rate accommodations. This is clear from the pure rate change on the renewal book which shows a modest decline. Comparing rate change in the fourth quarter 2007 with fourth quarter 2006 you see that Select, our small commercial business has experience only a 2 point rate change. In addition commercial accounts has seen a 2 point rate change and remained consistent with last quarter.", "In our international and financial products businesses pure rate has come down but gradually. In all you can see a gradual decline in pure rate change over the past several quarters with the biggest declines being in larger account markets.", "On slide eight we show total renewal price change which reflects both the rate and exposure change. RPC can be more erratic due to these exposure movements but as you see our experience over the past eight quarters has been generally consistent with the pure rate trends. New business dollars are also shown on slide eight and you can see that overall 2007 was a very strong year. In almost all markets new business submissions were up dramatically from 2006, a result of the initiatives we\u2019ve discussed in previous calls including express and express plus and select and the new products offered to our industry edge initiatives. In the fourth quarter we were still seeing good flow but the number of new accounts we actually wrote as a percentage of quotes, our hit ratio, while steady through 2006 and 2007 moved down slightly in the quarter. This decline in hit ratio indicates a more competitive marketplace for new business with pricing some times at levels lower than we are willing to go. Even with this competitive environment new business pricing on the deals we did write, remain at acceptable levels and for the full year 2007 showed strong performance, with a total of $2.8 billion written in these markets.", "Turning to slide nine, business insurance turns in a great performance with a 4% increase in operating income in the quarter and a 15% increase for the full year. The combined ratios for both the quarter and full year were 87.8, an improvement of 3.1 points from 2006. Severity was benign this quarter again in the lower single-digits continuing the trend seen in previous quarters. As we outlined in last quarter\u2019s call frequency while continuing to decline slightly is leveling off. This quarter\u2019s results have demonstrated a continuation of that moderate trend again still within a favorable range. When we adjust our combined ratio for net favorable prior year development business insurance had a terrific full year result at 91.1 consistent with 2006. ", "Turning to slide 10 you see that net written premium is down 2% in business insurance this quarter due to our disciplined underwriting in the new business environment we discussed. If you look at the full year most of the markets were up year over year resulting in a 2% improvement again driven largely by the strong retention and the impact of our initiatives in products and analytics. ", "Looking at slide 11 the financial, professional and international insurance segment continued to produce positive results with operating income of 5% from the same quarter last year, full year results showed an 11% increase. The combined ratio improved 5.1 points quarter over quarter and for the full year it was 87.6 a strong result again improved over 2006. The lower portion of the slide shows net written premiums up 2% for the quarter and 4% for the full year. In bond and financial products growth in our surety business was offset by declines in management liability products. Underlying the growth in surety is our high retention of existing accounts, solid flow of new business and a credit profile that continues to get stronger. The international operations premium increase was favorably impacted by foreign exchange rates as well as solid growth in our Lloyds and Canadian businesses. We are pleased that even after adjusting for net favorable prior year development the FPII segment combined ratio for 2007 was 90.6 versus 89.4 in \u201906. In a minute I will provide comments specific to our management liability book and sub-prime environment but want to emphasize here that even after taking into account the impact of any losses or all the losses from these issues, this business continues to perform at very profitable levels.", "Overall in this quarter our commercial insurance businesses produced great results. The fundamentals of our business are solid, retention of our profitable book is strong and margins remain excellent. We recognize and increasingly competitive marketplace and certain underlying economic pressures however we\u2019re maintaining our focus on growth albeit in a disciplined manner and that discipline produced another terrific quarter.", "Now I\u2019m going to take a few minutes to talk about our management liability book of business and how we evaluate potential exposure to the sub-prime environment. On slide 12 we\u2019ve shown our management liability premium for 2007 and broken out the portion of this book by product that we estimate is exposed to this issue. You can see that we have $1.6 billion of management liability premium and have separated it into four product groups; directors and officers, fiduciary, errors and omissions and all other products. The other category contains a variety of products that are footnoted at the bottom of the page and would not directly respond to the issues created by sub-prime. In the three exposed product groups the percentage of our book that we estimate is exposed to sub-prime is relatively small primarily due to the diverse nature of the book. For example, approximately 4% of the total book is with private and non-profit accounts with negligible exposure to this issue. Additionally, we have a very industry diverse book and specifically our market position in the financial services industry is led by our community bank portfolio. These are smaller banks which so far have not been associated with the sub-prime issues and we don\u2019t currently anticipate that as a class they will. Our portfolio is not heavily weighted to larger, public company financial institutions or money center and investment banks. Overall our total exposed management liability products are less than 1% of our total company premium. ", "Turning to slide 13 it\u2019s important to consider specific characteristics of these products and our approach to underwriting. D&O, E&O and fiduciary products are issued on claims made policies which dramatically reduce the latency tail on the business and the ability to stack limits. Very importantly policy limits are low, between $5 million and $25 million and are weighted more heavily towards excess coverage than primary with relatively high attachment points. Specifically for the exposed D&O policies our average limit is about $8 million and 70% of the premium is excess. On these excess accounts we typically attach it over $50 million which is very important when you consider the defense costs due to this issue could be considerable. We also have a reinsurance program that further limits our exposure. On a policy level basis we see it approximately two-thirds above a $5 million retention which reduces our net exposure per loss to $12 million up to an annual aggregate of approximately $375 million. In addition we\u2019ve been proactively taking into account the sub-prime pressures throughout much of 2007 incorporating the environment into our underwriting. So considering our diverse book and the way we\u2019ve approached the market you can see that we have acted to restrict our exposure and we expect that any potential issue would be a frequency not a severity one. ", "If you turn to slide 14 I\u2019d like to walk you through the detailed analysis we performed to determine our potential exposure to sub-prime claims. For starters we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts that we felt had an elevated level of exposure. The definition of what was elevated obviously began with accounts that had current reported claims or notices and I\u2019ll speak directly to them in a moment. Second we identified and individually analyzed accounts for which we had not received a claim or notice but which we determined to have a heightened risk of loss. This group was broad and included large financial institutions, sub-prime lenders, bond insurers, home builders and suppliers, as well as related accounts we saw mentioned in major financial press. For this analysis we reviewed each individual account from an actuarial claim and underwriting point of view. Our team factored in relevant circumstances of each account with particular attention to the structure of the coverage including limits and attachment points, as well as reinsurance. The result is an account by account estimate of ultimate gross and net liability. Third we performed an aggregate analysis to estimate losses not identified in the individual account analysis. In this portion of our portfolio which included accounts such as community banks, we conducted an actuarially based frequency and severity reserve analysis to understand our level of exposure. The net result of this entire process was a robust review of loss pertaining to sub-prime events for this market. ", "On slide 15 we provide some data from this analysis specifically regarding claims and notices as of December 31, 2007. As of the close of \u201907 we had 30 sub-prime related management liability claims. You can see in the charts that we were primary on five and excess on 25 of these policies which again is typical of our approach within the large financial institutions marketplace. As I mentioned, in general limits ranged between $5 million and $25 million and you see the average related to these claims is $11 million. Limits management is an active part of our liability underwriting strategy. So overall a limited number of claims and consistent with our overall profile. We have fully recognized these claims in our 2007 earnings results and the overall provisions in the 2007 financial statements and the 2008 guidance incorporates the results of the analysis we conducted. The estimate for sub-prime losses in 2008 guidance is not materially different from the estimated losses for 2007. After considering all of the above actions our management liability business continues to meet our return thresholds. ", "Our project is based on what we believe to be a realistic assessment of our exposure to the sub-prime environment but you could obviously ask could it be worse. Given that we view this as fundamentally a frequency issue, we think a material variance from our assessment would require systemic changes to the insured litigation environment expanding our exposure to segments that currently appear to have low correlation to the sub-prime environment. ", "Finally let me round out the conversation on our bond and management liability business by touching on our surety segment, specifically about potential exposure to residential real estate developers. Slide 16 and 17 speak to subdivision bonds which as you know provide coverage to real estate developers in the event of a financial or operational failure prevents the developer from installing improvements guaranteed by the bond. These typically include sewer, roads and sidewalks. We generally do not provide performance bonds guaranteeing the construction of individual homes. Our construction surety business is comprised largely of infrastructure and public work projects and importantly only 1% of our construction surety accounts are subdivision programs. During the past quarter we took a very close look at the potential for subdivision exposures. We have scrutinized the portfolio and evaluated the financial condition of many of our insured\u2019s, the extent to which the credits are secured and the general progress towards completion of the obligations. We then applied a series of stress scenarios assuming market conditions worse than we currently anticipate. This analysis which is outlined on slide 17 concludes that under scenarios worse than we currently anticipate we wouldn\u2019t expect losses over time to exceed approximately $100 million. ", "In summary we have thought in a comprehensive fashion about the evolving implications of financial sector stress on our management liability and surety industry exposures. The net conclusion of our in depth exposure analysis at year end 2007 are that the issues are very manageable for us and we\u2019re comfortable by both our diversity and profitability of business in the management liability and surety lines.", "Now before I turn it over to Joe for personal lines, I\u2019d like to address one more topic relating to this. Recently we\u2019ve gotten the question about how a recession would impact our security book so I\u2019d like to turn it over to Tom Kunkel who runs our bond and financial professional liability businesses to give you our response.", "Tom Kunkel", "Thank you Brian. That is a legitimate question so here\u2019s some perspective on our surety portfolio. Seventy-five percent of our surety premium is actually in our construction surety business. Within that construction surety industry we are seeing some slow down in the amount of privately funded construction projects. But it\u2019s important to realize that we estimate that 90% of our construction portfolio is driven by public work spending, for example, Federal, state and local funding for building and infrastructure projects. The level of public work funding is currently historically robust. We write some of the best capitalized contractors in their class and the condition of their balance sheets as well as the condition of the back log of uncompleted work continues to look very strong. And lastly it\u2019s important to realize that in the event of a contractor default, we typically do have the right to the owner\u2019s unpaid contract balance, thus mitigating our exposure under the bond. For these reasons we feel very good about the profitability in this construction surety book. We feel equally strongly about our commercial surety portfolio. Commercial surety makes up approximately 25% of our overall surety premium. Again the credit quality and underlying financial strength of this portfolio is very strong. This book is well secured and where appropriate it is collateralized. It\u2019s a very diverse portfolio and we pay very close attention to managing the underlying makeup of the individual obligations that we assume. So again, while these are very legitimate questions we feel very good about the profitability of our surety portfolio. Joe?", "Joseph Lacher ", "Thanks Tom. Looking at slide 18 personal insurance segment had another terrific quarter with a combined ratio of 91% in $201 million in operating earnings. It continued to deliver strong retention, renewal pricing and year over year PIP growth, both the auto and homeowners line. As you look at profitability there are several items affecting the comparability of results I\u2019d like to discuss to make the underlying results are clear. Our reported combined ratio was 12.7 points worse than the fourth quarter 2006. Adjusting for lower levels of favorable prior year reserve development and current year loss ratio re-estimation and for higher levels of catastrophe losses the difference was only a modest deterioration of 1.4 points of combined ratio. ", "Looking to production results on page 19 let me talk first about homeowners business. Here we continue to produce strong results despite the declines in housing sales. We\u2019ve maintained a stable retention rate of 86%, renewal price change at 8% was in line with what we\u2019ve seen in the last four quarters. Policies in force increased by 3% versus the prior year quarter. We\u2019ve been pleased with the reception and the early sales of Quantum Home in the market. Quantum Home offers industry leading product sophistication enabling us to continue to deliver profitable growth. Over the last quarter the program was implemented in six additional markets bringing our total to date to 31 states plus the District of Columbia. We\u2019re on track to roll out the remaining targeted states during 2008. We\u2019re also very pleased with the production results of our auto business. Excluding the impact of the Mendota sale net written premium and policies in force both grew 1% over the prior year quarter. Retention remained strong and stable at 83% and RPC was plus 2%. Quantum Auto now represents over a third of our country wide annualized written premium. This was the first full quarter in which Quantum Auto was available in New York which represents the final planned launch in our Quantum Auto roll out. ", "Page 20 shows our combined ratios for auto and homeowners. As I mentioned before several items impacting comparability need to be considered when looking at results across periods. There are three principal items. First combined ratios in the fourth quarter 2006 benefited from significantly greater favorable prior year reserve development and the re-estimation of the current year loss ratios. Second results in 2007 had significantly greater catastrophe losses than in 2006. Third there is typically a quarterly seasonality impact in auto loss ratios with the fourth quarter being the highest quarter. This results largely from weather and usage differentials. When looking at the seasonality impact the fourth quarter 2006 results were somewhat better than typical and the fourth quarter 2007 were somewhat worse. Thus when comparing the results, the bulk of the difference in combined ratios between fourth quarter 2006 and 2007 were attributable to these three items. When comparing the auto combined ratio for sequential quarters, the bulk of the difference is attributable to the seasonality issue.", "Please recall that renewal price changes were plus 2% for auto and plus 8% for homeowners. Clearly price reductions were not driving combined ratio changes. Let me try to wrap this all together. Although not displayed here as you look at the full year 2007 result excluding the impact of prior year reserve development and catastrophes the combined ratios for both auto and homeowners were within half a point of the prior year. This underscores that underlying results were generally consistent period over period.", "Turning to page 21 I\u2019d like to spend a few moments on auto loss trends. On the far right side you can see that we\u2019re seeing total loss trend in the low to mid single-digit range excluding the impact of the Quantum Auto introduction. Looking underneath this result, frequency trend drives the total loss trend. Severity is down slightly overall, this is a combination of a modest increase in physical damage severity trends and a decrease in bodily injury severity trend. I know that our bodily injury results are counter to what a number of our competitors have been disclosing; we attribute this to the continued impact of our claim initiatives on these coverages. As we flip to page 22 I\u2019d like to spend a moment on Quantum Auto\u2019s anticipated impact on our frequency.", "The product\u2019s broader reach to more standard drivers anticipated an increase in overall absolute frequency. Our pricing appropriately reflects this change. When we look at the chart on the left the red line shows the expected impact on the overall books frequency from Quantum. The blue line shows the actual results are generally in line with our expectations. Again we remain pleased with our results from Quantum Auto and the overall program is performing consistently with our expectations. ", "Wrapping it all together, we\u2019ve had another great quarter and year and look forward to carrying our success into 2008. With that I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Joe, the chart on page 23 average invested assets grew to $75.2 billion in the quarter increasing over 3% when compared to the prior year quarter. Operating cash flows were approximately $1.4 billion in the current quarter and over $5.3 billion year to date. The average quality rating of our fixed maturity investment portfolio remains very strong at AA1 or AA+. The low investment grade securities comprise only 2.5% of the portfolio and the duration of the portfolio remained at 4. Our fourth quarter net investment income is shown on page 24 with $696 million after tax reflecting lower yields on non fixed income investments than in recent quarters. NII for the affixed income portfolio benefited from the increased invested asset basis as well as higher reinvestment rates. Overall our after tax yield was 3.7% for the quarter. In our continuing effort to be highly transparent and responsive to our investors and the analyst community we\u2019re providing detailed information about certain portions of our investment portfolio. Last week we provided detailed information about our municipal bond holdings in a Form 8-K filing and as the data indicated we estimated that the average credit rating of the portfolio would be AA+ without any of the benefits from the insurance [wrappers] as compared to an approximate AAA- including the [wrappers] due to the very strong underlying ratings of the issuers of these bonds. ", "We\u2019ve concluded that we have immaterial exposure to ratings changes for municipal bond insurers and for your convenience, we\u2019ve reproduced the schedules contained in that 8-K as an appendix to this webcast.", "Page 25 provides an update to our exposure to sub-prime and Alt-A mortgages while pages 26 and 27 which are new, provide information about all other of our real estate related holdings. Our exposure to sub-prime Alt-A mortgages remains negligible, the only change of any consequence in the quarter was that we selectively took advantage of favorable pricing to add modestly to our position increasing our total sub-prime Alt-A mortgages to $286 million or .4% of the fixed maturity portfolio at the end of the fourth quarter from $192 million or .3% at the end of the third quarter. ", "Our exposure to commercial mortgage-back securities is also negligible. As the data on page 26 indicates we held only $607 million of non-agency US CMBSs at year end representing less than 1% of our fixed maturity portfolio and having an average credit rating of AAA and all of these investments were acquired in 2004 and prior, well before recent increases in commercial real estate values.", "On page 27 we show certain information for our remaining real estate related holdings. This is a highly diverse portfolio and recent appraisals for holding on properties and joint ventures are well in excess of current carrying value. Here too we feel very comfortable with our investments and their carrying values. ", "The common theme in all of this is a highly disciplined approach to investing. Recognizing that as a company we take most of our risk on the liability side of the balance sheet and making sure that on the investment side we are appropriately compensated for the risks that we do take. ", "Pages 28 and 29 provide information about our guidance for full year 2008. We expect fully diluted operating income per share to be in the range of $5.40 to $5.75 generating an operating return on equity of approximately 13% to 14%. Based upon expected market conditions we are anticipation somewhat lower NII due to a more challenging investment environment particularly for non fixed income investments and a 1% increase in our underlying combined ratio due to a continuation of the somewhat more competitive underwriting environment. Our guidance assumes full year catastrophe losses of $525 million pre tax and $340 million after tax or $0.55 per share after tax which represents the average annual loss expectancy as indicated by our [cat] modeling. No prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable, growth in average invested assets in the low single-digits after approximately $2.7 billion of share repurchases and weighted average diluted shares of approximately $618 million after share repurchases and employee equity awards.", "Finally on page 29 we have provided certain information that should help you understand the major differences between actual operating income per diluted share in 2007 and our 2008 guidance. With that let me turn the microphone back to Jay for his closing remarks before we do Q&A.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you Jay. First we apologize for the length this morning but thought it was very important to go through these various topics and before we open it up for questions let me just make a couple of closing observations. ", "First we\u2019ve got very good positive momentum as we head into 2008 and we\u2019re optimistic about our performance. Second we\u2019re pleased with the results of the analysis that we shared with you this morning and believe that it speaks well to our size, the diversity of our business and the smart, disciplined approach that we take to underwriting and to investing. We plan on running our business with that same focus as we look to the future and with that we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Thanks and good morning and I just wanted to say thanks again for all the increased disclosure on the sub-prime and the surety I think that helps. If I could come at that issue from another angle based on your current expectations for the sub-prime D&O and E&O and surety related components if you look back to where say we were in 2001, 2002 with the melt down in the NASDAC and [Rona WorldCom] what were your initial expectations in terms D&O and E&O related losses then versus the ultimate result. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of how bad it could get relative to your expectations and then in addition to that if you could give us a sense of how high your surety combined ratio can go in a recession-type environment. I think that would be helpful for a historical perspective.", "Jay Fishman", "Well Jay let me start with making an observation about our expectations with respect to D&O and E&O, the management liability losses. You\u2019ve been in this industry long enough to understand that we actually write insurance and expect to have claims. And that we anticipate a level of claims in the business and we price the business accordingly. One way to think about the management liability exposure anticipated losses that we see, or anticipate at the moment, is that it\u2019s envisioned, incorporated, accommodated by if you like, the loss ratio that we would ordinarily peg against this business. We don\u2019t make an assumption that any business that we write is going to be loss-free. We make an ongoing assumption that there will be claims and there will be losses and at least there isn\u2019t anything yet in the management liability arena that would cause us to believe that there would be a dramatic difference between the ongoing expected loss performance and what we see coming out of this which is why we make the comment that says that we continue to view these businesses as operating within the return thresholds that we set. We\u2019ve spoken earlier on Investor Days about having return thresholds in our business of from 13% to 18% depending upon the business itself and even after giving affect to expected losses in this business we continue to view the returns in the business being in those ranges. So I\u2019ve got to start with the premise that says after a detailed account by account analysis it looks to us as though the expected losses will fall within the expected range of losses that we would have for this business. That may change. It may be different because of a systemic difference in the kinds of losses that come at us, but again as Brian mentioned before, it\u2019s frequency not severity. ", "I\u2019m looking at Tom, I don\u2019t know how to go back to 2001 and comment on expectations versus actually kind of on-the-run here. ", "Tom Kunkel", "Yeah, on the run it\u2019s a very difficult question to answer Jay. I share you sentiments on that. ", "Jay Fishman", "The second question I think Jay that you asked was about the surety business and I think you asked about\u2026and I\u2019m not sure whether your question is specific to the subdivision environment or the surety business more generally. First in the subdivision environment the stress test that we provided in this webcast does I think exactly as you asked us to do which is we\u2019ve assumed only those accounts that are of the strongest quality either because of their strength or their collateral position, would in affect be money good, and we\u2019ve assumed that 33% of all of the remaining accounts default and have zero recovery associated with them. That would be an awfully bad environment. Yeah I\u2019m assuming it could probably we worse but in our experience that would be, I suspect on precedence in terms of loss experience in that book, and even in that highly remote scenario we\u2019re talking about cumulative net losses which would evolve over obviously a number of years of less than $100 million and in the context of the business that\u2019s just reporting $4.5 billion in earnings, I just don\u2019t see that as anything particularly problematic when you view it as a stress case scenario. ", "If you look more broadly at the surety business and again going back to Tom\u2019s comments, 75% of the surety business is construction-based, 90% of it in public works projects. Importantly look at the customers that we\u2019ve been engaged with in that business and remember in the end that we have rights to the remaining contract proceeds in the unlikely event that a contractor defaults. That has happened, it certainly has happened in our book and to others as well, but fundamentally the project is collateralized by the remaining proceeds due from the municipality or the state government. So our view of looking at the construction side of the business remains pretty confident and wouldn\u2019t envision a dramatic change in losses from sort of historical experience. The commercial side is carefully underwritten. We focus on collateral and security and yeah, you know you tell me the economic environment or the level of distress that you want to place at it and sure I think losses would tick up, but again in the context of a company our size I don\u2019t think that they would become problematic. I know I\u2019m not answering your question with a level of specificity that you\u2019d like but it\u2019s virtually impossible to do so. Anything Tom that you want to add?", "Tom Kunkel", "I would just add that our experience in this business shows us that recessions in and of them selves don\u2019t necessarily cause surety losses. But they do tend to expose the underwriting that took place when times were good, when the economy goes into a recession and I think our position on that is that even in robust economic times our underwriting has not changed and so in a recession it\u2019s not necessarily going to follow that our losses will increase.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "I appreciate that and then just a separate one for Jay Benet, on the investment portfolio, for the other investments, I know I\u2019ve asked this question before but what do you think is the right run rate or right investment yields for the other investments so we can model that?", "Jay Benet", "Yeah in the past what I\u2019ve said you know given some steadiness in the marketplace, the quarterly analysis show ups and downs but we would generally advise averaging the quarters. I would say at this point in time, given the way the markets are at least for our planning purposes, we think the fourth quarter of \u201907 is more indicative again for planning purposes, of what we would look for going forward into \u201908. ", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Do you tend to get an up tick on that in the first quarter though seasonally?", "Jay Benet", "I\u2019m sorry could you repeat that?", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Lehman Brothers", "Is there seasonality in that result, in the quarterly result, does the first quarter tend to be stronger than say the fourth?", "William Heyman", "In typical times there some seasonality in distributions by private equity funds. I think we\u2019re in a climate right now in which that is not the case and not likely to be the case for a while. Also in December private equity funds often make distributions before year end. ", "That was not the case this December.  So I think for the moment we have to take a somewhat longer term view of the portfolio, which we think as a matter of risk thresholds ought to perform over time much as public equities perform, possibly plus or minus a few points.", "Jay Fishman", "I think the other point, Jay, that I would add and Jay Benet did mention this but simply to reiterate it is that our guidance for 2008 assumes a somewhat lower level of net investment income than we actually realized in 2007, driven really uniquely by what we perceive to be the potential for a more challenging realization environment in the investment arena.  ", "It\u2019s not attributable to cash flows or anything else.  It\u2019s purely an issue of perceiving the realization environment to be somewhat more challenging and then the rest of the guidance is accounted for by about 100 basis points change in the ongoing run rate of the combined ratio simply to incorporate the continuation of the more competitive environment that we\u2019ve been witnessing.  ", "We are assuming for \u201808 that that environment will continue to look very much like the change in \u201807 looked; that it will get increasingly somewhat more competitive as \u201808 moves along.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley.  ", "Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley ", "Back to management liability; Brian, in your prepared remarks you rhetorically questioned, how could it be worse?  You mentioned that it would be more likely frequency driven than severity.  Then you went on  -- and I think Jay Fishman, you also used the word systemic, there would have to be a systemic change in the litigation environment, presumably entities that you\u2019re not currently contemplating brought into this mess.  Could you expand on that some?", "Jay Fishman ", "I think your characterization is actually quite right.  We, for example, do not currently see -- this isn\u2019t a conclusion that we\u2019re reaching, these are facts -- we don\u2019t currently see the small local community bank being dragged into the sub-prime issue.

When we refer to a systemic change, we\u2019re really talking about a class of risk not currently identified in any way, not currently associated with it in some way being dragged into it.  ", "Brian\u2019s comment about frequency versus severity is driven by our limits profile.  We have low limits, relatively small limits I think compared to other people who underwrite the business, and so an individual account won\u2019t change much of anything.  It would actually take a systemic change in the class of business that was associated with this and for there to be litigation which our policies would respond to.

So that\u2019s what we think could trigger a worst case scenario, but so far there\u2019s no evidence of that.", "Bill Wilt - Morgan Stanley ", "Are you currently contemplating defense coverage that would obviate some of these claims or policies vis-a-vis the nature of the claims you\u2019ve seen so far, are there issues or questions as to coverage?", "Jay Fishman ", " ", "It\u2019s very important first to remember that in claims made policies defense costs are contained inside the limits unlike traditional occurrence policies where the obligation to defend run outside the limits and so the obligation to defend can simply run on, in effect forever, at least theoretically.  ", "With claims made policies the defense costs fall inside the limits so they are very much quantifiable.  To the extent that defense costs emerge, they emerge first at the primary level.  Those who have the primary policy will provide defense.  Of course, they will assuming that there\u2019s an indemnification obligation.  Eventually it will run up the policy to where if it continues to go excess riders eventually get dragged into the defense obligation sequentially.  ", "I think one of the things that we take some comfort in -- and it\u2019s in the analysis of the 30 claims and notice of claims that we\u2019ve got -- is that only five of them are primary,  25 of them are excess so at the moment you see the average attachment points there.  One can make an assumption as to the litigation costs and all the rest.  It sure feels good in this case to be an excess provider rather than a primary provider.

", "We don\u2019t usually break that apart when we\u2019re disclosing it between frequency and severity, because sometimes those move counter to each other.  We feel it\u2019s really more appropriate to project them in aggregate.", "Jay Fishman ", " ", "Independent of the mix change which we are trying to highlight on page 22, obviously page 21 shows a modest increase in frequency.  It\u2019s very difficult to look out and predict with any thoughtfulness what\u2019s going to happen.  You\u2019re talking about everything from numbers of miles driven to the impact of fuel and seatbelt usage and cell phone usage and changing state laws that require hands-free.  ", "There are so many variables that go into frequency.  I don\u2019t think that we particularly have any great insight into why something would change.  Again, that\u2019s independent of the mix dynamic on page 22.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners ", "Are you pricing for low single digit claims inflation currently?", "Joe Lacher", " ", "The guidance that we provided anticipates that running through the environment.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners ", "That\u2019s not the question.  The question is whether or not you\u2019re pricing for it in your policies.", "Jay Fishman ", " ", "Let\u2019s back up for a moment.  We provide and have at our investor days given insight into the returns that we are recording in our businesses and as it relates to the personal lines business broadly and particularly it\u2019s well within the targeted returns of the business.  ", "If you\u2019re asking how we price a particular product in a particular market, it\u2019s a very complicated question.  We look for the returns on a book of business overall and the book of business continues to meet our target thresholds.  We\u2019re pricing it to do that.  I\u2019m not sure exactly how to answer the question but we\u2019re pricing the product to achieve our targeted returns.", "Joe Lacher", " ", "We look at targeted returns.  We look at the marketplace dynamics.  We look at opportunities for growth.  We look at what we expect will be the underlying loss trend and we put them all together.  We don\u2019t take any one of those variables independently and solely make a price change on that.  We\u2019re not trying to dodge the question.  You\u2019ve got to take all four, five of those things and mix them together.", "Jay Fishman ", " ", "Again, broadly stated, we price the product achieve our targeted returns given everything we see happening in the marketplace.  So a silly assumption would be that we price it to achieve targeted returns assuming a decrease in loss trend.  We are not assuming a decrease in loss trend.  We are essentially assuming that loss trend will continue at low single-digits.  That\u2019s how we price our product.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners ", "I think we\u2019re all just trying to figure out if auto has bottomed out industrywide.  There\u2019s certain mixed results from various companies.", "Jay Fishman ", " ", "I don\u2019t have a comment I can make on industrywide dynamics.  Page 21 is giving you very specific insight into our book and you can see that our loss trend has been running for the last several quarters in the low single-digit and total loss trend and that\u2019s how we\u2019re pricing our product.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill Partners ", "Thank you for the increased disclosure.  That detail is very helpful.", "Operator", "", "Gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time.  I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Connelly for closing remarks.", "Michael Connelly", "Thanks very much for taking the time with us today to discuss what was a terrific 2007.

(Operator Instructions)  ", "At this time I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  ", "Gabriella Nawi", "", "Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of the second quarter 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and web cast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.Travelers.com under the Investor section. ", "With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer;  Brian McLean, President Operating Officer; Joseph Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select businesses, as well as other members of senior management.", "They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the web cast presentation as they go through their prepared remarks and then we\u2019ll open it up for questions. ", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the web cast.", "Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. ", "Actual results may differ materially from our current expectation due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. ", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation\u2019s are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements, and other materials that are available in the Investor section of our website, www.Travelers.com. ", "With that I\u2019m going to turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you Gabby and welcome to the team.  It is good to have you here.  Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today.  We are very pleased with our solid results this quarter with operating earnings of $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share, operating return on equity of 14.3% and a combined ratio of 89.3%.  ", "Rather than focusing on specific results we posted this quarter which Jay, Brian and Joe will review with you in detail, this morning I\u2019m going to take a few minutes to share our perspective on the current operating environment.  ", "Reviewing our first six months the underlying business has shaped up about as we had expected.  Our revenue strategies are paying off in each of our segments and we see that in our retention rates which remain very high.  As we outlined in Investor Day our agents and brokers are embracing our products and that is reflected in the significant increase in deal flow to us in Business Insurance, primarily from Travelers Express, our new small commercial platform and Industry Edge, our new middle market products. ", "In personal insurance as well our progress is evidenced by the success of Quantum Auto and Quantum Home.  Nevertheless, our close rates are actually down as we have responded with discipline to the more competitive marketing business environment.  We have tremendous tenure among our underwriters and we are pleased they have applied their knowledge learned during previous cycles by exercising such discipline in this market place. ", "So far this year rate and underwriting loss trends are generally developing as we had expected they would with some variances about which Brian will speak later.  Net investment income is down as short rates declined much more than we had originally anticipated they would and returns on non-fixed income investments, while positive, remain significantly lower than last year.  We continue to be extremely pleased with our asset portfolio.  We are gratified that Moody\u2019s upgraded our debt and insurance financial strength ratings during the second quarter while so many other companies are being pressured to raise capital.  Travelers remains very strong with a superior balance sheet and significant liquidity. ", "When we look out to the rest of the year we are aware of the current economic environment and the potential for an interesting combination of continued low interest rates, a lower growth economy but higher inflation.  We are looking at a macroeconomic environment which has changed significantly over the last six months and we are certainly taking that environment into account in terms of how we go to market. ", "Let me be clear, we have not yet seen evidence of any real spike in inflation in our loss trend data.  Finally, we have been disciplined with regard to the left side of our balance sheet as we have with the right side.  Bill Heyman and his folks have done a terrific job in thinking about risks and in making sure that our risks and return equation is disciplined and thoughtful.  As a result so far we have been able to avoid all of the missteps that plague so many other financial service companies.  ", "We have managed our business with long-term returns and profitability in mind and this philosophy has served us particularly well.  So tying it all together we remain committed to our long-term financial objectives and I believe the franchise is well positioned to achieve them.  History would suggest that our confidence is well placed.  Since January of 2005 we have achieved an average return on equity of 15.3% after $1.9 billion in after tax catastrophe losses including the largest U.S. catastrophe on record as well as an increasingly competitive pricing environment in much of our business dating back to 2005. ", "Our underwriting results over time are a real indication of our underwriting experience, skill and discipline.  So we look forward to our goal of mid teens ROE over time, it is based on what the businesses have achieved, how we underwrite and how we manage our capital. ", "With that let me turn it over to Jay. ", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay.  Let me begin by going through some of the highlights during the quarter as shown on page 3 of the web cast.  As Jay mentioned, second quarter 2008 operating income was $918 million or $1.50 per diluted share producing an operating return on equity of 14.3%.  Our weighted average diluted share count declined to 611 million shares as we continued to generate capital in excess of our growth needs and used $750 million of that excess capital to repurchase 15.3 million of our common shares in the current quarter. ", "Despite dividends and share repurchases of $4.1 billion in the last twelve months, adjusted book value per share grew by 12% in the past year and 3% in the current quarter.  Later Brian and Joe will discuss the drivers behind the slight decrease in net written premiums so let me end my comments on this page by noting how pleased we are that we received the ratings upgrade from Moody\u2019s this quarter. ", "Page 4 of the web cast shows the components of operating return on equity as we first displayed them at our May 2008 Investor Day conference.  Fixed income net invested income less interest expense remained the major driver of year-to-date operating ROE.  This passage of time component produced an 8.8% return in the current period, down slightly from the prior two years due to lower short-term interest rates. ", "A much smaller contributor to operating ROE both historically and year-to-date is non-fixed income investment income which produced a positive return of 0.3%, down as expected due to current market conditions. ", "Underwriting income continued to provide a very strong return of 5.8% year-to-date driven by healthy underlying underwriting margins along with net favorable prior year development and despite a very high weather related losses.  ", "As the data on page 5 indicates both CATs and net favorable prior year reserve development played a meaningful role in our results.  CAT losses which were concentrated in the business and personal insurance segments resulted from the unusually large number of severe weather events that occurred during the quarter including tornados, hail storms and floods in various regions of the United States.  CAT losses net of reinsurance added 6.6 points to our GAAP combined ratio this quarter.", "Net favorable prior year reserve development resulting from better than expected loss experiences in each of our business segments reduced our second quarter GAAP combined ratio by 9.8 points.  As this slide indicates our GAAP combined ratio when adjusted for CAT net favorable prior year reserve development and last year\u2019s timing impact for the change to the fixed value based agent compensation program increased by 2 points.  This increase, which was less than the 2.4 increase in this year\u2019s first quarter, was generally consistent with our underlying expectations for pricing and loss cost trends and also included the impact of a small increase in the number of large property losses that Brian will discuss later. ", "Page 6 provides further information about our net favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter.  Development was concentrated in our commercial businesses for accident years 2004-2007 primarily related to liability lines and was net of an $85 million increase in environmental reserves.  ", "There are many factors that have contributed to our favorable reserve development in recent quarters.  Some we can control and others we cannot.  Within our control are processes that help to detect unfavorable trends that could lead to unfavorable development such as having the analytical tools, management information and culture to maintain strict underwriting discipline at all times while maintaining thoughtful and responsible reserve methodologies that constantly look back to underwriting and claims experience. ", "Also within our control are initiatives that can actually give rise to favorable reserve development such as the claims initiatives we introduced in recent years that reduced actual claim costs from claim costs assumed in reserving that had been based upon historical settlement values.  These claim initiatives have included faster settlement of auto claims and the use of managed care techniques for Worker\u2019s comp claims and others.  ", "Factors that are not within our control include improvements in the legal and judicial environment including torte reform.  All of these factors have continued to play a role in the favorable development of our prior year reserves and in many cases translate into improved estimates and profitability in current year business. ", "Before turning the microphone over to Brian I did want to provide an update to certain information we last provided to you over a year ago at our May 2007 Investor Day Conference.  Since that time we have been actively managing our CAT risks by reducing our hurricane exposure in coastal areas in the southeast and changing our reinsurance coverage to reduce hail risks and related capital charges particularly as they relate to northeast winds.   Our focus has been on reducing exposure to highly severe, extremely low frequency events. ", "As can be seen on Page 7, our estimated probable maximum loss for a single hurricane at the 1 in 100 level net of reinsurance and after tax has been reduced to $1.4 billion or 5% of common equity.  A single hurricane at the 1 in 250 level also net of reinsurance and after tax has been reduced to $2.2 billion or 9% of common equity.  I should point out that these estimates correlate to extremely large industry events much larger than say a Katrina. ", "Our P&L estimates are based upon assumptions outlined on Page 2 of the Appendix to this web cast presentation and factor in the July 1, 2008 CAT reinsurance renewals that are incorporated into the chart provided on Pages 20 and 21 in the Appendix.  The only significant change to our CAT reinsurance program and this year\u2019s July 1 renewal was the addition of another $250 million of northeast only coverage which brought our northeast CAT treaty up to $500 million and when combined with our $500 million CAT bound brought our total northeast coverage up to $1 billion, all excess of $2.25 billion.  ", "The cost of our national CAT treaty was $77 million for the coverage period July 1, 2008 through July 30, 2009, down from $100 million for the prior year period.  I should also point out this information regarding P&L is based upon output from analytical modeling related to probability and potential losses which are inherently unpredictable and that actual CAT losses could be materially greater than indicated.  I urge you to read Page 23 of the Appendix of this web cast and with that let me turn things over to Brian. ", "Brian MacLean", "", "Thanks Jay.  I\u2019ll begin by going over the production statistics for our commercial businesses and as you can see the results continue to be strong.  Current market dynamics are obviously impacting our results but as our numbers indicate in the aggregate we are managing these market dynamics quite well.  ", "Looking at the details on Slide 8 you can see that retentions remain at high levels across all the domestic, U.S. commercial businesses.  These overall high retention levels reflect our ability to withstand market place pressure and execute on our strategy to keep profitable business and not sacrifice underwriting results.  ", "In the international operations retention was down due to the intentional non-renewal of certain property business in Canada and auto business in Ireland and competitive market conditions impacting our Lloyd\u2019s business.  Our business in the UK continued to have strong retention numbers.  ", "The renewal price change which reflects both rate and exposure changes remains generally consistent with recent quarters.  RPC in the Select business which represents about \u00bc of the business insurance segment was still positive and consistent with the last two quarters.  In the remaining domestic businesses the change in RPC was down modestly due primarily to declining exposure which reflects the broader economic environment.  Underlying rate changes were consistent with last quarter.  ", "The improvement in the international renewal price change was due to increased exposures primarily in Lloyd\u2019s.  Again, our organization has done a great job of preserving our renewal book at appropriate price levels.  ", "The new business dollars are shown on slide 9.  In the aggregate they are essentially flat with the second quarter last year and last quarter.  In the domestic businesses they were down slightly and in the international operations new business was up primarily due to Lloyd\u2019s.  To get the real story you have to get beneath the written dollars and look at deal flow, quote ratios and hit ratios. ", "Overall flow of new business submissions was up in most all our businesses and in some businesses they were up dramatically.  For example, in commercial accounts, our middle market franchise and construction which combined comprised about 25% of the premiums in the segment.  Quotes year-to-date were up around 20% from 2007 and 50% from 2006.  Our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong position with agents and customers have continued to drive this heavy flow of opportunity. ", "We continue to feel good about the quality of the opportunities we are seeing.  Accordingly we are quoting on much of this business and our quote ratio remains fairly consistent with historical trends.  Unfortunately the pricing on new business continues to deteriorate and since we are being just as selective as we have always been our hit ratio, or the percentage of our quotes where we are winning, has been declining through 2007 and the first half of 2008.  We believe that is evidence of our underwriting discipline. ", "We think the real story here is that we have built a franchise which is driving significantly more opportunities our way.  In this more challenging pricing environment that has enabled us to maintain share where we seek to do so.  More importantly it leaves us extremely well positioned for when the market conditions improve. ", "With respect to international the increase in new business over the prior-year quarter is driven by Lloyd\u2019s.  As part of our strategy we have hired two underwriting teams, power and utilities and yachts that have generated over $50 million in the quarter.  These are experienced teams that understand their markets. ", "Turning to the business segment financial results on Slide 10 you can see that net written premiums declined 4% quarter-over-quarter.  The decline is due to the market pricing dynamics I just discussed and in these market conditions this feels like the right answer especially with retention levels remaining very strong.  ", "On Slide 11 business insurance operating income was down 18% from the same quarter last year.  The adjusted combined ratio on the page was 93.3 for the quarter, a two point deterioration from the second quarter last year.  This decline reflects some compression of our core margin which is essentially in line with our expectation of benign loss trends and moderate price declines as well as a modest increase in the number of large property losses which I will discuss in a few minutes. ", "Our expense ratio after considering the timing impact of the agent compensation program is up about 9/10 of a point.  6/10 of this is the result of a reduction in national account fee income and the remainder is primarily from the decline in earned premiums. ", "So for the domestic U.S. business we feel great about how we are executing in some difficult market conditions.  Business volumes and margins are down but modestly and given the market place we believe that is a very good result. ", "Turning to financial, professional and international insurance on Slide 12 the segment continued to produce positive results with operating income up 34% from the same quarter last year driven by the favorable prior year development.  The adjusted combined ratio of 95.3 was also up 2 points in this segment from the second quarter of 2007 reflecting the same market conditions I just described in business insurance as well as the increase in large property losses. ", "It is probably worth noting right here that our increase in loss and LAE ratio in this segment is not the result of increased losses in our management liability business which includes our DNO portfolio or our surety business which includes our exposure to contractors in general and the central artery project in Boston in particular. ", "Financial, professional and international net written premiums of $985 million in the quarter was flat with the prior year.  Bonded financial products premium quarter-over-quarter declined but was more than offset by net written premium growth in our international operations which benefited from the new business growth in the two units at Lloyd\u2019s also reflecting the favorable impact of exchange rates.", "Now I want to take a minute to talk about the property large loss dynamic that I mentioned is running through both commercial segments.  This increase in loss activity is being driven primarily by a modest increase in the number of large property losses in excess of $5 million net of reinsurance.  We obviously anticipate some losses of this size but in the first half of 2008 the actual number of losses was above our normal expectations. ", "So to really quantify this for you we are talking about seven losses in business insurance and five in financial, professional and international.  More importantly we manage our limits tightly with a maximum net retention of $15 million in business insurance and the UK and $5 million in our Canadian and Lloyd\u2019s operations.  So in the aggregate it is not a large financial exposure but it is affecting our combined ratio comparisons in 2008. ", "The biggest issue is do we see this as a trend and if so is it from our underwriting. I can tell you for all large losses we scrutinize this very closely.  We have examined all our large property losses.  We have challenged ourselves and looked at all the data.  The events run the gamut from the fire at Universal Studios to a large sugar plant explosion to a fire at a hotel under construction in Boston.  We have not seen anything we can yet call a trend other than the obvious that many commercial losses are fire related.  ", "So our assessment is this is not a result of our underwriting or pricing decisions but is an aberration.  We are aware that industry-wide losses are also up and so we know that the issue is not unique to our results.  In summary, although it is certainly worth noting for the quarter and year-to-date results we don\u2019t see this as a trend but we are watching it very closely.  ", "Stepping back to the larger picture overall our results in this quarter considering the softer insurance market place and the general economic conditions are very solid.  We experienced strong levels of retention, modest price declines on our retained book, a significant flow of new submissions and our core margins are performing as expected. ", "With that let me turn it over to Joseph Lacher for the personal insurance results. ", "Joseph Lacher", "", "Thanks Brian.  Personal insurance results start on Page 13.  Not surprisingly weather is a significant part of this segment\u2019s results for the quarter.  Even against that backdrop, personal insurance produced strong results so the combined ratio of 97.3% and $122 million in operating earnings.  ", "We have strong production results with increased new business and retention renewal pricing in year-over-year policy in force growth consistent with recent quarters.  When comparing the quarter\u2019s profitability to the second quarter of 2007 earnings were down primarily driven by significant adverse CAT and non-CAT weather related losses, somewhat less favorable prior year reserve development and lower net investment income.  ", "Excluding these items and the impact and the timing of the 2007 agent compensation program change the underlying combined ratio was in line with the prior year quarter.  Looking specifically at our property results on Page 14 and in the statistical supplement, we can see the impact of adverse weather on the quarter.  It is not news to any of you that the industry experience for the second quarter is projected to be one of the worst second quarters in a long time.  ", "While our property results were impacted by nearly 19 points in catastrophes, we still reported an underwriting profit with a 96.5% combined ratio.  At the same time we continued to grow our business.  Policies in force increased 3%; retention remained stable at 86% with a renewal price change of +6%.  ", "We remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volume despite competitive market conditions.  Quantum Home policies now represent a little over 10% of our policies in force.  ", "Shifting to auto, our combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%.  Catastrophes negatively impacted that combined by 1.5 points in the quarter.  We are pleased with our production results in the current market conditions.  New business volume was up over 12% versus the prior year quarter and is at the highest levels we have experienced since the first half of 2006 and the roll out of Quantum Auto. ", "Policies in force grew 3% over the prior year quarter and at the same time our renewal price change was at +2% with retentions consistent with prior quarters.  We continue to make investments in our business, infrastructure and distribution capabilities to fuel our long-term profitable growth.  These investments continue to impact our results.  ", "Our ongoing agency appointment strategy is one example.  As an anecdotal illustration one of our regions reported in their last internal operating review that over 20% of their new business volume this year came from agents appointed within the last 18 months.  They continue to deploy a systematic, segmented distribution and management process that is yielding growth opportunities without the need to be imprudently competitive on pricing.  ", "Turning to page 15 I would like to touch on loss inflation in the auto line.  Excluding the anticipated impacts from the broader risk profile of Quantum, we saw loss inflation in the quarter to be essentially flat.  Frequency trends were down just slightly.  We experienced total severity trends up just slightly.  Similar to recent quarters we saw damage related severity increasing in the low single-digits and bodily injury severity slightly decreasing. ", "We believe this is a big deal.  These numbers are not loose impressions but rather are based on actual experience.  As we have previously discussed our bodily injury results appear out of pattern and better than what a number of our competitors have reported.  We believe this is a direct result of our claim initiatives which leverage the strength and breadth of our multi-line claim organization.  This continues to be a leveragable competitive advantage for us.  ", "While the market place remains competitive we are seeing increasing signs of firming particularly in the auto line.  We are continuing to monitor these, monitor loss trends and profitability and market place conditions as well as the change in economic climate.  We adjust our tactics going forward.  We remain pleased with the businesses\u2019 underlying performance and look forward to building on that success.  ", "With that I will turn it back over to Jay. ", "Jay Benet", "", "Thanks Joe.  Net investment income for the quarter is shown on Page 16 with $624 million after tax or $134 million lower than the prior year quarter.  Fixed income related NII was down only $7 million from the prior year quarter and was impacted by the lower shorter term interest rates.  The major variance between the two periods occurred due to non-fixed income returns which remain positive well below the prior year period level as we had expected. ", "This level of non-fixed income related NII resulted from lower real estate and private equity partnership gains due to low transaction volume given current market conditions.  Overall our after-tax yield was 3.4% for the quarter. ", "Turning to Page 17, our investment portfolio and our balance sheet continue to be in terrific shape as we continue to avoid the issues that others have had to deal with.  We ended the quarter with almost $26 billion of common equity X FAS115 and book value per share X FAS115 of $43.45, up 3% in the current quarter and up 12% from a year ago.  All this after $3.4 billion of share repurchases and $730 million of common stock dividends during the past twelve months. ", "Our capital remains at or above all of our target levels and we continue to generate significant amounts of excess capital and liquidity. Our debt to total cap ratio was 19.7% at the end of the quarter compared to our 20% target and holding company liquidity was $2.2 billion or twice our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends. ", "Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for full-year 2008.  We continue to expect fully diluted operating income per share of $5.55 to $5.85 which translates into an operating return on equity of approximately 13-14%.  Our guidance incorporates our results for the first half of the year and assumes the continuation of lower short-term interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the first half for non-fixed income investment returns. ", "Our guidance now assumes full-year CAT losses of $785 million pre-tax or $510 million after tax or $0.84 per share after tax which has been adjusted for actual CAT losses in the first half of the year.  No further prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable.

First on the auto frequency trend can you outline to what extent you think that is driven by higher gas prices and consumers driving less and the sustainability there?  Also with the combined ratio in auto in the high 90\u2019s do you feel you need to be taking more rate?  The second issue I wanted to touch on is I don\u2019t know if you can quantify the fully impact of the non-CAT weather in the large property losses in the quarter and finally Jay if you could touch on your appetite for M&A at this point?

My answer is going to be equal speculation at this point unencumbered by fact.  It looks like it to us.  There is no real way to tell.  That seems to be the most logical conclusion.  We are not making the assumption it is sustainable and will continue to drop over the long-term.  Given where we are right now that is not the basic assumption we are making going forward.  We are obviously constantly watching it and we\u2019ll see what happens but we are not assuming sustainability in terms of how we are going to navigate the business.

The combined ratio in auto that we generated in the quarter and I think in the six months, let\u2019s check that but I believe it is true, the returns had an X for the auto business it would still be in that box that meets our targeted threshold of returns.

Jay I heard you remarks at the outset on inflation.  You seemed to recap that it is on the radar screen but not yet showing up on the loss cause trends you are analyzing.  At least not in an outsized way.  I guess one confirming that is the right characterization.  Two, what types of inflation are highest on your radar screen? ", "Jay Fishman", "", "Your characterization is actually right on.  I think all of us are aware of the inflation risks predominately from what we have been reading in the financial press, watching oil now albeit at $126 per barrel rather than $140.  The sort of attention that has been given to it.  What I think that people would anecdotally think is perhaps we have seen it in construction materials already.  We have certainly read about increases of prices in cement and increasing prices in building materials generally. Interestingly enough it hasn\u2019t yet evidenced itself in any substantive, serious way in our loss trend data.  Notwithstanding under the anecdotal observations.  But given the fact we incorporate estimated inflation as we price our product and reserve our product it would be foolish of us not to have it higher on the radar screen than perhaps it might have been six months ago.  We have, the industry has benefited from a long standing period of benign inflation and I think that has to some extent offset some of the pricing pressure that has been around for a couple of years.  If in fact that inflation dynamic changes it is obviously something we need to begin to think about in the context of our pricing strategies.  That is I think why we identified it as an item of concern and it belongs on the radar screen for any responsible management team. ", "Brian MacLean", "", "When you look at the hierarchy of concern the other one that would be high on the list is medical inflation flow through.  Obviously our Workers Comp and many of our liability claims so we watch medical inflation very closely.  ", "William Wilt \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you for that.  The same characterization holds true there?  It is on the radar screen but no apparent change? ", "Brian MacLean", "", "Correct.  We are always seeing minor ups and downs but nothing systemic.

That was due to seeing both pharmaceutical costs and long term care costs inflated higher than what we thought.  It actually helps to break the comp disclosure down by year, which I don\u2019t think we do publicly.  The more recent accident years, I think 2005, 2006 and 2007 I think were still developing favorably and it would be 2004 and prior that were net negative.

What you are hearing on this call is actually an example of the feedback that exists between the claims department, loss analysis right back in the underwriting.

I guess I\u2019m looking for an update to that discussion.  Retention ratios hanging in there.  Has the new business penalty shrunk?  Is that part of the reason perhaps that retention ratios are remaining stable? ", "Jay Fishman", "", "No, I don\u2019t think so.  That is the short answer.  First of all I characterize the retention ratios as actually worth hanging in there.  I think actually [inaudible] in a sense there.  They are different.  This is a different cycle certainly than anybody sitting around this table has ever experienced before.  This long into a pricing deterioration, albeit a modest one where retentions have stayed at the levels they are and continue to look just very, very solid.  If anything in the second quarter and this is more anecdotal than it is factual because it is hard to track it quite that currently, our sense was that the market for new business actually became somewhat more heated and the little bit of data I can offer that is interesting, Brian ran through the points so quickly I think it gets lost.  A number of actual field quote submissions that we are seeing is up in many of our businesses and they are up dramatically.  We want to talk about competitive advantages.  If you never get a deal on a house if you never bid on it.

The quote ratio, the number of times we quote, has largely stayed flat but the hit ratio is actually down.  The number of times we are succeeding is actually down and we take that as kind of a leading indicator on the nature of the competitive market for new business.

Given\u2026I doubt that many of them would be talking about a lot more deal flow right now.  I think part of it honestly does speak to our position in the market place in both our ability to retain our accounts and our ability to attract significantly more deal flow in an economic environment where I don\u2019t think there is a lot more deal flow out there in the aggregate.

", "Jay Benet", "", "That is a great question.  When we talk about where the reserve development is taking place and obviously it gets highlighted in particular years.  But it also goes back to something that is inherent in the reserving process.  That being that when you start analyzing 2004, 2004 provides you information as to not just 2004 but the starting points then for 2005, 2006 and 2007.  So each one of the analogies kind of rolls into the next.  When we talk about adjusting 2007 it is not an adjustment based on just current long-tail information coming in at a rate that is lower than what we expected.  That is not the primary driver.

Every one added something different from another.  So the way in which you approach thinking about what it did for your franchise the transaction simply adds volume, you bring in geographically and you kind of analyze one way.  A transaction that helps you get through a strategic imitative that might be important you might have a longer view of.

In its simplest form and I can tell you what we have seen so far is we have exposure while positive in the quarter was nonetheless lower than what it had been.  That is an early indicator of some slow down and that is what it is.  I don\u2019t know for sure.  It is too early to tell.

We are responsible for what we say and ultimately the reason we came out with our commentary on the Zurich transaction was that it was being viewed by everyone as though we had said something.

I\u2019d like to just leave it at that. I don\u2019t think I have anything more to say about any specific company or rumor. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch. ", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Jay your stock has been hovering around or even slightly below your book value per share.  I guess theoretically what the market is saying is either they don\u2019t believe your book value per share which frankly given the reserves that you have seen and given the cleanliness of your asset portfolio doesn\u2019t seem to be a big concern or the second issue is your ROE is relatively quickly going down to your cost of equity capital, 9-10%.  I guess I wanted to focus on that.  What kind of environment would you have to see for your ROE to go from where they are now down to that level and what do you think the chances of that sort of environment are of emerging in the next 2 years? ", "Jay Fishman", "", "There is actually a slide in Jay Benet\u2019s presentation that actually answers that question.  If you take a look on page 4 so far for this year we have earned a 9.1% return on equity from our investment portfolio in an environment of short rates.  We can circle the short rates on that slide because they are actually half of what they were a year ago.  1.7 short rates versus 3.8 a year ago.  We\u2019re talking about a 200 basis point drop in short rates in that period of time.  ", "So we had a 9.1% return on equity just from the investment portfolio which means that the answer to the question is 100% combined ratio would have produced a 9.1% return on equity in this quarter and you see the numbers.  How far are we away from 100% combined ratio?  If rates continue to go down 3-5% we will eventually get there but we are a long way from 100 now. ", "That is why four is there, to show there is a sustainable level of return on equity in our business just embedded in the left side of the balance sheet and it is pretty powerful.  I think that people tend to forget that and so that\u2019s why we present it that way. ", "Operator", "", "The next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS. ", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "You commented that pricing continues to be pretty competitive here.  I was wondering if you could get a bit more granular and say what lines of business right now are you worried about or actively pulling away from versus what lines of business you think are attractive.  Then can you provide some comments on what is happening in terms and conditions? ", "Brian MacLean", "", "Consistent with what we have said in the past and I think what a lot of other folks say from account size perspective maybe most importantly the larger the account the more pressure, not to say there isn\u2019t pricing pressure everywhere.  But clearly smaller accounts a lot less than larger accounts.  You can see that a little bit with the fact that in small commercial we are still seeing total price change a little positive and underneath that total rate change would be slightly negative but very consistent.  From a line of business perspective I would say large property stuff is under pressure and something we are looking at although the large loss dynamic I talked about especially being industry wide is beginning to have a lot of folks rethink that.  So that might be one that we see some signs of actually the softening mitigating a little bit.  ", "Nothing dramatic other than that within the lines.  It is much more of account size. ", "Jay Fishman", "", "The other thing I was thinking about with some extent to size is if we had to pick one and we are obviously very large but the excess casualty business, the umbrella business, is one that has been subject to not an insignificant amount of price deterioration. ", "Brian MacLean", "", "Even in that business you use the words pulling away from.  We are not pulling away from that market but it is one where more accounts than not we see some pressure there.  ", "Jay Fishman", "", "It really comes back to looking at the retention rates.  We are not in effect pulling back from anything in our business.  It would show up in the retentions if we were in a serious way.  I think the relevant question is in the new business environment what is going on and you can look at the new business numbers and get a pretty good feel for it I think of what it is and how we are reacting to it. ", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Are trends and conditions loosening at all? ", "Brian MacLean", "", "Not dramatically.  There is always some movement as markets move.  On our book I would say not dramatically and I would probably have the same comment.  The bigger the account the more pressure. ", "Jay Fishman", "", "If you think about it though, as we describe it, there is only a few businesses we are in where terms and conditions play. Small commercial is one. You really wouldn\u2019t talk about as the question is being asked in terms of conditions.  You would think about it actual property.  You would think about it in some of those lines; the individually negotiated if you like accounts.  The smaller you get the less it becomes a substantive discussion.  Is that fair?  ", "Brian MacLean", "", "[Products].  ", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "One last question for Joe.  On the TD severity that you said was up modestly what would you attribute that to and would you expect the impact of raw material prices rising here may put some pressure on that severity here going forward? ", "Joseph Lacher", "", "I think it is just generally what is in there already.  It is the normal inflation in costs whether it is parts or labor rates or the like.  You get some level of model symbol drip that is running through the physical damage severity which is the newer cars tend to have a higher value and there is a different repair cost there.  It is that and we would expect that trend would generally continue.  ", "Jay Fishman", "", "From a macroeconomic level there hasn\u2019t been any meaningful wage push inflation yet.  That doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be but you can actually look at Bureau of Labor Statistics data and you\u2019ll see there really is no significant wage push.  That is one of the things we will keep watching as a leading indicator. ", "Operator", "", "Your last question will come from the line of Josh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref. ", "Josh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref", "", "On the investment portfolio no one would argue that you don\u2019t have one of the cleanest ones out there.  I\u2019m just curious how you feel about the turmoil that is surrounding the GSE\u2019s and how that may affect your securitized leader at the more senior levels and secondarily with the two mono lines being put on watch for downgrade by Moody\u2019s\u2026I noticed that your AAA\u2019s have dropped sequentially during the quarter. I imagine that is because of downgrades of the mono lines in your Moody book. If you could talk about how if any deal went to AA how that would impact your credit quality? ", "Jay Fishman", "", "Josh we gave an analysis last quarter where we took the entire municipal fund portfolio and it is on the web, you can see it, where we actually gave the ratings, underlined the securities x the wrap and there is an analysis there and that hasn\u2019t changed any significant way.  The portfolio would change from a rating perspective modestly if\u2026", "Josh Smith \u2013 TIAA Cref", "I just noticed 10% went from AAA to AA and I thought it might have been due to mono lines losing the rating. ", "[Bill]", "", "Let\u2019s go back and take the questions in order if we could.  In a way we look at the GSE\u2019s not unlike municipals.  The mortgage backed securities can be viewed as mortgage backs in which the residual is insured by the GSE.  In terms of straight obligations of the GSE\u2019s our total for both is a mere $19 million which could be characterized as nothing more than a place holder.  We look at them as financial institutions which have always been much more leveraged than the big money center banks and are treated accordingly. ", "With respect to our mortgage banks we look at them on the strength of the underlying mortgages and try not to attribute too much value to the guarantee of the U.S. government if there is one or the guarantee by the GSE of the pools.  The underlying mortgages and underlying mortgage banks are in terms of age and seasoning we think pretty secure so we feel pretty good about them. ", "Skipping to the municipals I think one has to remember that the principle concern with the mono lines is less with their insuring municipal bonds which had very low full rates to begin with than with their insuring of structured products and with respect to those products when the insurance falls away there is much greater concern.  With respect to municipal bonds again I think one has to remember that the rating scales are very different. ", "AA, maybe even less than AA municipal defaults with the same frequency as an AAA corporate.  You have probably read the newspaper of Congressional testimony by municipal treasurers asking or demanding the rating scales be adjusted.  We have always felt very secure about the credit of the municipal portfolio even in the absence of insurance and we have never owned a security where we felt we needed the insurance.  Our view has been valuable if the County treasurer absconds with some money but in a period of financial stress the insurers are likely to have as much stress as the insurance and that is what we are seeing.  So I hope that is responsive. ", "Jay Fishman", "", "I think that closes us up.  Gabby?

(Operator Instructions) At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Miss Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.  ", "Gabriella Nawi", "Welcome to the Travelers discussion of the third quarter 2008 results.  Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation earlier this morning.  All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  ", "With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO;  Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer;  Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Joe Lacher, head of our Personal and Select Businesses; as well as other members of senior management.  They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.  They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through the prepared remarks and then we will open it for questions.  ", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast.  Our presentation today includes certain forwardlooking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements other than statements of historical facts may be forwardlooking statements.  Specifically, our earnings guidance are forwardlooking, and we may make other forwardlooking statements about company results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company's reserves, and other topics.  ", "The company cautions investors that any forwardlooking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.  Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due a variety of factors.  These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10Q and 10K filed with the SEC.  We do not undertake any obligation to update forwardlooking statements.  ", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be nonGAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations are included our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website, travelers.com.  With that, I will turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Before we get into the specific results, let me start this morning with something of a view from 40,000\u00a0feet.  The last several months have been unprecedented in financial market dislocation and its impact on the financial services community broadly.  We have seen upheaval at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and AIG.  We have seen governments all around the world step up and commit trillions of dollars to financial institutions that previously appeared to be pillars of strength.  ", "Given all of this turmoil, the speed with which it has happened, and the number of pitfalls challenging the financial services industry over these months, we couldn't be more pleased with the way Travelers has managed through this dislocation.  The success that we have had has little to do with anything that we have done these last several months, but rather result from the philosophy and culture that has existed here for a long time.  ", "We are first and foremost an insurance underwriting organization, and the skills to do that successfully are at the highest level here.  Our investment function as best articulated by Bill Heyman, our Chief Investment Officer himself, is in business to support our insurance underwriting operations and to do so with an extraordinarily balanced view of risk and return.  ", "That philosophy has kept our investment decisions straightforward and simple and viewed towards providing consistent and appropriate risk-adjusted returns over time rather than responding to the investment idea of the day.  Simply put, we focused on providing quality products and service to our agents and customers and building a longterm value of our franchise.  We couldn't be more proud of what we have accomplished and the fact that we have come through this as a strong, resilient, wellcapitalized company.", "The results for this year speak for themselves.  For the 9month period, we posted net income of $2.1\u00a0billion and a return on equity of 10.9%.  All of our financial strength indicators are at or better than target levels, including our holding company liquidity, now just in excess of $2\u00a0billion, which is approximately twice our target level.", "For the quarter, we posted operating income of $330\u00a0million after tax, or $0.55 per share.  As we previously reported, the third quarter was meaningfully impacted by $682\u00a0million after tax of storm losses from Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly.  However, the losses from these storms were consistent overall with our risk models and pricing assumptions.  Given our size, storm losses such as these will occur from time to time.  ", "While difficult financial market conditions impacted our net investment income to some extent for the quarter, and Jay will speak about that in a bit, our insurance underwriting operations continue to be pretty much consistent with what we saw in the second quarter; and it's very much steady as it goes.", "Retentions remain high across virtually all of our businesses, and the loss cost and rate changes generally continued in pattern with the second quarter.  ", "The story, however, is less about the results of the third quarter than the positioning of this organization.  Our underwriting discipline, both with respect to investing and insurance was clearly evident this quarter.  Our net realized investment losses of $133\u00a0million after tax were quite modest when compared with our overall investment portfolio, and the change in our unrealized losses was driven largely by general changes in spreads rather than issue or issuerspecific deterioration.  As evidence of our underwriting strength, excluding the impacts of catastrophes and net favorable prior year reserve development, our combined ratio was 91.8%.  ", "As a result of specific initiatives, we continue to see a significant flow of new business opportunities.  We're fortunate to have ample liquidity, capital, and the ability to respond to the market.  We are, of course, in the property casualty business with all the risks and opportunities that entails.  But all things considered, even with 20/20 hindsight, there isn't much we would have done differently.  As a consequence, we're as well positioned as we could be.  We remain committed to producing shareholder value by seeking to achieve mid-teens return on equity over time.  Since January\u00a01, 2005, our cumulative operating return on equity now stands at approximately 15%.  We are going to keep our comments very brief today, especially since there really hasn't been much change in the insurance environment broadly.  We'll leave ample time to answer any questions you have.  With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jack.  Let me begin by reiterating that our investment portfolio and our balance sheet continue to be in terrific shape, despite the turmoil that's been taking place in the financial market.  Page 4 of the webcast shows that we ended the quarter with almost $25.5\u00a0billion of common equity excluding FAS 115 and book value per share excluding FAS 115 of $43.34, up 5% yeartodate even after $2\u00a0billion of share repurchases and $535\u00a0million of stock dividends.", "Our operating company capital remains at or above all of our target levels, and we continue to generate significant amount of excess capital and liquidity.  Our debttototal capital ratio is 19.9% at the end of the quarter, compared to our 20% target, which is the midpoint of a 15% to 25% range that the derived from our doubleA ratings target.", "Holding company liquidity was $2.1\u00a0billion or almost twice our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends.  We expect to be able to use internal funds to retire all debts scheduled to mature during the next three years.  We're not relying on the commercial paper market and participate at a very modest level, generally $100\u00a0million or below only when rates are attractive.", "Page 5 of the webcast shows that composition of our investment portfolio at different points in time, along with certain of its characteristics.  Composition of the portfolio has been very stable in the periods shown.  Total fixed income comprising 94% and nonfixed income 6% of the total portfolio.  Its quality has been maintained at doubleA plus.  Its duration has been very steady, and the below investment grade portion of the fixed income portfolio is actually decreased to only 2.4%.  It remains a very well diversified portfolio across industries, investment types, and individual issuers.", "Having said this, our portfolio is not immune from recent market changes.  In this quarter, we did experience net realized losses of $116\u00a0million after tax, mostly related to impairments of Lehman and a small number of other fixed income holdings.  The unrealized loss on that portion of our investment portfolio, for which estimated market value is less than 80% of amortized costs, now stands at $270\u00a0million, up from $52\u00a0million at the end of the second quarter and mostly in this position for 30 days or less.  Still a small fraction of both total investments and shareholders' equity.", "We've always maintained the very rigorous process for identifying investments for which writedowns should be considered and take such actions when appropriate.", "At the end of the current quarter, we had pretax unrealized investment losses of $1.3\u00a0billion compared to a net unrealized gain of $86\u00a0million at the end of the second quarter.  This change in unrealized, which will not reflect in net income, is reflected in shareholders' equity pursuant to FAS 115.  This is primarily the result of credit spreads widening broadly during the quarter and, to a lesser extent, other unrealized losses widely distributed among issuers and not generally reflective of significant issuance or specific credit problem.  I would also like to point out that no single corporate issuer accounted for more than $40\u00a0million of the net unrealized loss at the end of the quarter.", "We've updated page 6 of the webcast to include additional areas of concern that have emerged this quarter in the financial market and their impact or lack thereof to Travelers.  We dramatically curtailed our securities lending program during the quarter, based on current market conditions to where we only have $15\u00a0million outstanding.  We experienced no losses in this program during the quarter and we do not expect any.  Also, we are not a party to any credit default swaps.", "As the slide indicates, we also remain unaffected by the other areas of market disruption discussed in prior quarters.", "As the data of page 7 indicates, both CATs and net favorable prior year reserve developments played a meaningful role in our results this quarter.  CAT losses of $682\u00a0million net of reinsurance and after tax which mostly related to Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly, added 19.1 points to our GAAP combined ratios this quarter.  A net favorable prior year reserve development of $210\u00a0million after tax resulting from betterthanexpected loss experience in each of our business segments reduced our GAAP combined ratio by 6.2 points.  ", "On a yeartodate basis, our GAAP combined ratio, even including the large CAT losses we have experienced during the year, was a very healthy 94%.  Ex CATs, net favorable prior year reserve developments and last year's timing impact of the change to the fixed valuebased agent compensation program, our GAAP combined ratio was 92.5%, an increase of 2.4 points from the prior year period.  We remain very pleased with the underlying profitability of our business.", "Page 8 of the webcast shows components of operating return on equity.  Fixed income, net investment income, less interest expense remained the major driver of yeartodate operating ROA.  This passage of time component produced an 8.7% return in the current period, down slightly from the prior two years due to lower shortterm interest rates.  A much smaller contributor to operating ROE, both historically and yeartodate, is nonfixed income investment income, which produced a very small positive return yeartodate, down from prior periods as expected and due to current market conditions.  ", "Underwriting income provided a return of 3% yeartodate, down from recent periods, due to the very high weatherrelated losses which offset underlying underwriting margins that were very healthy and high levels of net favorable prior year reserve development.  Cumulatively from January\u00a02005, we have produced a 15% annual operating ROE, consistent with our stated longerterm goal of mid-teens ROA.", "Net investment income for the third quarter, as shown on page 9, was $587\u00a0million after tax or $137\u00a0million lower than the prior year quarter.  Longterm fixed income related NII of $592\u00a0million was unchanged while the shortterm component of fixed income NII was down $27\u00a0million due to the lower shortterm interest rates.  The major variance between the two periods was the low level of nonfixed income related NII due to lower real estate hedge funds and private equity partnership returns in the current economic environment.", "Finally, our after tax yield was 3.2% for the quarter.  With that, let me turn the mike over to Brian and Joe for discussion of the underlying fundamentals of our businesses.", "Brian MacLean", "Before Joe and I get into the business results, let me take a few minutes to give some broad background.  The highlight is that our results, especially as they relate to the top line, remain stable.  I know that sounds out of pattern with the mood around broader economic trends, but our fundamentals are the same ones we have been describing for the last several years.  That is, we are retaining our customers at historically high levels and at close to expiring price and are seeing a healthy flow of new business.  This stability is partially a function of the market in which we compete, but also we believe a function of who we are.  That is, a company with solid financial performance whose people are not distracted by franchise changing events, but instead are focused on consistently executing on our strategy in their market place.  Given this dynamic, Joe and I will spend a little less time than usual on the actual numbers and leave more time for Q and A.  ", "Looking at the details on slide 10, you can see that the retentions remain high across all our commercial business.\u00a0\u00a0The only exception is our international operations, where retention was down from last year due to competitive market conditions impacting our Lloyd\u2019s business and the intentional nonrenewal of certain property business in Canada.", "The renewal price change data reflects both rate and exposure changes.  Underlying rate changes were consistent with and, in some cases, modestly improved from last quarter.  In the aggregate exposure change, which fundamentally measures our account insurable interests, was also consistent.  ", "We are seeing in a few of our businesses signs of a contracting of economic environment.  For example, in owneroperated commercial trucking, we've seen an increase in business failures.  In our construction book, although account retentions and new business opportunities have been strong, payrolls are declining.  So, overall, a very stable renewal book of business.", "Slide 11 shows that our new business dollars are essentially flat last quarter.  As we have talked about in previous quarters, the overall flow of new business opportunities has been up in nearly all our businesses and that trend continues this quarter.  For example, flow to our small commercial platforms increased 78% over 2006, while several of our middle market businesses have seen a 50% increase in submissions over the last two years.", "Some of the middle market increase in this quarter is attributable to volatility among certain carriers, but most is consistent with the positive trends that we've been seeing over the last several years.  Our new product offerings, platform enhancements, and strong positioning with agents and customers are driving these opportunities.  This level of deal flow is a clear competitive advantage for the company.", "As we have previously discussed, pricing on new business continues to gradually deteriorate.  As a result, our hit ratio, or the percentage of these quotes that we're writing, has declined.  This demonstrates that in light of the pricing deterioration, we have maintained our underwriting discipline focusing on insuring new business that meets our criteria.  These dynamics, that is, significantly increased deal flow with a lower hit ratio, resulted in a slight increase in net written premiums and business insurance segment and you can see the details on slide 12.", "Slide 13 shows operating income and combined ratios for business insurance.  The adjusted combined ratio was 92.7 for the quarter, 2.3 points worse than the third quarter last year, but still at a very healthy level.  The margin compression is due to the modest decline in pricing and modest increase in loss trends that we had expected.", "The atypical property loss activity, which we had seen in the first two quarters, returned to normal levels this quarter.", "On the expense side, after considering the [wind pool] assessments from Hurricane Ike and the timing impact of the agent compensation, our expense ratio is consistent with previous quarters.  Overall, we continue to have very solid margins.", "Turning to financial, professional, and international insurance on slide 14, premiums were down slightly, minus 2% from last year's quarter.  The adjusted combined ratio was a solid 93.8%, but has deteriorated 4.2 points from the same quarter last year.  This variance is primarily attributable to a small number of thirdquarter large losses that exceeded expectations in Lloyd's as well as developments on large losses that occurred in the first half of the year.", "Although the large loss experience continues to run ahead of normal levels, the activity did mitigate in the third quarter.  Additionally, I would note that the surety and professional liability loss ratios were on plan and none of the deterioration is from these businesses.", "A brief comment on the quarter's storm activity, estimates of CAT losses are detailed in the appendix and are obviously dominated by losses from Hurricane Ike.  Our losses for all these storms were consistent overall with our risk models, our market shares, and assumptions used in our pricing.  For a little added context, our Hurricane Ike loss assumes a $3.5\u00a0billion event per the Texas Wind Storm Insurance Association.", "In summary, we believe our commercial segment performed well and our results remained extremely solid.  With that, let me turn it over to Joe Lacher for the Personal Insurance results.", "Joe Lacher", "As Brian mentioned, our results have exhibited a great consistency in recent quarters.  We believe this comes from a focused execution on the key success drivers in our business.  I would like to spend a few minutes reviewing how this played out in Personal Insurance starting on page 15.", "We reported an operating loss of $64\u00a0million in the quarter, which was down $340\u00a0million when compared to last year's third quarter.  Cash for the activity represents $292\u00a0million of this decrease.  We also experienced a decline in net investment income of $20\u00a0million.  As you can see on page 15, our expense ratio in the quarter was 35%.  The increase of 7 points versus third quarter of 2007 was driven by a couple of nonrecurring things.  ", "First, about 5.5 points relates to hurricanerelated assessments that flowed through taxes, licenses, and fees and ultimately the expense ratio.  Second, just under 1 point relates to the accounting impact of our supplemental commission program.", "Outside of all of these items, our results are consistent with prior quarters.  You can see this from looking at the change in invested combined ratio for the quarter and yeartodate.", "Turning to our production results, written premium was up 5% in the quarter, a bit above the 3% growth level seen yeartodate.", "Switching to page 16, let's look at some of the more detailed production statistics.  Our property business has been a machine that continues to crank out results despite difficult market conditions.  With the broad slowdown in home sales and a tighter credit market, we would typically expect pressure on the property production.  Against this headwind, policies in force grew 3%, new business volumes were up nearly 7% versus prior year quarter.  Our retention at 86%, renewal price change of plus 6% were strong and consistent with prior quarters.  ", "We remain pleased with the continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volume.  Quantum Home policies now represent more than 12% of our policies in force.", "We're similarly pleased with our auto results.  Our leading product sophistication, our deep and expanding agency relationship, and our strong business platform continue to enable or deliver robust results.  New business volume was up nearly 13%, and policies in force grew 3% versus the prior year quarter.  Renewal price change increased from the second quarter to plus 3%, and retention remained in line with recent quarters.  Quantum Auto policies now represent more than 43% of our policies in force.", "Overall, we continue to make investments in our business infrastructure and distribution capabilities to fuel our longterm profitable growth.", "Turning briefly to page 17, auto loss trend results remain generally consistent with recent quarters.  Excluding the impact from the broader risk profile of Quantum, our total loss trend in the quarter was essentially flat.  Our frequency declined slightly, and our total severity trend increased slightly.", "Overall, we remain pleased with the fundamentals of our Personal Insurance business and look forward to building on that success.  With that, I will turn it back to over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Page 18 provides updated information concerning our guidance for the full year 2008.  We now expect fully diluted operating income per share will be in the range of $4.90 to $5.10, which incorporates actual yeartodate results and translates into an operating return on equity of approximately 11.5% to 12%.  We're assuming the continuation of current lower shortterm interest rates and the more challenging environment we experienced in the third quarter for nonfixed income investment return.  ", "Also, notwithstanding our financial strength and liquidity, we are planning for a reduced level of share buyback activity in the fourth quarter.  It feels prudent to allow for some additional capital formation in this volatile environment.  However, depending on market conditions and how our share price performs, we may change our plan.  This is not to be taken as a significant shift in our capital management strategy.", "Our guidance assumes fourth quarter CAT losses of $92\u00a0million pretax or $60\u00a0million after tax or $0.10 per share after tax; no further prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable; no significant change in average investment assets excluding FAS 115 and after approximately the $2.1\u00a0billion of share repurchases for the full year; and a revised weighted average diluted share count of approximately $610\u00a0million after the share repurchases and employee equity awards.  With that, let me turn things back to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Just one clarification in my prepared comments, please.  I made reference to a net realized investment loss of $133\u00a0million after tax.  That, of course, is the yeartodate number.  The number for the quarter is $116\u00a0million after tax.  I certainly didn't mean to confuse anyone.  So I am correcting that for the record.  With that we can open it up and take questions.", "QuestionandAnswer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from Josh Shanker  Citi. ", "Josh Shanker  Citi", "Back before the merger of Travelers and St. Paul, St. Paul had a reputation for writing some larger commercial business.  I am wondering, given what's going on in the marketplace, whether the new Travelers has this capability in this way and you're looking at what could be a market opportunity, what that means for you.", "Jay Fishman", "First, I will make an observation.  That may have been a reputation; I have not heard it before.  It's not a correct one.  St. Paul was a middle market and small commercial underwriter with a focus more on specialty businesses than general commercial.  But it was not a large account casualty and, frankly, when I got there, I am not even insure it had a national account property business.  That was not the case.", "As it relates to the company today, our sweet spot remains middle market accounts and small commercial accounts in the commercial arena.  We are not a large account casualty writer, broadly speaking that is.  The reason for that is that we find it difficult to understand how we can achieve a portfolio outcome when you are dealing with large account casualty business.  Risks tend to exist on an individual main basis and we struggle to get to a portfolio with that.  We do write large account property business.  ", "We're a significant writer of large account property business.  Of course, we do a fair amount of servicing.  A large amount of servicing for workers comp exposure to some of the largest, obviously, U.S.based accounts, workers comp being a U.S. phenomenon.  I don't think that we would change our culture and our DNA to embrace a line of business that we have struggled with.  ", "We don't dispute that other people have been successful at it and we certainly don't dispute that other people seem to have figured out a way to manage that business over a long period of time, but it's really eluded us.  It's eluded us for a long period of time.  So, we don't have a great focus of expanding our business orientation into the large account casualty world, particularly any more aggressively than we currently do.  Brian, do you want to add anything?", "Brian MacLean", "I will admit, I am also a little concerned when we broad brush where we are in the market.  So we do stuff for large accounts, but as Jay said, it's property, it's heavily focused on the casualty side.  On servicing, we take some risks.  In the aggregate, we are much more of a modest player there.  Our sweet spot is clearly middle market business and small commercial.  ", "Broadly, to your question, I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in the marketplace we go forward.  Many of which will be in markets and in products that we are very comfortable with and are anxious to look at and to look to expand.  We are not fundamentally looking to change who we are and venture out into things that are on the outer limits of what we excel at.", "Josh Shanker  Citi", "I appreciate that.  The second question, which might be for Jay Benet, might be quick to answer.  Any interest in expanding your willingness to take risk on the left side of the balance sheet?", "Jay Benet", "I will turn it over to Bill Heyman in one second.  I think the answer broadly is that, as I mentioned in my comments, we are a risk and return oriented organization.  To the extent that returns move to a level that make taking additional risks more appropriate, we are certainly openminded to doing so.  But it will always be done in the simple and straightforward way that we have so far.", "Bill Heyman", "I think notwithstanding all that has occurred in the market, as we look out across the opportunities we see each day, we find the market to be pretty efficient.  There are not a lot of free lunches being offered.  Obviously if we see one, we take it.  While corporate strength has widened, treasury rates, if anything, have stayed historically low.  Absolutely fixed income securities are, by historical standards, not very attractive.  We look at a number of asset classes where we have only toeholds and would like to get bigger.  They, too, have been priced pretty efficiently.  The other small bank loan portfolio and the bank loan market has been decimated.  A lot of the loans are credit one wouldn't want, even at these prices.  We are doing pretty much every day what we have done every day for the last five years.  See what comes across the transom that meet some absolute standards of risk and reward.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Gelb  Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb  Barclays Capital", "Jay, I had a broad question on the cycle turn.  I've heard some chatter among the reinsurers that the combined impact of AIG's dislocations and the broader financial issues in the market, plus catastrophe losses, are going to lead to a cycle turn in reinsurance as of 1/1.  Do you subscribe to that view?  I am not sure what your views are on the reinsurance side, but on the primary side you can address that.  Do you think there's enough capital that's come out to cause a cycle turn?", "Jay Benet", "Yogi Berra once said it's really hard to predict and especially so when you talk about the future.  I don't know.  I can tell you what our mindset is as an individual company.  How the overall market responds and how other carriers react to it is for them to speak to.  We're not a big enough competitor that any change that we take in the marketplace is going to drive the market in any particular direction.  We're approaching the world as a riskier place they than it was 12 months ago.  If you recognize that and you try and bring that philosophy to your pricing decisions.  ", "We're always going the support our agents and our brokers and our customers and we're going to compete.  We've done, I think, a very effective job at sorting through and finding opportunities that are priced appropriately, even in a more challenging pricing environment.  But we sit here as we do every month and think about pricing philosophy and it certainly seems to us to be a riskier world.\u00a0\u00a0We will try our best to bring that philosophy to our pricing decisions.  But everyone will have their own view and perspective and the market will be what the market will be.  I just don't know and I don't know.  My crystal ball isn't good enough to predict what's going to be in six months.", "Jay Gelb  Barclays Capital", "Then on the financial leverage side with debttototal capital being right around 20% and that being your stated goal.  Does that constrain Travelers from buying back more stock or is there a little leeway there to go higher on debttocapital?", "Jay Fishman ", "As I indicated in my remarks, we have a target range given our target of a double-A rating.  Somewhere between 15% and 25%.  We have never picked these targets either on the upside or the downside to be at a constraining level.  If we were to decide that it would be appropriate to increase leverage by a point or two or three, we certainly have to capacity to do that.  But we have been targeting the 20%.", "Jay Benet", "I would add one other comment to that because I do think it's relevant.  We try, because obviously the world changes around us, we have a fundamental philosophy of not running the company on the edge.  What I mean by that is not putting the company in a position from its leveraged capital perspective such that the kinds of events that inevitably happen in the property casualty industry in the ordinary course would cause us to have to do something dramatic.  ", "We want to be comfortable being able to withstand a quarter of Ike and Gustav and Dolly.  And we always remember that in 2005, it was Rita, Katrina, and Wilma.  The notion that we have capacity to lever up to a higher level, that may be the case, but as we think about how we run our business and the prudent management of longterm shareholder value would dictate that we shouldn't be running it on the edge.  I think where we are here is in a very appropriate level and it gives us the flexibility and the capacity to withstand the events that occur in our business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "One quick financial question then a broader strategic question.  Have you taken your full statutory dividend capacity for the year?  If not, how much do you expect to take in Q4?", "Jay Fishman", "We have not taken the full capacity from the operating companies up to the holding company through the first three quarters.  We do have a planned dividend level in the fourth quarter, but we're not straining the capacity to bring capital up to the holding company.  ", "We're operating the company as we said we have previously, establishing at the operating companies target levels of capital based on rating agency requirements, riskbased capital requirements of the states.  We are comfortably at or above the target.  Excess capital is swept up.  It's flowing and we're not being constrained.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "I was thinking the opposite.  I was trying to think how much you have used yeartodate just so I have an idea of, if I want to try to model it, how much holding company capital would be going forward?", "Jay Fishman", "How much has actually come up from the operating companies to the holding company?", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "Yes, yeartodate.", "Jay Fishman", "Why don't we have somebody else ask a question, and we'll give you that information.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "The broader question is just, there's obviously a lot of distressed properties come up for sale or may be coming up for sale.  To the extent you found something just incredibly compelling and the price tag were more than your current excess capital, obviously you have some ability to take the debt up, but you don't sound superinterested in it.  I am just trying to think how would you finance something that went beyond your current excess?  Would it be that acquisition is a compelling reason to get a little bit closer to the edge?  Is raising equity at these levels on the table at all or would it have to be just a supercompelling deal to do that?  Then I have a quick followup on that. ", "Jay Benet", "It is a supposition on top of a supposition there.  Let me go back and kind of reassert.  It's not any different today than it was three or six months ago, what our acquisition philosophy would be.  We think it's prudent or any management, every management to be aware of opportunities in the marketplace, to be knowledgeable and to look at everything they can to be aware of what's going on.  In our case, we don't need to do anything.  We have the ability to meet our mission, to create shareholder value by achieving midteens return on equity over time, with what we've got.  ", "The fact that we're a company that's significantly experienced in effecting acquisitions and effecting them successfully, I think we have a wellearned respect for the challenges that any trade brings about.  It brings reserve risk and people risk and culture risk and systems risk.  And you go into these things with eyes wide open with a really healthy understanding of what it takes.  Our willingness to go ahead and do something would only be with a mindset that something would be compelling in making it easier to meet our mission, easier to meet our mission of achieving shareholder equity with midteens return on equity over time.  ", "My presumption would be that any transaction that would meet that threshold that would be so compelling, it would be not difficult to finance it one way or another.  I think the more challenging issue is, yes, there may in fact be a lot of properties that come up for sale.  It's possible.  The real challenging issue was do any of them matter?  Do any of them make it easier for us to me our mission?  Once we believe that, then I think the financing ultimately stands on its own.  We know how to finance it in ways that are thoughtful.  ", "I think you get into trouble trying to finance transactions that you can't figure out how they actually add to shareholder value, and then you end up to some extent chasing your tail.  I would love to start off with an opportunity that's compelling, and compelling in a way that makes it easy for us to address the financing issue.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "I totally agree with that.  I guess what I am thinking is we might be in that special environment now where some properties you thought you would never see or if you had seen it pay two times book, maybe you can get them for a shade over book.  Just because they're subsidiary of their companies that have to raise capital.  To be honest, my main concern is, unless it was just an absolute steal, I would hope given where your stock is trading at, raising equity is off the table.", "Jay Benet", "We have a very healthy regard for the cost of equity.  We have at least a healthy regard for the cost of equity as any owner or analyst of our share price.  We get it.  We are all owners.  We are all option holders.  We all have a meaningful and significant stake in the company on an individual, as well as a professional level.  We understand it.  If anyone has any concerns that we have a disregard for the cost of capital, cost of equity, it's not us.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "That's what I wanted to hear.  Then related to that to finish it off, given that some of these opportunities may arise or maybe you just want to be more cautious in case the markets get worse or there's a CAT or something along those lines.  It would seem, frankly, the cheapest way of prefunding any of these concerns is to go buy more reinsurance, given you're taking your [retouches] up and reinsurance is still relatively cheap.  It's certainly the cheapest form of capital in the world today.  Are you considering as you go to 1/1 that maybe you start buying back down again in certain line of business to give you more capital flexibility for the unknown and whether it be a positive or negative unknown?", "Jay Benet", "We're, first of all, as it relates to our catastrophe cover, we're a July\u00a01 company.  Our CAT cover broadly won't come up until we get into the second quarter of next year.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "I was thinking more of the nonCAT treaties.", "Jay Benet", "The way, maybe we should challenge ourselves to make sure that the logic still remains in tact.  But we see reinsurance as a longterm cost rather than as a longterm profit opportunity.  If someone can find a dumb reinsurer and introduced them to me, I would be happy to make lunch with him.  My experience is that reinsurers are pretty smart and sophisticated and they know what their product is worth and they charge appropriately for it.  Ultimately, what we're doing is conveying the share of the profits of our business with a capital providing partner.  If we believe that, then what we want to buy is that which, when you think of your homeowner's, your automobile insurance, you make the same decision that we do.  We want to convey the volatility to someone else that we're not prepared to withstand.  ", "I think given our capital position, our earnings profile and our size, we don't have to worry about conveying more of that volatility to anybody else.  I feel very comfortable with our overall profile to the extent that we thought that some additional capital was needed, I think the kind of thing that we're doing in the fourth quarter, which you mean scaling back our share repurchases, is the least costly and least permanent way of effecting that.  If someone were to ask, why are we doing it?  I am not even sure I can give you a clear answer, other than to say it just feels right in these volatile times to allow for a little more capital formation rather than a little less.", "Ian Gutterman  Adage Capital", "Agreed.  To that point, since you bring it up, wouldn't it be a good trade?  It doesn't say the reinsurers are dumb so much, but wouldn't it be a good trade to buy reinsurance at a low to midteens cost of capital and be able to buy back your stock well below book, which is probably a 20%30% return on capital?", "Jay Benet", "Again, there's a presumption in that statement that buying back that reinsurance is a capital-producing event.  It may be a capital wasting event.  You just don't know.  Ultimately if you're buying insurance, then the coin is flipped.  Maybe it comes up heads and maybe it comes up tails.  Maybe the losses turn out to be better than you anticipate, and you've actually spent capital.  I just struggle with coming to the conclusion that reinsurance buying is fundamentally capital generating.  It may turn out to be, but ultimately if the reinsurer is doing their job well.  My experience is they do their jobs well.  The actuarial price that you're paying for it, is at least more than what it's worth. ", " I think to your point there has been a periodic tactic when reinsurance gets particularly cheap some people go out and aggressively buy more.  That's a tactical decision on the premise that the losses that you're avoiding are more than the premium that you are paying for the reinsurance.  That may or may not turn out true.  At least as we stand right now, it's not apparent to me that reinsurance is anything now but actuarially properly priced, not cheap.  I have some trouble getting to the conclusion that capital is created.", "Brian MacLean", "Just to finalize the answer to the question about how much capital was at the operating companies that could be brought up without regulatory approval, this is U.S.based companies, we disclosed in our 10K for the year that there was about $4,200,000,000 that was available to be brought up without regulatory approval.  Through the first three quarters of the year, we have brought up $3\u00a0billion of that.", "Jay Benet", "That's not $4,200,000,000, that's $4.02\u00a0billion. ", "Brian MacLean", "$4.02\u00a0billion.  Sorry.  You're absolutely right.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Newsome  Sandler O'Neill & Partners.", "Paul Newsome  Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Two quick questions.  One is could you talk about what the impact of the security lending program is on your investment income?  Was it really that material?  We are just trying to get my arms around this, not just for you, but for other folks who obviously do very similar things.", "Bill Heyman", "It was not material.  It was at its peak about $600\u00a0million in magnitude.  As we looked at it, our counterparties were people whose credit we were comfortable, but not too comfortable.  The collateral we were getting was acceptable, but not as good as we'd like.  After all that, we were taking a few basis points.  Earlier this year, we took it from $600\u00a0million to $15\u00a0million.  The only reason we left $15\u00a0million was we might want to get back into it again.  But it was never a material driver.", "Paul Newsome  Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Second question.  You recently sold this Union America to, I believe, a company that runs runoff operations.  Could you talk about how that affected your asbestos liabilities?  I know there are a billion in gross liabilities.  I don't know what the net would be or even round numbers.  Does this signal a change in your view towards trying to sell these kind of runoff companies?  I know Travelers was among the companies that protested for example [inaudible] sale of its runoff operations a little while ago.", "Jay Benet", "First, the operations were U.K. based and, as I am sure you know, U.K. transactions of this nature can be done in a way that limit the credit exposure of the company that is selling, receiving company.  In this case, we have the ability to X any credit risk to transfer the underlying liabilities to the buyer, obviously subject to the regulatory approval of the FSA.  We haven't closed yet.  We have a contract.  We announced that we have a contract.  We haven't actually sold yet.  I hope that we will get to a closing.  I don't think it speaks to a shift in strategy or policy.  This was a situation where runoff liabilities, and this wasn't enormous, it was sizable, but not enormous capture and attract capital.  They have to have capital to support them.  By conveying these liabilities to someone who views its as a going concern business and is willing to commit the capital to it, it frees up capital for us.  The underlying liabilities for all accounts reserved properly and appropriately.  It was an opportunistic transaction to move the liabilities to someone who would use it as a going concern, free up capital attached to that business for ourselves, and do so at a fair and reasonable price.", "Paul Newsome  Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "I think it's a good thing.  Lastly.  I was looking at a survey for the, telling us to put out D&O insurance.  That survey suggested that you folks were actually a leader in selling to financial institutions, D&O  insurance.  Is that true?  Is it that big a deal?  Maybe you could just talk about that exposure as well.", "Brian MacLean", "We certainly have a FID&O book and are watching that carefully.  Are we a leader?  We certainly are playing it.  The larger national levels, we've been managing that book carefully over the last year or so, looking at both limits and attachment points.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I think a key part of that is our limits profile and how closely we manage that.  Obviously we are limiting our exposure to any one.", "Jay Benet", "Let me make sure, I know I have garbled this up before.  Our bank exposure, not our financial institution broadly, but our bank exposure, is significantly driven by our community bank program.  So far, so good.  In that program, approximately 80% of the risks are private, these are nonpublic companies.  We actually have more of the characteristics on that.  The average size of the limits, it's not, the bank book is not driven by moneycenter banks, investment banks, banks that are actively engaged in the marketing or packaging of mortgage securities.  Again, there are other financial institutions.  There are insurance companies and there are a host of other things, but our banking exposure is driven by our community bank exposure.", "Brian MacLean", "I just want to clarify something that's related to the securities lending program.  You can get from our balance sheet how much of fixed maturity portfolio was subject to securities lending.  It is $15\u00a0million as of September\u00a030.  The numbers have been considerably higher than that.  The June\u00a030 number was $1.6\u00a0billion.  You can go back and look at what the values were in previous points in time.  We have, in this turbulent marketplace, really curtailed [inaudible].", "Alan Schnitzer", "The point is it was a very small amount of incremental profits.  ", "Jay Benet", "We viewed it as a conservatively run and managed securities lending program.  Didn't involve leverage.  It didn't involve further volume.  It was a straightforward, traditional securities lending program.  Bill actually came to me early, like in the middle of the quarter, and suggested that the ability to act on the collateral, given  the turmoil and dislocation that was then in the marketplace in particular could be challenging.  The collateral was okay, but if you had to act on it, it could be challenging.  Given the amount of income that it was contributing, Bill made an active decision to say let's bring the program down.  It was not a material contributor to our earnings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch", "Couple questions.  The first is, maybe for Bill Heyman, the change in the unrealized was frankly a lot more modest than we had expected.  Given what we've seen and what we did was we looked at different indices for corporate bonds, you know double A corporate bonds, and for even munies, and we came up with a much higher number.  You are not privy to our assumptions, but I am wondering if there was something about your business that allowed your unrealized losses to be a lot more modest than we have seen from others.", "Bill Heyman", "Actually we thought saw your estimate, although not the assumptions behind it.  When we saw that number, we felt better having seen your estimate.  I think we have tried in every asset class we are invested in to be as high up the food chain as possible in term of credit quality.  I think while we have to benchmark ourselves against indices for lack of anything better.  The credit quality, the real credit quality of the portfolio was higher than the indices.  I think that accounts for most of the difference.  Also, we missed some of the big blowups, and most of those would have fallen into the realized category.  But nonetheless, there's some credits which have gone down in price and may have got to the point of [inaudible] in which we're underrepresented.", "Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch", "The second question, maybe for Brian, in the nine months, the underlying combined ratio, X cap, X development, was worse by about 2.4 points.  So it's still a reasonable level.  I remember initially when you were thinking about 2008, I think you were thinking for that number to get worse by about a point.  Then you increased that a bit.  It does seem a bit worse than what you've been expecting.  One, is that accurate?  Secondly, if it is, sit more of a price issue or a claims issue?", "Brian MacLean", "Absolutely accurate.  Let me break it down into the three basic pieces and then Joe or Jay or anybody chime in.", "The core underlying assumptions around price loss trend, margins on the business have essentially played out as we expected, across I would say our whole spectrum.  This is broad brushing the thing.  You can look at our data, pricing has softened a little bit.  Pretty much in line with what we expected.  We expected some loss trend.  Our starting point, our base, has improved a little bit.  So net net our margins are about where we thought on the core business.  The large loss activity that we saw in the first half of the year in the commercial business, commercial property, running across all of our segments and a little more of that in the third quarter on the international side, is a piece of that number.  Then the rest is predominantly weather driven issues in personal insurance.  Again, we disclosed CAT.  So it's the nonCAT weather losses that we saw run through our personal books.  Those would be the major components of it.  The weather stuff moves.  Sometimes you have better years and sometimes you have worse years.", " ", "Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch", "So it's nonCAT weather basically.", "Joe Lacher", "The combination of nonCAT weather and the large losses that we spoke about in the first half of the year, to some extent.  Some of that continuing into the third.  Those are the two reasons.  You got it right.  You started out with anticipating 100 basis point deterioration in the combined ratio.  We took that up to a point and a half at the end of the first quarter.  Getting from that point and a half now to the 2.4 is largely accounted for.", "Brian MacLean", "Even a piece of the third quarter international large loss stuff was also weatherrelated losses that didn't hit a CAT threshold.", "Jay Cohen  Merrill Lynch", "If I could just squeeze in one more question.  If I can't, just say shut up.  On your auto business, certainly, there's a big property availability, AIG's personal lines business is for sale.  They've said that publicly.  You are a potential buyer.  One of the pieces there is the direct auto business.  You probably can't comment on this specific one, in general, how would you feel about entering a direct response auto business given the potential channel conflicts.", "Jay Fishman", "I will give it 30 seconds and ask Joe to comment.  We already do some direct business.  We obviously have for a while through our [inaudible] pity businesses and certain other direct channels.  We have also, in certain select states, been advertising in a way to drive some business directly.  Not a significant portion of our business yet, but already in place.  It's to your point, it's correct.  At least historically it's been described as a channel conflict.  ", "I think most of our agents and brokers understand the realities of what the business is going to look like over the next ten years.  They understand that and get it.  And what successful companies have done, and they're certainly are plenty who have navigated both of those tracks, have done so in a way that leaves the agents and brokers on a level playing field.  At least as we understand it, were that to become a more important part of our business, that's an important element.  You can't come to market and be adverse to the agents and brokers that have built your business.  You have got to keep a level playing field.  Again, independent of anything related to AIG, we've already been in the direct business to some extent.", "Joe Lacher", "I would echo all those thoughts.  We had a relatively significant percentage of our, not insignificant maybe would be a better way to describe it, premium that comes from nontraditional agency relationships for some time and continue to do that.  We work through all of the conversations with our agents if we bump into each other.  But we have an, unfortunately or fortunately, sufficiently a modest market share that those issues don't cause us a lot of problems and we figured out how to work through it this in a way that allows those channels to work together.", "Jay Fishman", "If we were to embrace the direct marketing strategy in a broader sense, we would obviously be forthcoming with our agents and with the brokers.  We would be forthcoming as to what we were doing and we would describe it in a way that enabled us to communicate to them effectively that we are, of course, protecting and watching out for their interests.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Alain Karaoglan Bank of America.", "Alain Karaoglan Bank of America", "I want to congratulate you on the great job that you have done on the investment portfolio, especially Bill Heyman, in avoiding so far some of the issues that have affected other companies.", "Bill Heyman", "Let me interject, the people in St. Paul, Minnesota, deserve congratulations as well, especially Dave [Roland].", "Alain Karaoglan Bank of America", "The question that I have relates to the surety and the D&O business.  I know you mentioned, Brian, in your comments that the losses are in line with your expectations.  How are you thinking in a weakening economic environment about contract and commercial surety?  What should be what we are watching out for?  Why shouldn't we be that concerned about it?  On the D&O front, are you expecting pricing to improve, given all the pain that has been there.  Just a numbers question on the tax rate on underwriting.  Was this lower than expected?  I calculate 27.8%.  I may have calculated that wrong and can pick it up be you Gabby afterwards.", "Brian MacLean", "Let us come back to the tax rate question, maybe Gabby can bet back to you unless there's a quick answer, but we'll look at that.  Great questions on the surety side.  Clearly we are looking very closely at that book as you all know, we are a major player there.  And have been a very successful one.  We have spent a lot of time talking about it.  Why don't I toss it over the Alan and let him bring you up to speed on our conversation.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I think the real important point to keep in mind on the surety business is this is something we've been focusing on for a long time now.  This hasn't caught us by surprise.  We have been looking at this and actively managing that portfolio, and our credit quality of our contract book as we measured it is at a high [inaudible] by historical standards.  We feel very good about that business and how it's performing.", "Jay Benet", "One of the things that we've done is to broaden out the imput into looking at the business and what we've been doing in it.  We've actually brought folks from Bill Heyman's organization and Bill [Hannon] who is our enterprise risk person along with people in the surety business now on a more regular basis to discuss in a much more robust way the overall credit profile and credit exposures and how they're being managed.  ", "I think part of this is to recognize that there is real strength in this organization to do credit analysis and credit evaluation and we're bringing all of those resources to bear into the business on a regular basis.", "Brian MacLean", "You also asked about pricing on the D&O book.  Obviously, when you write D&O in lots of lines and it's hard to generalize.  If you were thinking about the large FIs, the pricing has improved. ", "Jay Benet", "None of us mean to predict that there will never be a surety loss.  This is not to give you assurance that there won't be loss.  That would be in effect foolish, but I think we approach the business and the way that we do it in a very thoughtful way.  We're mindful of it and have a real healthy respect for the exposure that exists there.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Alain, I will get back to you on the tax rate.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brian Meredith  UBS.", "Brian Meredith  UBS", "I will keep mine to one question.  Jay, last time, last quarter you talked a little bit about inflation out there.  Looks like it's a little different environment now with oil prices down, commodity prices down.  Just curious, what do you think the impact of this current environment is going to have on loss cost trend?  What is loss cost trend look like in the commercial line area?", "Jay Benet", "There isn't anything that we saw in the third quarter that was in any way meaningfully different from what we had in the second.  If you remember what we said in the second quarter, was that while we were certainly mindful of the potential for inflation, we certainly hadn't seen anything at this point that would suggest any kind of a significant spike.  ", "That remains true.  We haven't seen anything that would suggest a real spike.  I do think in the context of, this is part of our responsibility to manage, in the overall environment.  We've got an existing deficit that's currently projected to get to half a trillion dollars.  We have got U.S. governmental making substantial infusions into financial institutions.  Its impact on the deficit, the dynamic of what a different regulatory regime will have, it certainly belongs on the list of issues for us to be extremely attentive to and thoughtful about.  I don't think that a reasonable person could dismiss it at this point a notion that the likelihood of any accelerated inflation, whether medical costs or otherwise, isn't a possibility.  It remains on our radar screen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Vinay Misquith  Credit Suisse.", "Vinay Misquith  Credit Suisse", "Could you expand on the opportunity that you're seeing right now since [inaudible] I think the most [inaudible].  I am curious as to what other opportunities you have seen in the market right now.", "Jay Benet", "First I would go back to even before this immediate quarter.  We have spoken for some time that in our middle market business, if you look at some of the middle market construction, and Brian mentioned this again.  The actual submission flow is up 50% from where it was two years ago.  That's just extraordinarily strong.  It really reflects new product development and the fact that we've become a really market of choice.  Two, is the advent of Travelers Express in our small commercial business, which is a real breakthrough in speed and technology in our smallest, small commercial arena, as also precipitated a significant increase in deal flow that [inaudible] we just haven't seen.  All of those things encourage agents to do more things with us that even extend beyond those two business lines.  Our experience has been the more you do with agents and brokers, the more business opportunities you see from them and that is partly what we are seeing.", "Specifically, in the quarter, people have asked if we have seen opportunities related to the situation at AIG.  I would make a couple of observations.  First, our sweet spots really only intercept to some extent.  You are right, we're not a large account casualty insurer, and AIG has certainly been one of the best large account casualty insurers in the world and deserve all the credit for really lending a successful business.  Where we do have some overlap is in our middle markets business.  They are a very good, very strong effective competitor there as are we.  We have since the dislocation related to AIG seen an increase in flow of opportunities to quote on business where AIG is currently the incumbent.  Our sense is that agents and brokers are looking for additional alternatives for their current AIG clients.  Accounts that might have not gone to market and simply been renewed, our sense is that agents and brokers are feeling something of a responsibility to their customers to generate alternatives for them and we have seen an increase in opportunities to quote on business where AIG is currently the incumbent.  To the extent it sits in our sweet spot in our middle market business we are obviously doing so.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from [Terry Shu]  Pioneer Investments.", "[Terry Shu]  Pioneer Investments", "I think most of the questions have been asked, but let me ask one more on personal lines, personal auto, specifically.  You have done really well and the industry environment, maybe you can comment on that.  Seems like many carriers are able to put some rate increases and right now, with the gaps that people watch, the underlying cost trends versus premiums has narrowed quite a bit.  Are we just seeing a much more disciplined market and you're gaining share mostly because there's still rolling out and you still have a smaller book and therefore able to gain share?  Can you just comment broadly.", "Jay Benet", "There's a couple of questions there.  I will try to hit them all and nudge me if miss some.  We are, as we observe rate activity, all of our competitors in a regulated environment would be put through filed rate increases so we can go through and see what each other have filed.  There's been a shift in the recent quarter and recent several quarters towards more increases rather than decreases.  I am not sure it's as broad as I sometimes describe it, but I think it's in line with what we're seeing in those same indices that you're describing that look at the aggregate results.  You can see it to some degree in our RPC numbers, our renewal price change numbers, which picked up again in the quarter.  I do think that's generally happening in the marketplace.  ", "Jay Fishman", "That's a little forwardlooking.", "Jay Benet", "Those are filed rate increases.", "Jay Fishman", "I am just trying to make sure people understand that dynamics.", "Jay Benet.  ", "That's what happened.  The question of is it a more disciplined marketplace?  That becomes the forwardlooking question.  And you start to say I don't know exactly what's going to happen.  We have had conversations about what were oil prices going to do.  What's going to happen with frequency?  How is that going to play out in the marketplace?  I think that, along with what's going on in the economy, will be somewhat unclear and we will have to see how that works over the course of the next couple of quarters.", "Jay Fishman", "The only observation there is that the first step is to get filings in place.  Filings actually sometimes translate to real increases and sometimes they don't.  What we look at there is what I would characterize as a leading indicator and it may or may not develop.  You're not declaring.", "Jay Benet", "I am just saying what we've seen in the observable data that Terry was referencing.  There's actual rates going up, rate increases that are actually charged.  We've seen our actual RPC, and you know the filings, that's will translate into actual dollars.  Who knows what's going forward.  ", "Joe Lacher", "From our perspective in our own business, we continue to I believe bring very thoughtful capabilities into the marketplace and we're executing them well.  We spent time before talking to you about our expansion of our agency plan into broader geographies.  That gives us the capacity with almost in a retail perspective, we're not just dealing with same store sales, we're dealing with new store sales.  As we open up those new stores, that gives us an opportunity to grow and outperform what you are seeing others doing in the marketplace without having to be unreasonably aggressive inside of those same stores.  We're seeing the results bear fruit.  We're confident that we can continue to march forward doing that.  ", "And I hope we get a little bit of the effect that Jay was talking about before, as we bring the strength of our Quantum products to bear, bring Travelers Express to bear, to bring the strength of our middle market to bear.  There becomes a halo effect of all of the things we do in place, propelling all of the things we do as a place to be more effective.  We see that in all of our businesses.", "Gabriella Nawi", "It looks like the end for this.  Thanks for joining us today.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Lacey. Good morning to everyone and welcome to the Travelers discussion of the fourth quarter and year-end 2008 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.", "With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, head of our Financial, Professional & International Insurance business; Joe Lacher, head of our Personal & Select businesses; as well as other members of senior management. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the following on page 1 of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of historical facts may be forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking, and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves, and other topics.", "The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website, travelers.com.", "With that, I will turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. We have a lot to cover, but I think it is important to put today\u2019s reported results as well as some of the other topics that we will be discussing today into the broader context of our organization.", "This year\u2019s performance is reflective of Travelers long-standing approach to managing risks in order to achieve our targeted results over time. I have said many times before that our fundamental business is one of managing the balance between risk and reward, both on the liability side as well as on the asset side of our balance sheet.", "What you see in our results today is an operating return on equity of 12.4%, and importantly, a four-year average annual operating return on equity of approximately 14.5% comes from this core cultural value and from as decisions we have made and actions we have taken or not taken over the past several years, not just this year.", "Looking back to what we said this time last year, we assessed the insurance marketplace more or less correctly. We expected it to be more challenging from a margin perspective, and it was.", "With that said, we are very pleased that our initiatives over the last few years have paid off, for example, an increased flow. We\u2019re also pleased that our metrics suggest that we continue to maintain our underwriting discipline.", "On the investment side, market conditions were clearly much more challenging than anyone anticipated. However, all things considered, I could not be more pleased with our performance and the position of our investment portfolio. We have received a number of questions in the last few months on how we are able to avoid so many of the investment issues which plagued the market this year.", "The answer is not that we saw everything coming. But in many areas, we believe that risk was underpriced. In that regard, we were fortunate. As I have also said if certain asset classes had been better priced, we would likely have been somewhat invested in at least a few of them.", "As it relates to pricing, I have noted in the last six months that the world feels like a riskier place. Recent data suggests that we may now be starting to see an improvement in the pricing environment. We are by no means ready to declare a bottom, but we like the data and we will discuss it in more detail with you this morning.", "On the investment side, we are still seeing a big spread between the bid and ask, but conditions in some investment areas in 2009 may provide more opportunities. Our results over the last few years have demonstrated a consistent and successful approach to assuming and managing risks in order to achieve an appropriate return for our shareholders.", "Nothing in that approach or in our culture has changed. I believe we continue to be well positioned to meet both the challenges and opportunities posed by the current environment, and deliver on our long-term strategy. While I will not go through the specifics of the quarter, I just want to highlight our strong results, superior returns and importantly increased book value in 2008.", "With that let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jack. Turning to page 4 of the webcast, let me start by saying that our investment portfolio, reserves, capital and liquidity continue to be in fine shape, despite the continuing turmoil in the financial markets. Our operating company capital remained at or above all of our target levels, our debt-to-total capital ratio of 19.5% was below our 20% target, the midpoint of the 15 to 25% range that arrives from our AA ratings target.", "Holding company liquidity was $2.1 billion remaining at almost twice our target of one years\u2019 worth of interest and dividend. This is after contributing $450 million to our qualified pension plan, which was funded at a 92% funding level at year-end.", "We have negligible amounts of debt maturing in the next three years and do not rely on commercial paper. Book value per share ex FAS-115 of $43.37, increased 5% for the year after purchasing over $2.1 billion of common shares and paying $712 million of common stock dividend and once again we closed the year with over $25 billion of common equity.", "On page 5, we updated recent areas of market disruption and their impact or lack thereof on Travelers. Overall, we continue to be unaffected in any significant way. Note that we have no direct investments related to the Madoff matter and are not aware of indirect investment exposures we may have based on inquiries we made of our fund managers.", "Page 6 shows a cap and net favorable prior reserve development continue to play a meaningful role in our quarterly results. Prior year reserve development favorably impacted our fourth quarter GAAP combined ratio by 5.1 point and a downward adjustment of estimated costs associated with current year caps, mostly related to hurricane Ike, which included the Texas Windpool assessment and hurricane Gustav, favorably impacted this quarter\u2019s combined ratio by 1.6 points.", "I would also like to point out that we recorded an $89 million tax benefit related to the sale of Unionamerica our UK runoff business subsidiary. The sale of Unionamerica also produced a small realized gain in addition to this tax benefit. It eliminated $790 million of net reserves, which included $265 million of A&E and it freed up supporting capital. ", "Ex caps and net favorable prior year reserve development, our GAAP combined ratio was 92.5% and we remain very pleased with the underlying profitability of our businesses. ", "Page 7 of the web cast shows the three major contributors to our operating return on equity. Fixing income NII plus interest on corporate debt remained the major driver. This passage of time component contributed 8.7 points in the current year, down slightly from the prior years, entirely due to lower short-term interest rates.", "A much smaller contributor operating ROE, but one that does vary from period to period is non-fixed income NII, which contributed a negative 0.6 percentage points this quarter, due to the difficult investment marketing conditions we faced as compared to a positive 1.4 to 1.6 points in prior years. And underwriting contributed 4.3 point for the year below the last two years due to the high level of weather-related losses.", "Cumulatively from January 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.5%, consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE.", "The fourth quarter net investment income of $438 million after tax as shown on page 8 was down significantly from recent quarters. The after-tax yield on our fixed income portfolio was 3.7%, consistent with prior years. That is the long-term fixed income portfolio, while the short-term portfolio yielded 1.1%, due to the actions taken by the Feds to lower short-term interest rates.", "The non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 14.9%, giving back a third of its 2007 NII, as private equity real estate partnership and hedge fund evaluations were impacted by the challenging financial markets.", "Consistent with our practice, we were diligent in updating our non-fixed income returns through December 31, despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results. Accordingly, our fourth quarter non-fixed income portfolio loss of $164 million after-tax included $56 million of after-tax losses that were reported, based upon information requested by us and recently made available to us by certain of our investment managers.", "As you will see, in our guidance, we are hoping for considerable improvement in our non-fixed income returns in 2009, but fully realize that they will be subject to evolving market conditions.", "The composition of our $71 billion investment portfolio remains unchanged from recent periods. At year-end fixed income comprised 94% and non-fixed income 6% of the portfolio. The quality of our fixed income portfolio remains at AA+. Its duration was 4.2 and the below investment grade portion was only 2%.", "And given movements in treasury rates, credit spreads, and equity markets doing the quarter, our after-tax net unrealized investment losses were reduced to $144 million at year-end, an improvement from $818 million at the end of the third quarter.", "Our investment portfolio remains well diversified across industries, investment types and individual issuers.", "We continue to apply very rigorous processes to identify investments for which write-down should be made. So during the fourth quarter, we recorded net realized investment losses of a $138 million after-tax, including impairment of a $129 million after-tax, bringing full year net realized investment losses to $271 million after-tax, which represents a very small percentage of both our investment portfolio and our capital.", "The information that appears on page 9 is based on a schedule that will appear in our Form 10-K, showing unrealized losses on investments, which estimated market value is less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has increased from the third quarter. It now stands at $744 million, with the vast majority in this position for 30 days or less. While this still represents a small fraction of both total investments and shareholders\u2019 equity, we do closely monitor these investments.", "And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. To give some context to the business results, I would like to start by offering some broad comments and then address the business insurance results, specifically. Obviously, the economy is in a turbulent state. It has impacted our industry broadly and for many individual companies in a profoundly negative way. Yet, as our results will show, we\u2019re favorably positioned for and have effectively managed this environment, delivering positive results for our customers and for our shareholders.", "As an industry, we\u2019re sensitive to macroeconomic forces, such as decreased demand for goods and services and higher unemployment. These and other pressures drive down payrolls, receipts, and consumer and business spending, thereby limiting the overall growth and insurable assets and impacting insurers\u2019 ability to grow the top line.", "In addition, the current economic environment has also resulted in significant dislocation in the financial services industry, driving customers, agents and brokers to more strongly than ever consider the financial and operational stability of their business relationships, including with their insurance carriers.", "This flight to quality has complemented the fundamentals we have developed during recent years, including our broad risk appetite, underwriting specialization, ease of doing business and claim effectiveness. The resulting stability we have experienced has allowed us to focus on the consistency of our strategy, and to deliver superior products and services, as well as solid financial performance in these turbulent times.", "Given that context, let\u2019s review the details beginning with the business insurance results on slide 10.", "Business insurance delivered operating income of $619 million, compared to $729 million in the same quarter last year. The combined ratio, as adjusted on the page, was 93.2 for the quarter, a deterioration of 1.8 points from the fourth quarter last year, and still at a healthy level. The deterioration is primarily due to the earned impact of the modest rate decreases and loss inflation we have experienced throughout the year, as well as some large loss activity, which in the fourth quarter was again above normal levels.", "Net written premium, as shown on slide 11, declined slightly or 1% overall from the fourth quarter of 2007. The overall economic contraction is affecting the top line of all of our businesses, but most dramatically construction, builders risk policies and inland marine, large property accounts and the trucking business. So given the impact of the environment, we\u2019re very pleased that in the aggregate we have basically flat top line.", "As we look at the production details on slide 12, we can see how we have been able to maintain level premiums in a contracting economy. First, retention remains high across all our domestic commercial businesses, and has increased to 88% in Commercial Accounts, our core middle market unit.", "We have been speaking all year about the importance of high retention, and these results are a direct outcome of our conscious strategy to maintain stability across a variety of marketplace conditions and are a critical factor to our success in today\u2019s environment. They also speak to the flight to quality dynamic and the value of our product, services and brand in the marketplace.", "Looking at renewal price change data for the BI segment, you can see that the change is generally consistent with recent quarters. But this data is not total price change and we thought this data is total price change and we thought it was important this quarter to look at the components of the change, to see what is really going on with pricing.", "So on slide 13, we graphed the two components of price change. That is rate and exposure. And here we see two distinct trends that essentially net out in the RPC. That is for us, rates have been generally improving over the last four months, while exposures have been generally declining. So although premium is relatively flat, all other things being equal, our margin picture is improving.", "The magnitude is different by customer group or line. In businesses like National Property, the shifts have been significant with rate change improving dramatically in recent months, while in Commercial Accounts rate improvements and exposure declines have been more moderate but steady.", "Even in small commercial, which is not shown on the slide, we\u2019ve seen a shift with marginal month-over-month improvement in rate change and offsetting deterioration in exposure growth in each of the last four months. Obviously, three or four months of activity is not enough to declare a change in the market, and we always remind you that we don\u2019t have a crystal ball on where things are going, but the run rate for these measures has clearly shifted since September.", "Turning to slide 14, the amount of new business written, in aggregate, is down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2007. In select, our small commercial business, new business in the second half of the year increased as the result of the product and platform expansion we have spoken to you about in the past. Across our other domestic commercial businesses, new business dollars are down or flat, reflecting the current economic environment and competitive new business pricing dynamics.", "In analyzing new business, it is important to speak to the new business opportunities or flow of new business that we see. Flow statistics were up in nearly all of our businesses this quarter. This increase follows the trend we\u2019ve been seeing throughout the last two years and is the result of both our strategy to drive more opportunities across all our businesses, and the flight to quality we\u2019re seeing in the market place.", "Some of the quarter\u2019s increase in flow is attributable to other carriers\u2019 instability but most is a result of our new product offerings, platform enhancements and strong positioning with agents and customers. Even though we\u2019re seeing strong new business deal flows, the new business pricing environment we have to compete in, remains very competitive. We have been rigorous in adhering to our underwriting standards and therefore our hit ratio or the percentage of quotes that we are writing has declined.", "As we have previously emphasized on both new and renewal business, we are maintaining our disciplined underwriting standards. So in the aggregate we\u2019re very comfortable with the quality of business we\u2019re writing.", "So, overall in the business insurance segment, basically level top line, and solid margins. And in these market conditions this is a result we are very pleased with.", "With that, let me turn it over to Alan Schnitzer for the financial, professional and international insurance results.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Turning to slide 15, in the financial, professional and international insurance segment, operating income was a $154 million for the quarter, as compared to $184 million in the prior year. The adjusted combined ratio for the quarter was 92.4%, up 2.7 points from the fourth quarter of last year.", "The primary driver was a small number of large losses in the international business, although, our large loss experience has improved from prior quarters.", "Net written premiums in the quarter declined 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007. In bond and financial products, the decrease in net written premium is primarily due to lower volumes in the surety business. In international decrease resulted from foreign currency translation.", "Turning to slide 16, in our management liability business in the quarter, retention remained high and consistent throughout the year. Renewal price change was slightly positive at 1% all attributable to rates and new business was strong. The new business gains were driven by an increased flow of new opportunities from a flight-to-quality in the public company liability business, partially offset by decline in new business in our financial institutions book, due to disciplined underwriting.", "In the international business, retention was at 76% in the quarter, down both year-over-year and over recent quarters, primarily due to intensive underwriting actions. The rate in the quarter was flat after 8 quarters of negative rate change and other RPC was a positive 6%.", "This time last year, we provided you with information about what we termed as sub-prime exposure. Over the course of the year, we have broadened the scope of our attention beyond sub-prime to include management liability exposure, arising out of the disruption in the financial markets more generally.", "Starting on slide 17, I would like to provide you with an update. We have consistently focused on building a well-diversified portfolio, management liability products, sold through various business units. We believe that this diversification and more specifically, the lack of over concentration in any one area, such as large publicly traded financial institutions, provides substantial mitigation against shock coming from events, such as the financial market disruption we have all seen over the past year.", "As you can see, we write approximately $1.6 billion of management liability premiums. In the current economic environment, many of these liability products are certainly subject to some level of increased exposure.", "We have broken down our management liability exposure into four product groups: DNO, ENO, fiduciary liability and other. And we have identified the amount of premium within each product group that we estimate is subject to a significant elevation of exposure, emanating from the financial market disruption.", "We estimate that the written premium from accounts at elevated risk as a percentage of our overall management liability portfolio is a modest 17% as a percentage of Traveler\u2019s overall gross written premium it is only about 1%.", "Turning to slide 18; it is important to consider the specific characters of these products and our disciplined approach to underwriting. DNO, ENO and fiduciary coverages are written on claims-made forms that contain defense costs within policy limits. Policies with elevated risk levels contain limits that are generally low, between $1 million and $25 million. But more importantly, average approximately $4 million.", "These policies are about evenly split between primary and excess coverages. Average attachment points for excess are relatively high at $46 million for DNO loan and $37 million when including fiduciary ENO. The larger account excess coverages comprise approximately 70% of the total.", "Please also note that we continue to use reinsurance to further mitigate portfolio risk. Our current analysis of 2008 claims, indicates little chance that we will approach the $375 million recovery cap. For 2009, we have revised our treaty to respond to frequency more than severity.", "On slide 19, I would like to walk threw the actions we have taken over time to address our potential exposure to financial market disruption. Since the first quarter of 2007, we have been proactively incorporating the financial market environment into our underwriting discipline.", "As we told you last year we conducted an individual account analysis on all accounts which reported claims, and for those individual accounts that we felt had a high level of exposure. The scope began with the accounts that included credit-related announcements or individual accounts with elevated risk characteristics, such as financial institutions, subprime lenders, bond insurers and home-builders and suppliers.", "Throughout 2008 on a monthly basis, we continue to update the analysis and expanded the scope to add more focus on community banks and consider exposures related to the Madoff matter. So, we continue to monitor the situation closely and revise our underwriting accordingly.", "Considering our diverse book and the way we have approached the market and managed our exposure, we expect that any potential issue would likely be a more manageable issue of frequency not severity.", "On slide 20, let me tell you how all this translates into our results. In case of claim notices arising out of financial market disruption reported in 2008 was consistent with 2007. With average limits and excess attachment points slightly more favorable in 2008, as compared to 2007.", "Our estimate of financial market disruption losses for 2007 improved from last year to this year, and excluding our exposure to the Madoff matter, our estimated losses for 2008 is consistent with our current estimate of losses for 2007. Although, it is early days of the firms and individuals identified publicly as having exposure to the Madoff matter, we have identified accounts in our management liability business with total exposed limits of approximately $150 million, net of reinsurance.", "We currently estimate that our actual aggregate losses from the Madoff matter, including accounts not yet identified, will be less than $75 million pre-tax, or $50 million after-tax. Some of which we recorded in 2008, and some of which we will record in 2009.", "We\u2019ve recognized estimates for financial market disruption and Madoff losses in our 2009 guidance. After considering all the items I mentioned, we expect our management liability business will remain profitable, as it was in 2008 and 2007.", "With that, let me turn it over to Joe for a discussion of personal line.", "Joe Lacher", "Thanks Alan. Personal Insurance had a good quarter, strong earnings, growth and policies in force. Business continues to demonstrate the sound fundamentals.", "Looking at page 21, you can see that operating income is up $25 million, compared to the fourth quarter of 2007, driven primarily by favorable cat results and offset by unfavorable net investment income. The fourth quarter had a favorable GAAP combined ratio of 85.6%, versus fourth quarter 2007 of 90.8%. Our expense ratio decreased one point in the fourth quarter 2007, primarily driven by a favorable adjustment to our estimate for the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association losses from Hurricane Ike.", "Adjusting for cats, prior year development, and current year re-estimation our adjusted combined ratio is slightly better than last year. Overall, a written premium increased 4%, despite challenging market conditions. As you can see from our production results on page 22, we continue to see solid business statistics in both auto and property.", "Looking specifically at property, production results for the quarter were strong, with policies in force increasing 3%, retention stable at 86% and a consistent renewal price change of plus 6%.", "Homeowners new business is somewhat related to home sales. Against the backdrop of significantly declining home sales, we remain very pleased with continuing growth of the Quantum Home product and its ability to increase new business volumes. Quantum Home policies now represent more than 13% of our policies in force.", "Shifting to auto, you can see that our production results remained solid. We continue to see increasing pressure on new business in the marketplace, but our renewal price change increased 4%, retention remained in line with prior quarters. Policies, in force, grew 2% over the fourth quarter 2007, with new business premiums up slightly.", "Our combined ratio for the quarter was 100.1% or 5.3 points higher than the fourth quarter of 2007. This is driven by a difference in prior period development, and after normalizing for this prior period development, the combined ratio was consistent with the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Page 23 provides a view of our auto loss trends. As you can see, total auto loss trends continue to be relatively flat in the quarter. Severity trend was slightly increasing and was offset by decreased frequency. While the marketplace remains competitive, we\u2019re seeing some increasing signs of firming, particularly in the auto line.", "We\u2019re continuing to monitor loss trends, profitability, marketplace conditions as well as the changing economic climate and will appropriately adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with the growth of our business, its underlying performance and look forward to building on that success.", "With that, I will turn it back over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Joe. Pages 24 and 25 set forth our guidance for 2009 along with certain supporting information. We\u2019re projecting fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, which should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 10% to 11%.", "Our guidance assumes cat losses of $360 million after-tax or $0.62 per diluted share. No prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable. A 2.4% non-fixed income portfolio yield. $1 billion of share repurchases, which would be a reduction from recent years, reflecting potential investment returns, and more properly reflect risk along with the uncertain economic conditions that all businesses face rather than a shift in our capital management strategy. No significant change in average invested assets, ex FAS 115 and a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 585 million shares after share repurchases and employee equity awards.", "With that, we will open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, our first question will come from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, good morning. I had a question on the guidance. Jay, could you give us a bit more insight in terms of your comfort level with the 2.4% return on the non-fixed income portfolio, and Travelers is in my view probably be one of a very few property casualty insurers that will be buying back stock in 2009. Can you talk about your comfort level there as well?", "Jay Fishman", "", "First with respect to the investment yield, the reason that we provided it, obviously, is because of the uncertain environment that we are in. And one can be more optimistic or more pessimistic, and this really ties to our budget for the year and it is premised on a real estate portfolio for which we continue to collect rents, that will provide a positive return that\u2019s offset by what I would characterize as a fairly nominal return in the rest of the alternative investment portfolio. So it is a blend. But it does not assume obviously in the aggregate of continuation of what we saw in the fourth quarter. But one can obviously have a different view, which is why we decided to provide the number more specifically this year.", "Jay Benet", "You want me to cover the share repurchase?", "Jay Fishman", "Sure.", "Jay Benet", "As far as the share repurchases, as we said before, we manage our capital beginning with the operating companies and our operating companies are very well capitalized. So, we look at things that we will impact that and we have got earnings projections, we have got moving dividends out of the operating companies up to the holding companies. We have got what we think is generation of excess capital in the place and we are going to prudently manage it.", "We are saying that the million dollars of buybacks, which is --it\u2019s not \u2013it shouldn\u2019t be viewed as plan. We are going to execute based on what market conditions look like and we are going to execute based on what opportunities look like to invest in our investment portfolio, as I said earlier. But for the purposes of guidance and the overall feel of the place, we will be generating excess capital to the extent we don\u2019t have the investment opportunities and everything else, including liquidity and having the appropriate capital cushion to cover it, we will return it to share holders through buyback.", "Jay Fishman", "And Jay, just to add a bit to that comment, if possible that investment yields become more appropriately reflective of risk in 2009, and there is a consequence, the alternatives for buying back shares may become more robust than they have been in previous years but I\u2019m certainly not making a prediction.", "In previous years the alternative was a relatively modest bond yield of 4.5%, even at its highest levels. And it is possible given the markets and given the credit markets specifically, that returns in other highly rated -- I am not speaking now about moving either down in credit quality or long in terms of return. I am really just speaking about more appropriate returns for appropriate risk assets for a property casualty company. They may be more robust.", "So one of our alternatives this year as we go through the year is to evaluate what is the best for providing shareholder return over time? If there are investment opportunities in the context of other fixed income instruments that are more reflective of long-term returns, we will do that. If not, we\u2019ve always said we would right-size capital and will return. I do think Jay\u2019s comment about being more reflective generally of a challenging economic environment is a real one. The last thing we would ever want to do, is to be buying back shares in one period, and then finding ourselves in a position of having to issue equity indexed. That is just a head scratcher for us. And so we are going to manage that just judiciously as markets involve.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. If I could just ask one more quick one. And could you update us on your outlook for the surety environment in a tough economic environment?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure Tom Kunkel is with us today. He is the CEO of our bond and financial products business. Why don\u2019t we let Tom take that question?", "Tom Kunkel", "Sure, thank you, Alan. The outlook for the surety business clearly there has been some level of drop off in public construction spending. We are looking though to see what kind of impact any public works program may have on -- what we\u2019re going to see for surety revenue going forward.", "As far as the condition of the contractors in our portfolio, clearly, I think, the larger contractors still have some pretty robust backlogs. The middle market people have seen some backlog shrink and they have seen some increased competition on bids. All that said, but the truth is, is that they\u2019re still showing the highest internal credit scores or near the top, that we have actually had.", "And in addition to that, I would say that, our underwriting continues to be very robust, we are doing comprehensive financial analysis. We\u2019re investigating credit relationships. We are closely monitoring new projects that are acquired and the margins that attained at and closely monitoring the progress of projects proceed towards completion.", "All those things said and done, we know management very closely in these companies to the point where we\u2019re out walking job sites with them. So, I don\u2019t think any one could say that we feel that we\u2019re immune to what is happening in the economy. But we do feel like our people are still very well positioned, going into it and being in the middle of this economy.", "Jay Fishman", "In the context of a loss perspective in that regard, though, is a credit sensitive business, and it will likely show higher losses in a more challenged credit environment than it would have in a less credit-challenged environment. Tom, I think, is providing the perspective of an underwriting oversight and the way the business is managed, but recognizing that it is certainly a more challenging economic environment.", "Tom Kunkel", "Absolutely, Jay, it certainly is more challenging than it was 24 months ago.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Thanks and good morning. Just curious about your thought process and putting up about half of the policy limits from Madoff and what would have to change for that number to change materially in either direction?", "Alan Schnitzer", "We have gone through all of our accounts that we think have exposure to Madoff and we have identified the ones that we think are likely to make claims but haven\u2019t yet. So, I think for this really to change dramatically, we have to see accounts coming from a high frequency of accounts that we haven\u2019t yet identified as having exposure.", "In terms of the amount we have put up, obviously we have analyzed the claims. We have looked at the policies, and we have recorded the amounts that we think are likely to be paid.", "Jay Fishman", "I think the point there Larry is that it is not a 50% across the board assessment of limits. It\u2019s actually a policy-by-policy review based upon the claim and on the claim data and information that we have so far. There are going to be policies that will be exposed. There are going to be policies where there will be significant defenses. There are going to be policies that may not even be exposed. And so the number that\u2019s here is not a pro-rata assessment of exposure, but much more an account-by-account analysis.", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s right. And I think for there really to be a significant change from our expectation, we have to see claims from a large number of accounts that we\u2019re just not expecting claims from.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Great, fair enough. Follow-up, Jay, assuming that some of the positive pricing signs get some legs and the market were to continue to firm. There is always an elasticity of demand in the industry, and as buyers see their prices rise they tend to reduce their buying habits. Do you think, given the economy today that under that scenario, there would be a materially greater, let\u2019s say elasticity for a demand?", "Jay Fishman", "Exposure is certainly going to continue to be negative, I suspect. As we think by the way exposure for us means risk units for existing customers. And so if payrolls decline, workers comp premiums decline, that\u2019s a reduction in exposure.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Right.", "Jay Fishman", "If previously there were five trucks in the fleet and now they sell three, there is obviously less exposure. New business is impacted by new accounts. You are going to have a few things here. We\u2019re going to have obviously less business growth and arguably business shrinking, in that regard exposure will be either less than it would have been or perhaps even negative.", "And on the new business front, you\u2019re really talking about churn, moving of accounts from one carrier to another. That to me is a sort of a more predictable dynamic in that. That is going to likely continue. There is a flight to quality I think going on, and it would be not prudent to not anticipate declining exposure.", "I do think that as companies, particularly on the commercial side, and perhaps even on the consumer side tighten their belts you will see rising deductables, that circumstances that we have seen before. I don\u2019t know that we have seen, I have to go back and look. I don\u2019t know that we have seen declining limits.", "I think generally what we have seen is that people bought business in particular, is willing to self insure more at the bottom than they are to buy less at the top. But so, you\u2019re trading, working layer-oriented exposure, in that case, and its impact on profitability less than if it was at the top of the profile so to speak.", "But I would certainly anticipate declining exposure and rate will see. The last three or four months have been encouraging and we will have to wait to see what happens.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "But I guess just in terms of relative to historical cycle hardening, would you expect these trends to be much more pronounced given the economic climate today?", "Jay Fishman", "I am not answering, candidly I don\u2019t know. I am not sure that we have seen a circumstance before of the combination of as you describe it your words now, not mine, a hardening market, and a declining economic environment. The last couple of times that we have faced changes in cycles, they have been in some relatively robust economic times.", "And so we are at least from my experience going back into the \u201890\u2019s, I think this is somewhat unchartered and I just don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t have an experience to look back to and point to. I have said before that I think that that there are plenty of good reasons to believe that the cycle behavior has changed. We said that several years ago. I think the statistics continue to bear that out.", "If, in fact, rates beginning to change, you wouldn\u2019t have bet that that would have happened with retentions being at all time highs. Historically, retention has been much lower, I remember in the middle market again in the high \u201860s, before the market really began to turn. We have a middle market retention of \u201886.", "So, I think that this cycle has been and continues to be different, behaviorally different than cycles that we have experienced before and I just don\u2019t know how to answer your question because I don\u2019t have a basis to have a conclusion on it. I do believe that exposure will continue to go down. That\u2019s about as much as I see in a crystal ball.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "That\u2019s fair. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. It looked like there was an unrealized gain in the quarter after-tax of about $674 million. However, if you look at the AOCI line in your balance sheet presentation, it didn\u2019t change that much. It looks like there is some offset. I am assuming it\u2019s currency but could you discuss that?", "Jay Benet", "Yes Jay, this is Jay Benet. It is not currency. Without getting into the details of pension accounting, which as you know is very complex. The AOC is also going to be impacted by changes that take place in the pension plan, which are for actuarial purposes, not fully reflected on an immediate basis.", "So, even though we funded the pension plan to get it up to the 93% funding level, think of that as a change in cash to investment the way the pension accounting works. And then the unrealized loss that the pension assets experienced in particular this quarter, but for the year, gets reflected as a downward adjustment in the AOC to be recognized over time, as an actuarial loss in this particular case through the pension expense. That\u2019s what causing it.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then secondly, it is probably too early to even have a comment on this, but some of the claims that you have seen related to the broader credit crisis, is there anything to read into yet, some of the decisions that have, probably very few decisions that have come out on the trials or settlements related to these claims?", "Jay Benet", "I don\u2019t think so. I think it\u2019s little early for that.", "Jay Fishman", "I think it is too early to draw conclusions from that.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, that is what I suspected. All right, thanks a lot.", "Jay Fishman", "The only comment perhaps and this is anecdotal and not just kind of reacting to your question, I think that there tends to be an emotional reaction to these things that eventually works its way through. I am thinking back to the perception that option backdating was somehow going to be a very significant event in the D&O professional liability area. And so far, it hasn\u2019t.", "And I think you can look back over the last few years of several events where the reaction, the analytical reaction tends to be my goodness there is significant exposure here and yet when the cases come and the litigation begins, circumstances often turn out differently. I think we\u2019re here way too early to come to any predictions. But I just think back to how many conversations we have had over the last few years of issues that people perceive to be confronting the professional liability business.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Vinay Misquith with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Hi, good morning. With respect to your financial institutions, D&O, I believe you have around $274 million worth of gross written premiums in 2008. I was wondering whether you could give us the gross exposure that you have out there, and what level of reserves have you put on that?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I think the $274 million you\u2019re looking at is not just financial institutions. That is the total of the gross written premium that we have identified as having elevated exposure to financial market disruption more broadly. So, I just want to clarify that point.", "In terms of the gross limit you\u2019re looking for, that is not a number we have disclosed in the past and not something that\u2019s really I think is meaningful in terms of perhaps trying to draw the conclusion that you may be looking for.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Okay, and in terms of market share, what do you think market share for financial institutions would be?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Let me ask Tom Kunkel to answer that question, but I think the thing you\u2019ve got to think about though is, you had a subsegment of the financial institution market that has, our market share among the large financial institutions isn\u2019t all that significant relative to our overall financial institution portfolio. Tom, do you have anything to add to that?", "Tom Kunkel", "Alan, I think you hit the key point so before estimating a figure, you would say we\u2019re again just various aspects and highly diversified across the whole financial marketplace. So to say a market share really does lump everything together.", "All that said and done, you could say that possibly there is an 8% or 9% market share. But a lot of it is in community banks, smaller institutions privately held, you see some mutual fund business. So, it is really diversified across all aspects of that business and more so, that is a part of a more highly diversified management liability business across the place.", "Jay Fishman", "And I think important, it often gets I think confused but a meaningful position for us is in community banks and I\u2019m going to go back in my recollection is it is 85% privately owned, right? Only 15% of which are public institutions. We\u2019re talking about, my recollection was again, total assets of is a $5 billion or less predominantly in the books.", "And we were going back to an old webcast where we gave the information on this community bank business, but it\u2019s been our experience at least so far that these are institutions that are generally not exposed to the kinds of issues that many of these questions are directed to 87%, I have got the statistics here 87% have assets less than $1 billion and 11% from $1 billion to $3 billion.", "And again, 85% of them are privately held. The average limit of D&O coverage for that bank is $3.8 million. So, one of the comments that we have made is that we\u2019re not a severity book. We\u2019re not writing significant numbers of 50 or 75 or $100 million of limits where one account can become problematic to our results.", "Our exposure and we have said this before in the financial arena, it would change if in fact somehow the community banks broadly were dragged into the financial crisis. We don\u2019t see that happen. So, it is always possible it may but we haven\u2019t seen that happen yet. We have some difficulty perceiving the circumstances that that could happen.", "These are typically not institutions that underwrite securities. These are typically local deposit-taking, loan-making banks that operate, again very locally. So I think if you look just to the market share, can produce an inappropriate analysis of what our exposure to these events might be.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "Sure, that\u2019s fair. Just one follow-up, claim notices appear to be same in \u201808 versus \u201807. Just curious given your exposure to mostly smaller accounts, would it be fair for a person to think that in the first instance, the larger financial institutions would usually be sued, but then later on, you would have more of the smaller financial institutions being targeted.", "Jay Fishman", "I think the answer to that would be typically not. The first half correct, where suits tend to go is where assets exist and where there are deep pockets, and where the ability to martial class-action suits can produce a significant outcome.", "And so, I think you will see, obviously, an attraction of this kind of litigation to larger financial institutions. Many people will often ask who insures them. The answer, by the way, sometimes is in fact no one, or in fact no one in working layers. These are institutions that often self insure. Significantly amounts of DNO exposure and they buy relatively high up and this is not a universal statement", "But it is true that larger financial institution, the great big money center banks or at least the ones that used to be great big money center banks often self insure working layers of exposure. And it\u2019s not been our experience. Obviously, it can be different any given time, but it has not been our experience that litigation starts at higher institutions, and indeed, inevitably filters downs to smaller ones. That\u2019s not been a trend we have seen before, may be different this time but again it is difficult to attach the community bank business, not impossible, but difficult, to attach it to these circumstances.", "Now that\u2019s different from investment advisors, it is different from those institutions that Alan and Tom have spoken about. Let\u2019s say specifically in reference to the Madoff matter where we have a name and a policy and we have identified it and put it on the schedule. So, there it\u2019s different, but in the broader sense of the financial dislocation, we continue to feel pretty good that our exposure is diversified and tends to be of a lower smaller institutions.", "Vinay Misquith - Credit Suisse", "That\u2019s clear. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Yes, thanks I have a couple of questions here. First, Jay, the fact that you guys are looking to potentially buy back a $1 billion of stock. Does that at all indicate your appetite or view of some of the properties that are available out there in the marketplace? Just given the liquidity and excess capital that you have, I figured you would be in a pretty good position to maybe pick up some attractive assets.", "Jay Fishman", "No, it doesn\u2019t. It is a number to be used for the purpose of establishing guidance. We look at lots of things. Will Heyman looks at investment opportunities that come along in our asset portfolio. And to the extent that business opportunities come along, it would imprudent of us not to look and evaluate and consider. So no, it really is a number, a starting point, if you like, for the purposes of calculating guidance.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Great, and then to the next question. If I look at your guidance for this year, it comes out to be 10% to 11% return on equity. Would you view that is kind of a trough ROE going through the market for Travelers?", "Jay Fishman", "Well, I would hope so. I mean that would be a pretty good outcome. If you look at the bottom, again you\u2019re getting into sort of questions about cyclicality in debts and all the rest, the last time the cycle turned I think most people in the industry would have given anything to produce a 10% or 11% return at the bottom. So I don\u2019t know. I mean again it\u2019s a crystal ball question.", "All I can do is tell you that the rate data for the last several months has been encouraging and it would certainly be a nice place to begin to make a bottom, again with retentions at all time highs and with projected returns in that 10% to 11%, it would feel good to be making a bottom there if it happens.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Great. And then the last question quickly for Brian. You mentioned the hit ratios continue to decline here, although your flow is moving up. I am just curious, can you get into a little bit on why you think that is happening. Is it some of the struggling carriers out there, perhaps or getting even more aggressive in trying to retain business? Do you see any kind of shift in the hit ratios during the course of this year?", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s a function of two fundamental things. One is, there are clearly some distressed carriers out there and without question, more of their businesses in the market than would be traditionally so. So a lot of business in play, and they are doing the logical thing which is competing very aggressively to keep it.", "But we\u2019re getting our shot at reporting on it and we\u2019re writing some of it when we feel we can get it at the right rates terms conditions. I think the other thing is, we feel pretty confident about our capabilities in the marketplace, and so really starting over two years ago we started to see more flow.", "We have been much more aggressive in pushing out more products and being more proactive with the agents. And I think that\u2019s really made a difference. So, I think it is those things together that are driving the flow. And the market conditions are kind of as we just talked about.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "I mean, on the hitters when you\u2019re losing the pace of business, are you finding the Delta between your price and perhaps the incumbent carrier is getting greater, is it less, are you barely mission it or is it?", "Brian MacLean", "In general, it\u2019s not, barely missing it. I would say we win the jump off more often than not.", "Jay Fishman", "This is a bit anecdotal because we actually do keep track of hit ratios very precisely, what we don\u2019t keep track of because we don\u2019t always know. What we don\u2019t keep track of is the extent to which when we don\u2019t take business, whether we lost a price or frankly we lost for something else. So, what we\u2019re answering here is an anecdotal.", "In some cases price may be the same but coverage limits may be a lot higher. We don\u2019t know how to answer that other than anecdotal observation from what we\u2019re hearing in the marketplace. So our sense is, I mean marketplace meeting our own folks, sort of a reports from our own folks say when we\u2019re close, we\u2019re in there. And when we\u2019re not close we\u2019re not.", "Brian MacLean", "And don\u2019t take our comments to imply that hit ratio is plummeting. I mean flow is going up a little bit and hit ratio is coming down a little bit.", "Jay Fishman", "And again, forgetting about the hit ratio for a second, what I find encouraging is that this has been, in this more challenging market over the last couple of years, the product development whether it is Quantum Auto, Quantum Home, Travelers Express, the new products in middle market, these things have made a difference. They have clearly and we have seen it, they have clearly made a difference in the amount of business that we have an opportunity on which to quote.", "The more challenged competitive environment, and by that I mean, the position of certain other companies has certainly augmented that. It is very difficult for us to sort out how much is a result of our product work in development and how much is in fact the flight to quality, but it is pretty clear to us they are both working.", "And the notion that we could in fact see improving margins. And Joe by the way, made a very good point earlier, Brian, said improving margins from where they would have been if rate hadn\u2019t picked up.", "Brian MacLean", "Right.", "Jay Fishman", "That doesn\u2019t mean the rate in picture. That\u2019s right. The rate is still negative. We\u2019re still not above that zero line, but nonetheless, that rate line picks up, it is improving margins to where they otherwise would have been. The combination of an underwriter\u2019s willingness to be more aggressive in the marketplace because they feel better about the rate picture combined with that increased flow has the potential, no prediction here, has the potential of being pretty powerful.", "And that\u2019s exciting to us and we will see. Maybe it occurs, maybe it doesn\u2019t. But my comment about being well positioned really speaks to that. We\u2019re seeing more flow. We have got the things we need to deliver on it and as price changes underwriters\u2019 attitudes will also and that can be pretty powerful.", "Brian Meredith - UBS", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Matthew Heimermann with  JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Hi. Just two quick questions, if I may. First, on the FI or actually the way you term the high risk professional lines book. Can you give us a sense of loss ratio wise, what your booking it at in the fourth quarter?", "Jay Fishman", "I don\u2019t think that we have broken down loss ratio at that level. I don\u2019t have the data handy actually and I\u2019m not sure we\u2019re inclined to disclose loss ratio at that ground level.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Could you just maybe provide color because you made a big comment with respect to the whole book that you still expect the book to be profitable, I think you said in \u201809 in one of the comments in the press release. So, I just be curious whether or not that comment would then hold for the at risk book.", "Jay Fishman", "When we make that comment we\u2019re making a comment with respect to the portfolio overall and intentionally not breaking it out into any particular piece. And really the sense we\u2019re trying to give you there is that there are no shocks coming to that book and that will continue to be a profitable book as a portfolio. We weren\u2019t intending to give you a more granular, but I mean it is insurance in the following sense. Once you begin to identify the accounts that are likely to have losses, it becomes unlikely that, that book narrowly defined would be profitable.", "I mean ultimately insurance is a combination of those accounts that have losses, and those accounts that don\u2019t. And what you have actually just kind of asked is if you identify those accounts that you think are going to have losses, do you think that they will still be profitable. The answer I think is pretty obviously no.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Yeah, then I get the large numbers. I guess my question is to one thing we\u2019re all sitting from here is, it is one thing to say the losses in the financial institution book even if things go bad may not really be that material from an earnings standpoint.", "I frankly I would agree with that. But I guess the only thing I\u2019m trying to get that is trying to get a gauge of if I think there are going to be losses there, whether or not how big the Delta is me and you, either side. So, that\u2019s just what I am struggling with.", "Jay Fishman", "No, I mean I understand the direction of your question, and I simply come back to kind of Alan\u2019s comments. If you can take a look at the FPII business broadly, and the detail that\u2019s been provided here with respect to \u201808. And I don\u2019t think it is terribly difficulty to analytically make a projection on into \u201809. There is an observation in here that \u201808 claim activity was about the same as \u201807.", "We made a comment about how the \u201807 estimate has developed, short of saying that accounts with losses have losses. I think we have really tried to give you, not for the purpose of giving you information, but there is enough information here to have a view on how FPII would perform next year.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay. The other, just with respect to the Lloyd\u2019s business and I know the capital is moving around a lot because of the currency, but is that is a business where not as you think about allocating capital in \u201809 you\u2019re likely to increase your appetite?", "Jay Fishman", "If you\u2019re holding constant that the capital requirement from the appetite in the business, then I would say that you wouldn\u2019t expect a significant change in the appetite, may be we will pick up a little bit, but I don\u2019t think that we would expect the whole sale change there.", "Jay Benet", "I think the Lloyd\u2019s business just like all of our business is subject to internal capital allocations and the returns that we calculate based upon premiums and loss estimates going forward. So, we will factor in to those processes, whatever the costs are associated with it.", "And in the case of Lloyds, what we and other carriers use instead of part capital or letters of credit that support the Lloyd\u2019s business. So in our case, what you will see is a higher cost associated with those letters of credit. But again, it is all factored into the pricing line.", "Jay Fishman", "And I think that is the relative of the point, which is we\u2019re not capital constrained in any way, if there are business opportunities to write more business in Lloyd\u2019s at attractive prices. We can and we will. There is nothing that limits our ability to do more business, to write more profitable business there or frankly in any line of business that we have.", "We\u2019re in an unusual position, when evidenced by the share repurchases of actually being in a position where we\u2019re still generating excess capital. Well, if we can write more insurance business, we\u2019re all for it. We love the business. And if we can do it profitably and thoughtfully, we will.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then last one if I can sneak it in if just\u2026", "Gabriella Nawi", "Matt, you know what we got four more other people. So, can you take it offline?", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "All right, that\u2019s fine.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Good morning. There has been a lot of conversation by many of your peers about hiring teams that have a number of companies including AIG. But, I was wondering if you are participating in that process, as well as, so many of your other peers are?", "Jay Fishman", "There are certainly people from AIG who have joined us. There are people from other companies who have joined us. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re out hunting for teams of people to bring in teams of people in books, but we are an organization of 33,000 employees. There are always people from other carriers who come and join us. So I wouldn\u2019t, my answer to the question is yeah, we\u2019ve had people from AIG join. But I wouldn\u2019t particularly perceive that is hiring teams of people to bring in books of business.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Sorry, in the interest of time, because we want to get everybody in, just, if you could just keep it to one question and make it the one you really want the answer so. So Paul, I didn\u2019t warn you, so I give you one more, but then we got a couple of other people.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O\u2019Neill", "No, no. Go ahead with the next. I play nice.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you.", "Jay Fishman", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Our next question will come from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Good morning. I hope you didn\u2019t discuss this already. Are you seeing any changes in the frequency and severity of either uninsured or underinsured motorists who then personalize?", "Jay Fishman", "We didn\u2019t discuss it already. And, when you go in aggregate, not something that we\u2019re seeing is significant. When you get the individual local geographies, there are always nuances, but I\u2019m assuming what you really asking is, is there something related to the economy?", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right.", "Jay Fishman", "Which is causing there to be a higher number of uninsured or underinsured motorists in the environment, and at this point through our book, we\u2019re not seeing that. Is that \u2013 was that what you were targeting?", "Meyer Shields - Stifel Nicolaus", "That\u2019s exactly it. Thank you.", "Jay Fishman", "I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen going forward, but we\u2019re not seeing it, in our experience yet.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Joshua Shanker with Citi. Please proceed.", "Joshua Shanker - Citi", "Thank you. The question is that it\u2019s easy I suppose, but maybe a longer answer. What do you like in terms of the investment space and how much risk is appropriate for Travelers in viewing, suppose an investment corporation rather than an insurance corporation?", "Brian MacLean", "Well, I\u2019ll start with two observations and that is the first. We\u2019ve always believed that we are an insurance company, which invest its money, rather than an investment organization, funded by insurance premiums. Second, as we look at the landscape, we\u2019re looking to buy assets of the type we bought before, at better prices, rather than to buy assets that we wouldn\u2019t have bought before, and simply because they are now at lower prices.", "In terms of looking at risk, we think risk is a combination of price and reasonably expected scenarios. And simply because price is lower, it doesn\u2019t mean the combination has changed. And paradoxically, we could look at assets selling at much lower prices than they sold much lower a year or two ago. And conclude that, they are even riskier now. But that being said, we think there will be opportunities, believe it or not in private equity, although to capitalize on them, one will likely have to have commitments to funds existing now which we do.", "We think there will be opportunities in high-grade corporate debt. We\u2019re worried about, so-called distressed assets notwithstanding the rush into them because we think that corporate reorganizations may be very different, the lack of dis-financing maybe, the recoveries are lower, more companies are liquidated as oppose to reorganize. And the world that you enter when an obligation defaults maybe very different than the one you entered two years ago, when it defaulted.", "And therefore, we like not to experience that. We were certainly solicited by every opportunity fund in the last year or so and passed on them. They either performed poorly or grew up. I guess the short answer is we\u2019re going to do very much what we\u2019ve been doing, and just hope we get better prices.", "Joshua Shanker - Citi", "And no indications on which asset classes we should just be referring to, want to give us any idea?", "Brian MacLean", "I think you could make a case that every asset class is cheaper than it was. Our allocation is not likely to change a great deal.", "Joshua Shanker - Citi", "", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital. Please proceed.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Hi, everybody. I just wanted to ask a little bit more about the impact of the economy on both, your business and strategically what it might do to your competitors. I guess, I\u2019m thinking in a couple of areas. One is just, if there is less exposure in the industry and therefore less growth, but you have -- you still spend a same amount of time servicing account that would seem to cause some expense pressures for yourselves. So, how are you dealing with that?", "And then competitively, you\u2019re obviously faced with a large number of very small competitors. Could this be a crushing blow to them and that they can\u2019t -- the lack of skill they have already, does this make the scale benefit that you have even more compelling?", "And then operationally for you guys, how might we see, maybe as claiming behavior changes, maybe some of those truckers are facing bankruptcy and become more aggressive in their claims or maybe the automated underwriting box, isn\u2019t quite calibrated for a different economic environment, doesn\u2019t perform as well as you like. Are there things you\u2019re doing operational reviews to make sure the people at the field level are aware that, your business might respond a little bit differently than it would in a more normal economic environment?", "Jay Fishman", "I will take a shot at it. Let me and just to give everybody notice, Jay -- after I finish the question or we finish the question, Jay Benet is going to I hope provide some other insight into the bond and financial products loss ratio. Some of the questions, I think have been centering on this and there may be some confusion. And I think he can add some clarity to it. So, we\u2019ll get to that as soon as we finish.", "First, in the context of our own business, I have enough trouble figuring out what\u2019s going on in our own shop, forgets trying to figure out what\u2019s going on in other people\u2019s shops. But I can tell you in our shop that volume is up, not volume being written, but flow is up. And so, underwriters are busy. It is not as if the moment, we have a lot of excess capacity, sitting around in the field, waiting for something to happen.", "Universally, everyone I talk to in the field and the people I interact with are folks are reviewing accounts, they are out in the market, they are visiting with agents, and it\u2019s not a quiet time, at the instant. And that\u2019s driven again by our own product development over the last several years. And I think some of the competitive challenges that you see which have caused agents to shop certain accounts more dynamically than perhaps they might have in the past. That\u2019s pattern that we have talked about in the third quarter and it continued on into the fourth. ", "The claim organization is in fact, I would say busy, they\u2019ve got -- so there\u2019s still the [remnants] of Ike and Gustav and all the rest of the cat season that we dealt with this year. So, in terms of resources in our organization, people are hopping and there is not a lot of idle time.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "So, are they getting paid less dollars for the amount of work they are doing, just because if the account that might have 500 employees and now has 400 employees, they\u2019re doing the same amount of work, but less premium dollars associated with it.", "Jay Fishman", "Yeah, again, and this is an important thing to understand. As I said before, I would anticipate exposure continuing to decline. But remember that a dollar of exposure has lost costs associated with it. For instance, one of the great and in fact normality\u2019s of our business, if you lose $100 in premium with losses associated with it, you\u2019ve got business that\u2019s even on the margin in a 85 combined ratio, you\u2019ve got $0.85 in saved losses and 15 points in commission that\u2019s saved and premium taxes that aren\u2019t paid.", "So, the bottom-line impact of exposure, it\u2019s not zero, but it is not nearly as powerful as people think. And of course, you see that on the way up. When we add exposure, it doesn\u2019t change the bottom-line as quickly or as dramatically as some people think it will, the marginal costs for dynamic in our business is pretty high. Make a distinction between that and rate. Rate is extremely powerful from the bottom-line perspective.", "You pay 15 points round numbers of commission, and the rest falls to the pretax line. So a point of rate, quite, quite powerful in terms of profitability, a point of exposure, far less powerful in terms of profitability. So, as we look at the situation right now, and again, not forecasting, but what we\u2019ve seen in the last several months, is generally speaking improving rate and declining exposure, that remains pretty powerful from a margin perspective.", "Brian MacLean", "And some of it is, as Jay said, we\u2019re obviously speaking to our length. So, if you\u2019re a company that has got a significantly different as in lower retention experience than we have got, that pressure is going to be a lot more intense. But we are keeping the business that we want to keep and we have got lots of opportunities. And so, we feel pretty good about it.", "Jay Fishman", "And in the context of a recession, certainly we have talked this before, our trucking business is already reflecting declining volumes and some higher losses, and has for some time. That\u2019s not a new dynamic in our Northland operation. If you speak, very, very broadly about recessionary times, experience suggests that workers comp losses tend to rise. That is a phenomenon that we have seen before.", "And that may be, I said, I think about our book of business, the principal loss dynamic. Again I will put the surety business also to aside for a second because that has its own unique dynamics that can be somewhat more severity-driven. You can have an individual name obviously get into financial distress. ", "But if you\u2019re looking for a pattern, I would say workers comp loss is rising. We watch for that and try to underwrite to it.", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah, in consistent with Joe\u2019s comment on the loss trends of specifically the UM, UIM stuff, but more broadly we\u2019re obviously watching very, very closely our claim experience. We see little, but not dramatic impacts from the economy. We expect that they will become more dramatic. Many of those are negative. Some of them are actually positive. People drive less, etcetera. But we\u2019re watching closely, but there haven\u2019t been big spikes. Trucking is one where we have been seeing experience.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "I know we\u2019re out of time, but just quickly, is it easier or harder for you to identify those changes, and that after you do more automated underwriting. Does the automation make it easier to spot or does the lack of underwriters going scrubbing every account one-by-one and you don\u2019t get anecdotal information make it harder?", "Joe Lacher", "It probably makes it easier in the businesses where we\u2019re doing it because you can capture the data in a more consistent fashion, but it does make it different. I\u2019m not arguing that one is necessarily better than the other, but it does make it very different in terms of what you have to do to see it and spot it. Anecdotal information by its nature is anecdotal and colored and harder to assimilate rapidly and have a consistency to it.", "And when you\u2019re dealing with smaller accounts with a large, large numbers applies, that becomes very distorted. So, we feel better about it there. What you get in this and it is why we built significant product management organizations and a significant investment in our management information infrastructure is the ability to crunch all the data and look at it.", "There are different things, symptoms that push sometimes in different directions. As Brian points out, we may see less driving exposure in an auto environment. But over time, we\u2019re less likely to see less maintenance investment as people can\u2019t quite afford the brake job or the new set of tires. So that may push up, one pushes down frequency, one pushes up. They will come at different periods of time along that economic downturn and we\u2019re watching for all of those different components very carefully.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Very thorough answer. Thank you, guys.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. The thing I wanted to add some color to, just to look, to take some of Jay\u2019s comments about, if you look at businesses that have loss, of course, they have losses. And if you look at other businesses, within FPII in particular, because Alan had Tom had said, this is a very diversified portfolio.", "So we don\u2019t want to give the impression that when you look at FPII\u2019s combined ratio of 87.2, that that\u2019s uniform amongst all the different businesses within FPII. We certainly don\u2019t close our eyes to the loss experience of any one of these individual businesses. And what you\u2019re seeing in our numbers or potentially not seeing in our numbers is that.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "But we\u2019re seeing that you may not, you don\u2019t have access to.", "Jay Benet", "Is that when you look at things like the financial institutions book, the professional liability book, public company liability book within, I mean there are some higher loss ratios, combined ratios associated with those businesses that are being offset by very favorable results because of the lack of loss activity that is taking place in areas like commercial surety and construction services.", "So, this is all blending as Alan said to the 87.2. But we don\u2019t want to give anyone the impression that we\u2019re not fully looking at the loss experience that is taking place in some of these businesses.", "Jay Fishman", "The financial institutions portion of bonded financial products. Its combined ratio reflects the loss experience that we\u2019re speaking about here. So, does the professional liability book within bond and professional products. And if you\u2019re asking if those were profitable as I said before, no in 2008, those individual books of business within bonded financial products were not.", "But the commercial surety business was. The construction services business was. The private and nonprofit bonding financial product business was. So there is a big book with lots of lines and those two lines, to Jay\u2019s point do reflect the claims, experience and the adverse development that we anticipate in those lines. I think that will be helpful in understanding how the numbers roll together.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, that concluded the question-and-answer period for today\u2019s conference. I will now turn the call back over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi for closing remarks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you all for joining. And before we go, Matt Heimermann, I owe you an apology and you will get first call next quarter. Also, if you have any other questions, please refer to myself or Andy Hersom. Our details are at the bottom of the press release. Thanks very much for joining.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference. This concludes your presentation.

And welcome to the first quarter earnings review for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you may be given instructions for the question and answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Lindsey. Good morning, and welcome to the Traveler\u2019s discussion of our 2009 results. Hopefully, all of you seen our press release, financial supplements, and webcast presentation released earlier morning. All of these materials can be found on our web site at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "With me today is Jay Fishman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer Head of our Financial, Professional & International Insurance Business; Joe Lacher, Head of our Personal and Select Businesses as well as other business members of Senior Management.", "We will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. Refer to the webcast presentation as we go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward looking information which is found in Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than certain historical facts may be forward looking statements. Including our earning time maybe forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statement that accompanies results of operation, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserve and other topics.", "The company cautions investors that any forward looking statement involves risk and uncertainties and is not a guaranty of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K files with the SEC.", "We do not undertake any obligations to update forward-looking statements. Also, in response or remarks to questions, we may mention Travelers\u2019 operating incomes, which we view as a measure of profits and other measure that may be non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplements, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website at travelers.com. With that, we\u2019re all set. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, [Gaby]. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. In light of the overall environment and as it relates to investment performance, recalling that the SMP 500 index traded $6.66 shortly before the end of the first quarter. Our results this quarter were again, quite solid and our financial performance speak for itself in our release. Our management teams can speak to some of the detail in our businesses. And I'll just like to take a moment or two and give a broad perspective on our business trends.", "From an underwriting perspective, business insurance continues to gain momentum. First quarter data continues to show an improving price trend. And we\u2019ve also seen a continuation of the opportunity we\u2019ve had to quote on more new business, driven we believe, by a flight to quality. It is particularly noteworthy that in this quarter we have been more successful at converting the slow (inaudible) business. And Brian will speak to that important dynamic.", "Exposure continues to decline. We suspect this as a direct result of the weakening economy. And we\u2019re appropriate on our part to discipline under riding given general economic conditions. Not withstanding several quarters now of improving rate trend, we are mindful of cost pressures that all businesses have so we will watch and wait information carefully quarter-by-quarter to see how it goes and refrain from making predictions.", "On the personal lines front, during the quarter, we announced our effort to launch a direct to consumer initiative leveraging the Travelers\u2019 brand. There\u2019s been much work to get to this point. The development of Quantum, in addition to allowing us to offer a best in class product to independent agents was critical in giving us a product that can compete with the best direct riders.", "In order to make quantum successful, we also needed to invest and develop acquaint capacity that could serve as a broad array to all our customers. Lastly the development of Quantum Home gives us a unique advantage in bringing a full product line directly to consumers. The direct to consumer initiative did increase our personal lines combined ratio in the quarter compared to last year and will continue to do so for a number of years.", "None the less, we are confident in our ability to succeed. And we believe this is an important step in our personal line strategy. We will however, always be and remain independent Asian based company and our commitment to delivering the best product possible at the most compelling value to our agents as paramount in our minds. Joe will of course, speak more of about personal line results and its initiative.", "Alan\u00a0Schnitzer will speak about our financial professional and international segment. But I would share with you that the claim activity we are experiencing in our financial and professional lines as of waits to financial related matters is consistent with what we were expecting and what we shared with you last quarter. Consequently and positively, there is no change in our out look in that regard", "In the investment arena, we continue to be pleased with our portfolio performance in this most difficult environment. Our long term fixed income portfolio produced with terms very much consistent with expectations that our alternative portfolio posted negative returns for the third consecutive quarter.", "We are pleased that we have had a low level of impairments relative to our $72 dollar investment portfolio and we remain 94% fixed income invested with an average rate in the double A plus.", "Well in the past, some might have thought our under lighting and investment philosophy to be conservative, we are pleased that the characterization seems now to have morph to prudent. As further evidence, Jay will be sharing with you an interesting analysis of our exposures related to a group of companies Moody's have identified as \u201cbottom rung\u201d. It\u2019s another example of thoughtful risk management in our organization.", "Finally, given all the recent press reports on merger activity, including some mentioning us. Let me reiterate our philosophy on transactions. First, we will not comment on any specific situation. In addition, given our substantial experience, we believe we understand the risk inherent in an acquisition quite well.", "Our financial objective is to deliver in mid-teens turn on equity over time to our shareholders. As a result, we would only gauge a new transactions, which given all the risk inherent in the M&A environment, we fundamentally believe makes that mission more achievable. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jay. Our investment portfolio, our reserves, our capital, and all liquidity remain in very good shape. As we have said over many quarters, operating company capital remain at or above all of our target levels. Our debts to total capital ratio actually decreases to 18.9%, which is below our 20% target, the midpoint of a 15% to 25% range that derives from our double A ratings.", "Holding company liquidity increased over $2.5 billion, which is approximately $1.5 billion higher than our target of one year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends. And this is after using existing funds to retire a $141 million of debt that matured in the quarter.", "We have negligible amounts of debts maturing through 2011 and still do not rely on the commercial paper markets. Book value per share of $45.12 inclusive of a net unrealized investment gain of $543 million after tax increased 5% during the quarter while book value per share ex-FAS 115 of $44.19 also increased by 2%. And we closed the quarter with approximately $26 billion of common equity.", "We updated the list on page 5 that shows areas of market disruptions and their impact or lack there of on Travelers. We have added valuations of preferred and hybrid security issued by global financial institutions so the list this quarter of which we current hold only $56 million after having taken impairments of $55 million in the current quarter. Overall, we continue to be unaffected in any significant way from these areas of market disruptions.", "We continue to look for and evaluate any information that could suggest investment valuation reps. Moody\u2019s has recently issued a publication entitled, Bottom Rang in which they provided 283 speculative grade non-financial US issuers with high default risk. We hold investments in only 14 of these names with an aggregate book value of only $26 million and a total market value of $23 million.", "Our bond business also reviewed its exposure to the entities on this list. Our commercial and construction surety business have aggregate expose limits to the identified as it is, net of reinsurance and collateral of approximately $270 million. If in a worst case and of course, unrealistic scenario, every account had a full limit loss or after tax exposure would be about $175 million. And as a result of discipline underwriting practices, we believe our actual exposure to loses on these accounts is actually negligible.", "Our high quality $72 billion investment portfolio, which remains well diversified across industries, investment types, and individual issuers, ended the first quarter with an $803 million free tax unrealized gain. Fixed income investments continued to comprise 94% of the total investment portfolio with a double A plus rating at a 4.2 duration. And the loan investment grade investment comprised only 2% of the fixed income portfolio.", "We continue to apply very rigorous processes to identify investments for which write down should be made. During the first quarter, we have recorded net realize investment loses of $137 million after tax, including impairments of $120 million after tax, comparable to the fourth quarter of 2008 and representing a very small percentage of both our investment portfolio and our capital.", "The information that appears on page seven is based on a schedule that it will appear in our form 10-Q showing unrealized losses on investments, which estimated fear value of less than 80% of amortized cost. This amount has decreased from the fourth quarter of 2008 and now stands at $673 million to enlarge parts of the impairment taken on the quarter. While still a small fraction of both total investments and share holders equity, we do closely monitor these investments for these are the most likely source of future impairments.", "I\u2019d also like to make one of the important observations that is reflective of the discipline and rigor of our investment impairment process. We have no investments for which fair value is less than 80% of cost for more than 12 months and those were in the of 6 to 12 month category adds up to less than a $100 million.", "Finally I would point to pages 23 through 26 of the webcast, the appendix in which we provide supplementary information about our commercial package securities and the composition of our private equity hedge fund and real estate portfolios.", "Shown on page eight are operating income of $799 million declined 21% from the prior quarter primarily due to a $176 million after tax reduction and net investment income, which I will discuss further in a minute. Margin compression that we had anticipated in our plan based upon recent pricing and lost cost trends and lower net favorable prior year reserved development, all partially offset by a $40 million reduction on our estimate of Texas Windstorm assessments related to Hurricane Ike, and $69 million in tax benefits resulting from the favorable resolution of various tax matters. Net losses were fairly comparable quarter-to-quarter.", "Net tax and net favorable prior year development, our GAAP combined ratio is 93.9%. And after adjustment for the change in the (inaudible) estimate, which was worth 1.two points, it was 95.1. So we remain pleased with the underlying profitability of our businesses.", "First quarter net investment income of $474 million after tax, or which is shown on page nine, was down significantly from the first quarter of 2008, but up slightly from the most recent quarter. The long term fixed income portfolio's after tax yield was 3.7%, consistent with prior periods. Although the short term portfolio yielded only 40 basis points due to the very low interest \u2013 interest rate environment for short term investments.", "The non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 11.1% as private equity real estate partnerships and hedge fund valuation continued to be challenged by financial market conditions. And consistent with our practice, we updated as best we could our non-fixed income returns through March 31 despite the usual time lag in which investment managers report results.", "Page ten of the webcast shows the three major contributors to our operating return on equity fixed income NII plus interest on corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.two points in the current quarter, down slightly from prior years due to the lower short term interest rates. Non-fixed income NII, our much smaller contributor to operating ROE, or one that varies from period to period, contributed a negative 1.7 points in the current quarter. And underwriting income contributed 5.9 points.", "Cumulatively from January 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.4%, consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE.", "And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Turning to slide 11, the business insurance operating earnings of $547 million was down 20% from last year, primarily due to the drop in investment income. The underwriting results had a lot of moving pieces, but in the aggregate, a pretty good story.", "Net favorable prior year reserve development, although lower than last year, was still considerable at $118 million after tax, and Cap losses were light. Net of these items, our combined ratio improved half a point. We reduced the estimate of our Texas Windpool assessment from Hurricane Ike, lowering our expense ratio nearly one point, and large losses, which were running heavy in first quarter 2008, returned to planned level. Absent all these impacts, the rate and loss trends in business insurance resulted in about two points of margin compression, which was consistent with our expectations.", "I'll talk about the rate trends as I go through the top line. On the left side, frequency trends are relatively flat and loss inflation remains benign in the low single-digits. We are watching for the impact of a more challenging economic environment on our loss activity, and to date, there hasn\u2019t been anything of significance. So we feel good about the bottom line story, but just as good about the top line.", "Turning to production, net written premium increased 2% in the first quarter of 2008. As we have reported last quarter, the economic slowdown has negatively impacted those businesses in the construction, constructing fields, as well as large property accounts. However, in spite of the broad economic contraction, many of our businesses are indeed experiencing premium growth. We are pleased with the overall production results, which underscore our ability to find opportunities in difficult conditions.", "As shown on slide 12, retention remains high across all our domestic commercial businesses, uniformly exceeding first quarter of last year, and at or higher than the fourth quarter. In the face of significant instability in the marketplace, these results reflect customers\u2019 flight quality and are an important component of our continuing success.", "The renewal price change data indicates that prices on these renewed accounts are relatively stable. And in general, show an improving trend. Slide 13 takes the price change data and splits it into its two primary components, the renewal rate, and exposure change. The trend shows rate change has been moving up. And then in the aggregate, it\u2019s now approaching zero. At the same time, exposure change has been dropping. And in most of our businesses, has turned negative. This of course, is a reflection of the contracting economy.", "On slide 14, we display our new business results, and this is an area where our story has began to shift very positively over the recent quarter. In the aggregate, new business dollars are up 1% from the first quarter of 2008. This is the first quarter-over-quarter increase in new business in over two years. And a significant improvement from the down 7% to 8% we were experiencing early last year. The improvement is being driven by two factors.", "First, and clear from the numbers on this slide, our new products and platform roll out in select is having a strong impact. With new business, dollar\u2019s up 20% from first quarter of \u201808. The second is less obvious from this slide. And that is that throughout the quarter, we have seen an improvement in the quality of deal submissions in our middle market businesses. For over a year now, we have had consistent new business methods in business insurance. That is, very strong submission for the flow of new business opportunity, barely constant quote ratios, and slightly declining hit ratios.", "We were comfortable that although this resulted in less quarter-over-quarter new business dollars, we were getting more opportunities in maintaining our underwriting standards in tough market conditions. So what\u2019s changed? For across a broad array of our new market businesses, these trends have improved with not only greater submission flow, but more importantly, improvement in the quality of that flow. We are now seeing more of our competitors\u2019 premier accounts, those $250,000 to $1 million accounts that are stable, well-managed businesses for a conscious diverged management and value quality partners.", "Slide 15 shows the amount of new business we are writing in commercial accounts and other business insurance as a percentage of our expiring banks for the last five quarters, as well as month by month in the current quarter. The reason we show the new businesses as a percentage of the expiring date take the impact of seasonality out of the numbers. You can see that in both February and March, we sought significant increase in our new business writings. We usually don\u2019t focus too much on monthly data. But here, we think the trends in the last two months speak into a real new business opportunity for us and is worth some emphasis and explanation.", "First, I want to emphasize that we feel very good about the profitability of the business. We have lots of metrics around pricing. And our increased writings are hitting target return levels for new business. Second, the increase is not accidental. It is a result of the very conscious strategy to expand product offerings, better rewind our capability, and more proactively seek opportunities in the market. We\u2019ve been talking to you about this for several years, and we believe market conditions are now such that we can see some real benefit.", "Third, the flight quality is very much agent broker driven. Although somewhat anecdotal, it is clear to us that agents are focused on ensuring that their customers, especially their best quality accounts, are very high-quality markets like Travelers. And this dynamic has been much more noticeable in the recent months. Fourth, the improvement in the rate environment has been an obvious enabler to these results.", "And lastly, our success is being driven by our confidence in our people on the point of sales. Unlike many of our competitors, we are not on our heels. We are well positioned and looking for ways to invest and drive opportunities. Our frontline staff is fully focused on the marketplace and is energized by our collective success.", "So we\u2019re not going to predict where the market will go, but we are encouraged by the quarter\u2019s results. Although exposures are contracting, the rate trends are improving and the flight to quality is impacting both the amount and quality of our opportunities. The result is that the business insurance segment produced an improved top line and continued solid market. Given the broad economic contractions, we are very pleased with these results.", "With that, let me turn you over to Alan Schnitzer for the financial, professional & international results.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thanks, Brian. Turning to slide 16, in the financial, professional & international insurance segment, operating income was $148 million for the quarter as compared to $208 million in the prior year. The adjusted combined ratio for the quarter was 91.6%, up 2.8 points from the first quarter of last year. This was primarily driven by a small number of large losses in our international business. These losses were consistent with our expectations, but higher than they were in the first quarter of 2008.", "To a lesser extent, a mixed change as a result of lower construction surety bonds also impacted the combined ratio. Adjusting to the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, net written premiums declined 6%. In bond and financial products, the decreased net written premium is primarily due to lower volumes in the surety business. In the international business, the decrease resulted from changes in foreign exchange rate as well as the timing of reinsurance treaties in 2009 versus 2008.", "Turning to slide 17, in our management liability business in the quarter, retention remains high and consistent with the past four quarters. Renewal price change was positive at 2%, reflecting positive rate, partially offset by decrease in exposure. New business was a little lower than in the prior year, driven by declines in new business in both financial institutions and private non-profit, largely due to disciplined underwriting. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in our public company liability business, primarily due to flight to quality.", "In the international business, retention was at 78% in the quarter, in line with recent quarters and down 4 points year-over-year, primarily due to intentional underwriting actions. Renewal price change was flat as slightly positive rate was offset by decreased exposure. Adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates, new business was ahead of the prior year.", "In our fourth quarter earnings call, we updated you on the impact of the financial market disruption on our management liability business. As we told you, we continue to monitor that analysis on a monthly basis, and our conclusions remain the same. Due to a well diversified portfolio, and disciplined management of the exposures, we expect that the management liability business will continue to be profitable in 2009.", "With that, let me turn it over to Joe for discussion on personal insurance.", "Joe Lacher", "Thanks, Allan. Personal insurance had a good quarter, solid earning and top line growth. Despite some adverse weather and the challenging auto marketplace, the business continues to demonstrate sound results. Something I\u2019m especially pleased with given these difficult economic times. Our personal insurance business continues to benefit from a balanced mix of auto and property business.", "When you turn to page 18, you can see the first quarter has strong combined ratio of 93% and a 3% growth in net written premiums. And for the first quarter of 2008, operating income is down $27 million driven primarily by lower levels of net investment income, and increase in weather-related losses, and reduced underwriting margins related to pricing, lost cost trends and mix changes, partially offset by net payable prior year development, and our previously discussed reduction in the two-year assessments.", "Before getting into product specific results, I\u2019d like to share some details on our exciting direct to consumer initiative. As Jay mentioned earlier, during the quarter, we announced our intention to expand, strengthen and broadly deploy our capabilities to market directly to consumers. Travelers is a leading independent agency company and is committed to enhancing our leadership position with agents. While we believe that the independent agency channel is and will remain vibrant, we also recognize that a growing population of consumers is choosing to purchase auto insurance directly. With our execution strength and by being respectful to valued independent agents deliver, we\u2019re confident we can successfully distribute through both channels simultaneously.", "Successful introduction of our quantum product and the investment in our claim infrastructure has enabled us to competitively serve a broad cross-section of consumers. We have experience in distributing products outside of the independent agency channels to our robust affinity business. We have been expanding our existing capabilities and increasing our activities to market insurance directly to consumers. We\u2019ve already successfully expanded our web capabilities in advertising. And in the second quarter, we will expand our marketing with a multimedia campaign, including television advertising.", "We recognize that results to the direct-to-consumer initiative will have an impact on our combined ratio for a number of years. For the full year 2009, we\u2019d expected to have a combined ratio impact of 2.5 points for auto, and one point for homeowner and other. We believe this initiative will better position us to profitably grow our business and is well worth the investment. We\u2019re excited about both our prospects and our early progress. Looking specifically at our auto results, our combined ratio for the quarter was 102% or 3 points higher than the first quarter of 2008.", "As you can see on page 19, this increase was driven by two points from the results of our direct-to-consumer initiative, and by an additional two points from net unfavorable prior year car (inaudible) reserve development related to New Jersey PIPP and modeling industries. The New Jersey results were driven by a difficult PIPP environment, exacerbated by the fact that we had a number of operational missteps in recognizing and responding to the local environment\u2019s emerging trends.", "We believe that we\u2019ve identified those underlying issues, reset our organization, and are executing the steps necessary to fix these issues. Excluding the impact of our direct-to-consumer initiative, our full year 2009 guidance assumes an auto combined ratio in the high 90\u2019s. As I mentioned earlier, the direct to consumer initiatives expect to impact the auto combined ratio by 2.5 points for the full year. For those of you who wonder how we foresee a 98 combined ratio, it would mean our return threshold, albeit at the low end of the range.", "Looking at our auto production results on page 20, retention was 82%, (inaudible) grew 1% over the first quarter of 2008, and renewal price change increased to 5% reflecting proactive rate filing activity. We are seeing a decrease in new business volumes and looking at policies in four state in our statistical supplements, you can see the sequential quarter policies and force decline.", "We believe that in these challenging economic times, more consumers are demonstrating increased sensitivity to auto premiums. Similar to previous quarters, we experienced auto loss trends declining slightly, severity trend was slightly increasing, was offset by moderately decreased frequency.", "Turning to property results, we produced an excellent combined ratio of 83%, which is two points lower than first quarter of 2008. Production results for the quarter were strong, but policies enforce growth consistent 3%, retention stable at 86% and renewal price change plus 6%. We remain pleased that continuing growth of the Quantum Home products, and its ability to drive profitable new business despite very challenging economic conditions.", "Quantum Home policies now represent more than 13% of our policies enforced. Our property business remains the great strength of our personal insurance franchise and one that we will continue to leverage. While the marketplace remains competitive, we are seeing increasing times at priming in the auto line. We are continuing to monitor lost trends, profitability, and marketplace conditions as well as the changing economic environment as we adjust our tactics going forward. We remain pleased with our overall results and look forward to building on that success.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Joe. Page 21 sets forth our annual guidance for 2009 along with certain supporting information. We continue to project fully diluted operating income per share in the range of $4.50 to $4.90, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 10% to 11%. Based upon the limited visibility we have of the investment environment today, we will guide you through the lower half of this range.", "Our guidance assumes full year cat losses of $360 million after tax, or $0.62 per diluted share. No additional prior year reserve development either favorable or unfavorable. No significant changes in private equity in hedge fund valuations for the remainder of the year as we are assuming unchanged capital market conditions. Lower real estate partnership valuations due to a continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values, share repurchase of $750 million, taking into account potential investment opportunities, for which returns more properly reflect risk and the uncertain economic conditions at all businesses space, rather than a shift in our capital management strategy. Also, no significant change in average invested assets EX-FAS 115 and a weighted average diluted share cap of approximately 585 million shares.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Thanks, Jay. Just a quick closing comment before I turn it back to Gabby to take the questions. We are obviously a very fact-based organization, and we tend to report on statistics very heavily. But I\u2019d like to make an observation that's somewhat anecdotal and really reflects much of what Brian and Joe and Alan have been speaking about for the last half hour. There is a sense of enthusiasm and confidence, and a real upbeat feel in our field organization that is really quite remarkable. It is palpable. And the combination of the dynamics in the industry and in our business, meeting up with that sense of confidence in the field, just gives us a real upbeat sense of where this organization can head over the near term. Can\u2019t give you a specific, there\u2019s no emotion meter that we can measure. But when you sit with any of our field folks, you'll see it, and you'll feel it, and understand it.", "With that, Gabby, let's take some questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Gabby Nawi", "Right. Just so you all now, there are no conflicting calls today so we\u2019re prepared to stay on and answer whatever questions you have. And with, Lisa, you can open up the questions, although I ask that you limit it to two, if possible. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Matthew Heimermann with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hi. Good morning, everybody. First, I\u2019ll try to make it good. With the direct strategy, can you talk a little bit about \u2013 and I think you\u2019ve mentioned this in your comments. But how much of the direct market you feel like your product will address on day one? And also whether or not, I know you talked about platform in Quantum and all these other \u2013 in claims that play a role and you being ready to roll out. But is there also now a significant shift in preferred customer shopping directly as well?", "Joe Lacher", "Two good questions, Matt. I\u2019ll try to hit them separately. Our quantum product has the capacity to address a very broad cross-section of the marketplace. We don\u2019t target the real need of the standard marketplace. But it does have the ability to hit the broad cross-section. What you\u2019ll see more early though is more a function of brand as we use the Travelers brand and we think about its positioning, we will send our targeting market there. So there\u2019s a need of that brand's appeal, which will be a little bit more towards a preferred end. And it will have a little bit of a recognition of folks who are buying the value proposition that is isn't cheap. It's buying quality.", "So that target will not hit the full range of what folks think about in the direct marketplace and will expand from there. It\u2019s a plausible way to enter the marketplace, expand our capabilities, build out our experience, and do a leveraging of our position of strength. It will also leverage our homeowners\u2019 capacity, which we really do believe is a unique competitive advantage that we have. And we\u2019ll recognize consumers who are trying to think about the full breadth of their risk. (inaudible) I'm sorry.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I\u2019m sorry, go ahead.", "Joe Lacher", "Regarding your second question on shopping behavior, we\u2019re seeing increases in shopping behavior. I wouldn\u2019t describe the preferred or highly preferred market moving to level that we typically see in our standard market. I do think you\u2019re seeing increases, albeit from \u2013 in those actually are from a lower starting point. But there is a general economic environment for people who are a little more sensitive to their expenditures and they\u2019re probing and asking questions. They're thinking about exposures. They\u2019re thinking about how to impact net premium and they're more sensitive to rate increases. We haven\u2019t seen \u2013 it's not like we\u2019ve see in a huge percentage of our book calling and checking things, but we have seen increases in call activities and inquiries.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "That's helpful. With respect to the homeowners\u2019 product, is it \u2013 obviously, well I would guess there would be a package discount for people buying book. But should we think about homeowners as being a driver of the auto or the auto pulling the homeowners? That makes sense?", "Joe Lacher", "I think it does. And let me \u2013 you tell me when I answer if I got your point. In all likelihood, in our marketing, we would be auto and we will closely bring in any sales process system and the marketing ability to cover all of your needs, and exactly have those products integrate and work together. We do offer discounts when you buy those in auto and a home, and a discount to the auto, and a discount to the home. We offer that today. So that\u2019s running trough our pricing returning to our results. We will highlight those items, and we will likely draw out the things that help them interact together a little bit more. I think we\u2019ll lead with the auto. I think the benefit of having them together will cause both of them to improve both of their production results.", "Jay Fishman", "And Matt, I would just add from experience, watching Joe and his management team develop Quantum Auto and Quantum Home, this is really an exceptional group of test and learn. All of the things that we\u2019ve done in this venture have been slow, methodical test and learn. And one of the things that we\u2019re going to do as we move forward here is try any number of different marketing concepts and see which pulls harder. And we don\u2019t necessarily know the answer. And frankly, we\u2019re going to be doing some things that other people either can\u2019t or don\u2019t do because they don\u2019t have the product. But in these early days, Joe is exactly right. We are going to lead with the Auto product. But don\u2019t be surprised if you\u2019re watching a commercial in a state and see a pull for Hme because we\u2019re going to be testing to see how it does.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "All right. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker with Citi. Please proceed.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Citi", "Good morning, everyone. During the opening remarks where you said that you weren\u2019t going to talk about acquisitions. I won\u2019t even go there. You mentioned that the whole point was to get a mid-teens ROE. And we\u2019re not there right now. I realized there\u2019s some hope of the things are improving the marketplace. But if rates stay where they are right now when you don\u2019t get interest rate improvement, what is the forecast for ROE for the next couple of years? And how do we get that up?", "Jay Benet", "Our financial goal is actually a mid-teens return on equity over time. And those last two words are really extremely important, not only because of the cyclicality that our industry has experienced historically. Although there\u2019s been less cyclicality over the last several years. We\u2019ve talked about that a lot. And perhaps those who have been involved in the industry for a long term recall. But obviously also because of the weather dynamic. We priced product to produce returns over a long period of time. Sometimes the wind blows, sometimes it doesn\u2019t.", "Observations up from the \u2013 for the four-year period 2005 through 2008 is that we actually have a 14.5% after tax operating return on equity over that four-year period. So we\u2019re in a cycle, we\u2019re a combination of reasons. Obviously, the investment arena is more challenging at the moment. We are obviously focused on pricing, and we\u2019re going to see how the extent to which we can maintain that strategy. But we want the business for the long term. We priced our product for the long term. We make long term investment decisions. So we\u2019re not going to react in any particularly harsh way to drive returns up. We believe that the industry has the dynamics that enable the best companies to produce those mid-teens return on equity over time. And we think we\u2019re one of them. And we\u2019re on track to continue to do that.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Citi", "Okay. Well let me try and attack from one other way, and then I'll give up. I think that the media might just have been looking for a quote, and they wound up picking on you in order to make their point. But the Travelers will be happy to participate in the PIPP \u2013 or PPIP as a buyer of securities and not as a seller. Maybe you\u2019re just being open-minded about that. But do you have thoughts about getting investment returns up over the next year? Is there less risk out there? Will you be at all opportunistic in this marketplace?", "Jay Benet", "First, in respect of the comment about the government program, we recalled about 32nd after the announcement of the program and before there were any materials about what it meant to be in the program and what the opportunities were or wouldn\u2019t be. And our response to that was perhaps not as elegant as it might have been, but we\u2019ll consider anything. We\u2019ll certainly consider looking at any program to the extent that there is an opportunity to produce \u2013 to produce returns. As it turns out, it doesn\u2019t look to us like it makes sense for us to participate in that program.", "The comment about being as a seller was that we had no need to. Our investment portfolio was such was that there was no need to participate in it as a seller. For the moment, our investment profile remains as it has been. There isn\u2019t anything that we\u2019re doing with our cash flow today that\u2019s different from what we were doing six months or a year ago. We run the business for the long term. Yield in returns are perhaps returning to normalize long term levels. But I\u2019ll ask Bill. There isn\u2019t anything that we\u2019re doing different (inaudible).", "Bill McLean", "Hi. We have always attempted to benchmark risks as opposed to returns. We\u2019d like to maintain a relatively constant level of risk in the portfolio and to get whatever the best return that is possible with that level of risk. And right now that return, of last year or so, has been lower than we liked. We think it might start to get a little higher. But we\u2019re using cash in much the same manner as we have. We\u2019re staying pretty high up the credit scale.", "I think everybody can agree there has been the equivalent of 100-year flood. But the debate is whether the water is still receding or gently rising. We think it\u2019s still gently rising. We think that there\u2019s a lot of (inaudible) in the system that will have to be liquidated, equitized. And the consequences to get holders in that process maybe pretty severe and would determine if that is true of our securities as possible be subject to it. So we\u2019re concentrating on corporates and municipals with an average quality of AA or better.", "Jay Benet", "We don\u2019t change to \u2013 attempt to answer your question more specifically, we don\u2019t chase return. Page five of this webcast is what it is because we've had a long standing discipline of not chasing return. We don\u2019t chase it on the underwriting side, and we don\u2019t chase it on the investment side. One of the reasons that we actually stopped buying residential mortgage backed securities at the end of 2004 was that the difference between a Fannie Mae ten-year security obviously rated in AAA. And a then AAA residential mortgage backed security structure, without the implicit guarantee of the US government, the difference was 25 basis points. Well, anyone can say, \u201cGee, AAA is AAA, and those 25 basis points might be worth it.\u201d We tend not to reach for yields. So you\u2019re not going to see a dramatic shift in what we do, either on the insurance side or in the investment side.", "Josh Shanker \u2013 Citi", "Thank you for all the response. And good luck to you.", "Jay Benet", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "My question has to do with the pace of pricing improvement in commercial lines. We\u2019ve heard some carriers be more robust in their view of what\u2019s going on currently in the rate environment and Travelers, and some brokers seem to be less optimistic. I\u2019m trying to get a sense of why you think there\u2019s so much disagreement about what\u2019s going on currently in the pace of the rate of change on pricing.", "Jay Fishman", "Jay, I don\u2019t \u2013This is Jay Fishman, and I'll let Brian step in. I don\u2019t actually think that there is much disagreement amongst different companies. The data is what it is. And we present the data with one of the two companies that actually present the data very clearly, as you can see it and understand it. I read everyone else\u2019s reports, I don\u2019t hear any inconsistencies. Where there is an inconsistency is there are some companies that are very comfortable declaring that we\u2019re at a turn.", "And they\u2019ve been very bullish and very optimistic about the near term. The circumstances that we are in specifically, lend us \u2013bring us to the conclusion that that\u2019s not the most prudent thing to do. Economic environment\u2019s still very difficult, exposures declining, cost pressures on every business. If anyone thinks that they\u2019ve been in this specific circumstance before, they don\u2019t understand the complexity of it. So what you\u2019re hearing from us is we\u2019re straight on declaring a turn. We\u2019re going to report the data to you. And I\u2019m going to ask Brian to comment again on the rate gains. But the only thing you\u2019re hearing from us in the context of robustness is a willingness to make predictions without the benefit of a crystal ball.", "Brian McLean", "Yes. And I think, Jay, we\u2019ve talked about it in the past and so with a lot of other people. There\u2019s a difference between statements that are made by companies based on real data. And there\u2019s a difference from anecdotal surveys. I would argue that the anecdotal surveys are always, by their nature, going to be heavily driven to new business or business that's actively in the marketplace, and that\u2019s not true of each and every account.", "Looking at the stuff we presented, I think that we feel very good about the momentum, especially in core middle market and broadly \u2013 very broadly speaking, the commercial \u2013 the net commercial businesses. And we\u2019ve turn from a couple 3 to 4 points to negative on pure rate to something that\u2019s pretty close to zero. The small commercial always moves a little slower on up and down. So, it\u2019s moving a little slower up than some of those other markets, but we feel great about the margins in that business. And are pretty happy where we are in the direction we\u2019re going.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And, Jay, that maybe \u2013 the underlying mix, maybe some of the discord that you hear, which is if you\u2019re speaking to someone who\u2019s representing a small agency business they\u2019re going to be more strained as we look at our select numbers. And they didn\u2019t go down nearly as much and it has yet to come up very much. And towards the middle market end, you see that if it declined, and now it\u2019s moving up pretty \u2013", "Brian MacLean", "And another dynamic that\u2019s important here is all of these data is obviously the average of thousands of different accounts, which are all over the place. So one perspective, a year ago in our middle market business, broadly speaking, about one out of every four accounts we\u2019re getting a price increase. And in today\u2019s environment, about half of our accounts are getting a price increase. And obviously, the remainders go in the other direction. But it's a blending, we look at every account, especially in the individual and direct account stuff. We look at every account individually. And so, broad-versed comments are hard to come by.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "My follow up \u2013 and thanks very much for that answer. My follow up has to do with the trends in pricing for new business. Can you talk about that, especially in the core market? Is it more aggressive for new business and renewal business on pricing?", "Jay Benet", "No more so than normal. It is always more aggressive pricing for new business and renewal business. We did talk clearly about our business in the data we have. We agonized over looking at what we believe the returns are on new business that we're writing. We compare it to renewal accounts. We try to adjust for mix and market, and everything you can imagine. We continue to feel pretty good that the business that we're seeing and the business we're writing is still hitting the returns that we would have for writing new accounts.", "One of the comments I tried to get across is I feel that we, and I suspect not everybody, is seeing an improvement in the quality of the stuff that's out there in the market. And that's made us feel even better about our pricing. But new business is always competitive at one end of the spectrum, and it's been at one end of it for a while. But we feel good about what we're writing.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neil Partners. Please proceed.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners", "Good morning, and thank you for the call. Maybe a little history would be helpful for at least me. Once upon a time, Travelers actually tried to get a direct model going. And clearly, the existence of Quantum is a big difference between then and now. But maybe you could chat about how the process has really changed and why? I think at one point in time there was some pretty convincing arguments that it was not worth the while, where you obviously changed your mind. And can you just maybe compare and contrast the two periods?", "Jay Benet", "Sure. And I assume what you're talking about is some of the work we've done back in the mid to late 90s with our PFS cross-sell and the secure program that's under cross-sell with our Citibank credit card business?", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "And what we had there \u2013 and I would just add to Joe's point, is that at that point, the company was a subsidiary of Citi Group that is Travelers. And the program that Joe was about to describe was a very structured program designed to take the Travelers' product and make it available to PFS agents. Quite different, just to contrast \u2013 quite different than what we are about to undertake now. But recognize, we were part of Citi Group at that point.", "Jay Benet", "Yes. Those were programmed again, as Jay described, very specifically not going to a broad consumer population, but leveraging existing populations and existing relationships and shoehorning that distribution platform into our product.", "And at that time, the complexity of dealing with that shoehorning process and the less effective products that we had relative to Quantum today, those combined to perform \u2013 to produce results that were not great results. We had very much had a product that was tuned towards preferred \u2013 highly preferred costumers distributed through independent agents, and didn\u2019t have the operational infrastructure to deal with the differences that came from this different distribution platform. What we have today is really different on almost every front.", "The product is meaningfully more sophisticated. We\u2019ve got the folks in-house that know how to deal with that and manage that product, and at the management information to handle it. We\u2019ve rebuilt our claim organization and their ability to manage higher frequency cases with greater efficiency and to manage the severity on those programs. And so, we had the capacity to deliver that. And we\u2019ve rebuilt a good chunk of our systems infrastructure to be able to deal with the other operational impact around us. So it\u2019s almost a different company than it was ten years ago when we tried some of those efforts. So there\u2019s not a lot \u2013 the same other than the fact that we\u2019re still selling auto insurance.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes. I\u2019ll make two observations. One is that, it really wasn\u2019t a direct sale, it was sale through a captive agent. PFS had a group of captive agents and they were selling the products. So it was not really direct to consumer, this is \u2013 that's quite different. Two, that effort, the captive agent program, was not successful. And one of the terrific things about lack of success is what you learn from it. And so the learnings from that experience are substantial, and in fact formed the basis for much of the operational and tactical thinking that Joe and his group had done and positioned this one to be successful. A good question, but a very, very different program.", "Jay Benet", "A lot of what we\u2019ve done in the last six or seven years has been tuning those items. And what we really have, as the opportunity here, is we have not spent a lot of time in marketing direct to consumers. And that\u2019s the learning you\u2019re going to see us working on right now. And the core build-out that we have left of the initiative is how to be more effective marketers with the program.", "Brian McLean", "And that's, I guess as Jay has mentioned before, way to see our test and learn.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners", "Good. Are you going to have different prices in product tweaks for direct versus agency?", "Jay Benet", "No. Right now we\u2019ve got one product, one pricing platform. And we\u2019re going to leverage that and use that in both environments.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neil Partners", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney. Please proceed.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Thank you, and good morning. Can you quantify what the non-Cat weather was in the quarter?", "Jay Benet", "The bulk of it was personal line related. And it was just an increase in the general weather activity, things that didn\u2019t classify as Cat, by our definition of Cat, whether it was with storm activity, basic thunderstorm activity, hail, tornadoes. I\u2019m looking for the number as we\u2019re \u2013 as I\u2019m answering it.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Keep talking.", "Jay Benet", "Just let me \u2013 give us a minute to find the exact number, Larry.", "Jay Benet", "On the business insurance side, it was a modest positive. The negative bearings was on the personal side.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Great. And then just numbers or accounting question, the Texas Windstorm, that\u2019s accounted for in the expense ratio as opposed to the loss ratio? And then secondly, on the discussion on the direct consumer, the press release described the impact as the results, not the investment in it. So going forward, when we see what the impact is, is that going to include those underwriting results and the investment in the new program?", "Jay Benet", "We try to hit all of those and assuming reverse orders. It is describing the results, which includes the underwriting and the expense, and everything around it. It's a total view there. And that's what we intend to talk about to get a more wholesome disclosure.", "Jay Fishman", "And through that point, in the early period, Larry, of the program, we will have underwriting losses like we in the (inaudible) experienced in the direct channel is that you test and learn. And that test and learn experience will (inaudible) itself. We believe those underwriting losses in the direct channel. And so we intend to continue to give disclosure and clarity throughout its entirety.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. Just on that point, do you have an expected breakeven period?", "Jay Benet", "You know the complexity underneath this. There's breakeven on an economic basis, and there is breakeven on a reported basis. You will be \u2013 it'll be several years before we get to that number, and we're not \u2013 (inaudible) disclosing that projection. It will hit economic breakeven, obviously, before it hips a GAAP reporting breakeven.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Okay. That's fair. Thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "This is Jay, Larry. Just in terms of a small weather impact, for round numbers on an after tax basis, it looks like it's about $20 million if you look at it on period-over-period basis. So that would be the delta.", "And relative to your accounting question with regard to assessments, you are right. The accounting that we do is to take assessments like (inaudible), and put them through the expense line because there will be recoveries in the future associated with taxes, licenses, and fee accounting. So that's where it all is.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Langen McAlenney", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And our next question will come from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thanks a lot. A couple of quick questions, one, would it be possible to break down the change in unrealized just by a couple of the large categories, maybe your non-agency mortgage backs, the corporate debts, and maybe offsets in some of the other asset categories. And I just have one follow up. Thank you.", "Jay Fishman", "In terms of \u2013 we could \u2013", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "In broad strokes. I just want to understand where \u2013 I mean where did a lot of the mark come, in one group or in another; just to understand how the quarters stack up?", "Jay Fishman", "The primary change in unrealized came about because of the Munich portfolio. If you looked at the marks on the Munich portfolio as of the end of the year, they were different than where they were now. I think that would be the primary driver of the change.", "Jay Benet", "And the VAT, it was largely an improvement in the ratio of yield, the Treasury yield. Because as you remember, the ten-year backed up from $2.21 to $2.66 in the first quarter.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "All right. Great. And then, as far as the Select business and on the business side, was there any segment that benefited from improved penetration there over any other, any of the main line GL, comp, or any of those other recording segments?", "Jay Benet", "Yes. In Select, we've seen \u2013 all of our lines of business experienced productivity, increase in sales and growth. Our comp business, particularly relative to, say, a year ago or three years ago, has seen probably the most significant amount of growth.", "Jay Fishman", "And they are as a result of a very intentional strategy.", "Jay Benet", "It's a very intentional strategy to bring our Travelers Express operational model and pricing model and capabilities there. We feel very good about the underlying margins, and track them in a whole variety of different ways very specifically. So we feel good about that underlying growth.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Right. And is the profile \u2013 the new \u2013 that new comp business or is it any different than the profile of the existing book of business that you have? Or just more penetration into the same margin?", "Jay Benet", "Particularly on the Travelers Express side, it is consistent or better than the profile book of business that we have.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation for today.

", "As a reminder, this call is being recorded today, October 22, 2009.  At this time I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Gabriella Nawi ", "Thank you. Good morning gentlemen and ladies and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our third quarter 2009 results.  Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning.  All of these materials can be found on our website at www.Travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO, Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer, and Brian W.

They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment.  They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay I\u2019d like to draw your attention on Page 1 of the webcast.  Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  All statements, other than statements of historical facts, may be forward-looking statements.  Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about upcoming results of operation, financial [inaudible] and liquidity, sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves, and other [inaudible].

Actual results may be [inaudible] current expectations due to a variety of factors.  These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC.  We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.  Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention Travelers operating income which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that may be non-GAAP financial measures.  Reconciliations are available on our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website.  ", "Thank you, and let me pass it to Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi.  Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today.  We\u2019re pleased to be with you this morning reporting another strong quarter.  In addition to posting operating income of $914 million and an operating return on equity in excess of 14%, based upon our confidence in our underlying operations, we\u2019ve increased our regular quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.33 a share.  We repurchased $1 billion of our own stock in the third quarter. ", "We raised our estimate for fourth quarter repurchases to $1.5 billion and our Board authorized an additional $6 billion for our share repurchase program. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute our strategy of generating solid current returns and returning excess capital to shareholders. ", "Since the middle of 2006 when we commenced our share buyback program, we\u2019ve repurchased nearly $8 billion of our own shares at an overall average cost of $48.67.  The $8 billion represents approximately 27% of the market capitalization of the company when we commenced the program.  As we\u2019ve indicated before, this is not tactical, but rather strategic.  We continue to leverage our competitive advantages to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate top tier earnings, and return excess capital to our shareholders.  ", "A lot of good things happened this quarter, evidenced by strong underwriting results as well as much improved investment performance.  On the underwriting side, results continue to be quite solid and benefited from net favorable reserve development in excess of $200 million after tax, even after completing our annual asbestos review.  In our ongoing businesses, loss costs remain quite benign and the third quarter also benefited from a re-estimation of 2009 loss estimates to lower levels.", "On the investment front, our long term fixed income portfolio continued to produce consistent returns.  On the short term front, investment yields remain quite negligible and this continues to impact investment income in our short term investment pool which at the end of the quarter stood at $6.6 billion.  The pool right now may be somewhat larger than it needs to be and we will look at that carefully but in any event, there\u2019s not much we can do about the low yields.  We do view it as an income opportunity when short rates increased to more normal historical levels.", "In the alternative investments arena, hedge funds and private equity returned to levels more consistent with long term historical performance although our real estate investment income continued to be challenged by the current environment. Given all that\u2019s gone on over the past two years, we\u2019re quite pleased with our results.  ", "From a revenue perspective, net written premiums declined 3% from the prior year quarter, primarily due to reduced exposures from existing customers, largely attributable to declining economic activity in recent quarters.  A simple example of this is workers compensation, in that as unemployment rises and payrolls decline, premiums drop accordingly.  Overall we have been successful in offsetting the impact on net written premiums on some of our exposure decline with renewal rate gains, solid retention, and new business.", "In that regard, renewal rate gains were positive in each of our business segments and our strategy remains to seek rate where needed so that the pricing of our product reflects our long term return expectations.  Institutionally, however, as we have said all along, we remain cautious about the magnitude of future rate gains that are achievable given general economic conditions.  Nonetheless, solid retention and new business levels continue to demonstrate our strong position in the market and we\u2019re going to continue to deal with this market one quarter at a time.", "In response to a question last quarter, we had indicated that if rate gains remained on pace and loss trends remained generally the same, we believed we would be able to reach a point in business insurance by the end of this year where premiums on a written basis could be in an improving margin position.", "In fact, the rate gains we did achieve in business insurance were down a little from the previous pace as you can see by the small change in the slope of the line on Page 8 of the webcast.  As a consequence, we are not likely to achieve the margin crossover point by the end of this year.", "It\u2019s been some time since we\u2019ve spoken about cost efficiency but with a specific example we want to demonstrate that we\u2019ve not forgotten this important element of managing a business.  We shared with you before the remarkable success we\u2019re having with Travelers Express, our new small commercial business platform.  The platform is doing what we hoped it would do. Submissions are up, quotes are up, and new business is up year-over-year.  ", "An important element of the program is the increased automation that it has brought to independent agents\u2019 desks, resulting in much faster turnaround times and much less human intervention.  As a result of the success of the platform, we are now consolidating our small commercial underwriting centers from 36 to 12, allowing us to reduce the number of underwriters we need to staff those centers.  ", "At the same time, we are increasing our select sales organization by nearly 50 individuals to make sure that our technology platform is front and center in our agents\u2019 offices.  This will result in lower costs positioned against increased revenue and greater efficiency. We estimate that these changes will result in annual savings in excess of $9 million per year.  While this is not on its own a blockbuster cost action, you should know that this is representative of the way we think about things day in and day out.", "In closing, we feel very good about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in this extended period of financial turmoil and marketplace disruption and we believe that our results over this period of time have been quite impressive.  Furthermore, the results are a function of our culture, which consist of the best evaluators of risk and return in both our underwriting and investment operations that we possibly can be, no matter what the market conditions are.", "So far, so good.  With that, let me turn it over to Jay.  ", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jay.  Turning to Page 4, while capital leverage and liquidity measures were once again at or better than target, withholding company liquidity at $2.6 billion were more than twice its target, this after $1 billion of share repurchases and $166 million of common dividends in the quarter.  Our book value per share of $51.24 increased 18% year-to-date with a little more than half of this increase coming from a very sizable change in net unrealized gains and losses which ended the quarter in a pretax gain position of $3.4 billion.", "These net unrealized investment gains are the primary reason that our investment portfolio increased over $76 billion as of September 30.  We also reported after tax net realized investment gains of $21 million in the quarter, including impairment of only $12 million after tax. The dollar amount of investments for which fair value was continuously less than 80% of amortized cost which was only $374 million at the end of the most recent quarter is now down to only $187 million at the end of the current quarter.", "Since many investors and analysts are closely monitoring valuations of commercial real estate related investments, we\u2019ve provided an update to our previous disclosures in the appendix to this webcast.  Overall our investment portfolio continues to be very high quality and well diversified across industries, investment types, and individual issuers.", "I\u2019d also like to point out that while not a third quarter transaction, we did sell half of our Verisk holdings, formerly known as [Isell] in connection with their fourth quarter IPO, receiving gross proceeds of $184 million and producing $103 million after tax net realized gain.  It will be included in our fourth quarter results.", "Page 5 provides a comparative analysis of third quarter and year-to-date operating income and GAAP combined ratios.  Net favorable prior year reserve development was $202 million after tax in the current quarter, comparable to the prior year quarter, while all three of our business segments once again experienced favorable development as a result of better than expected loss experience, most of the $202 million related to business insurance.  ", "Within BI, reserve development included a $120 million after tax increase to asbestos reserve which was primarily driven by a slight increase in our assumption for projected defense costs related to many policyholders.  Overall the company\u2019s assessment of the underlying asbestos environment did not change in any significant way from recent periods.  An update to our asbestos reserve disclosures is also included as an appendix to this webcast presentation.", "The current quarter also benefited from a significant reduction in cap losses which were down to $103 million after tax as compared to $682 million after tax in the third quarter of last year when Hurricanes Ike, Gustav, and Dolly made landfall in the US.  Also impacting the current quarter was a $46 million after tax benefit from a re-estimation of current year loss ratios, mostly in BI due to better than expected frequency trends.", "Our GAAP combined ratios, whether as reported or as adjusted, speak to why we remain quite please with the underlying profitability of our businesses.  Net investment income of $616 million after tax is shown on Page 6 was $29 million higher than the prior year quarter.  This is the first time we\u2019ve seen quarter-over-quarter growth in NII in almost two years.  ", "The long term fixed income portfolio\u2019s after tax yield was 3.7%, consistent with the prior year quarter, while the short term portfolio yielded only 20 basis points, down from 170 basis points.  The non-fixed income portfolio yielded 4.3%, much better than the negative returns we had been experiencing since the third quarter of last year.  ", "The three major contributors to operating return on equity are shown on Page 7 of the webcast.  Fixed income NII less interest on corporate debt, what we refer to as the passage of time component, contributed 8.2 points year-to-date, down slightly from recent periods, primarily due to lower short term interest rates.", "Non fixed income NII, a much smaller contributor operating ROE, contributed a negative 0.6 points and underwriting income contributed 5 points.  Consistent with the analysis we provided in the second quarter webcast, year-to-date ROE included a 180 point negative impact from non-fixed income and short term yields.  Year-to-date, the non-fixed income portfolio yielded a negative 3.1% after tax rather than a more normal level of positive 7% and the short term rates averaged 30 basis points after tax rather than a more normal level of 2.5%.", "Nonetheless, cumulatively from January of 2005, we produced an average annual operating ROE of approximately 14.2% consistent with our stated longer term goal of mid-teens ROE.  ", "Before turning the mike over to Brian, I\u2019d like to say a few words about a subject that has become quite topical these days; inflation.  We\u2019ve heard a lot of speculation about the impact of inflation on P&C insurers.  Particularly on reserve levels for long tail lines of business, such as workers\u2019 comp and liability.  You should note that the nominal duration of our reserves for these lines may be less than you think; under 7 years for comp and under 6 years for liability.  ", "You should also note that examining the impact of inflation on the entire company is a very complex exercise, one that we continue to study and refine. While economists seem to indicate that inflation risk is low in the short term, longer term outlooks for inflation remain mixed.  So, we will continue to examine the potential impact of inflation on our company, along with action that should be considered.  ", "Now, Brian is going to provide some further insights into our results for the quarter.", "", "Brian W. MacLean", "Jay Fishman gave a broad overview of our market and I will go through the segment\u2019s specific results and I will start with some comments on renewal rates across the company.  ", "As Jay commented, the improvement in the renewal rate environment has been of particular importance and we are pleased that for the second consecutive quarter, all 3 business segments experienced positive rate change.  You can see on slide 8 that although none of these shifts are dramatic in any 1 quarter, they are a sign of consistent improvement.  This is particularly true in our commercial businesses, where we are at a very different point than we were 16 months ago.", "Turning to the business insurance segment on Slide 9, operating earnings were up from last year, primarily driven by reduced CAT activity and other favorable loss experience in the current year.  Adjusting for catastrophes and prior year developments, the year-to-date combined ratio was 94:5, or 60 basis points higher than last year.  This modest margin compression is significantly better than anticipated and reflective of a number of factors, including: better than expected pricing, better than expected loss trend primarily driven by frequency, and lower than normal non-CAT weather charges.", "Net written premiums are down 5% compared to the prior year.   This is a result of the economic contraction, which has led to a decrease in exposures.  As our insurance payrolls receipts and general business activity goes down, so does our premiums.  These impacts are consistent with our expectations and have been incorporated in our guidance.  Given the environment, we are extremely pleased with our top line results.  ", "Turning to the production statistics, on Slide 10, overall retentions remain strong with some modest decline in select accounts and modest improvement in commercial or middle market business.  The select retention is being driven by our pricing action, which you can see in the 3% increase in renewal premium levels.", "In commercial accounts and other business insurance, renewal premium changes were slightly negative, but underlying rate change was, again, positive and higher compared to last quarter.  You can see this in the next page, which takes the renewal premium change data and splits it into its two primary components:  pure rate and exposure change.", "Across all of business insurance, rate is continuing to improve, while exposure is declining.  With loss costs at or better than expected levels, margins continue to remain attractive.  New business results, shown on the next page are up 1% quarter over quarter.", "In select accounts, we\u2019ve been talking about a flat form rollout and that continues to drive significant new business in the small account side or small business part of this marketplace.", "In the individually underwritten businesses, which include the upper end of select commercial accounts and other business insurance, we continue to feel great about the flow of new opportunity.  But, in general, a little less bullish about market pricing.  ", "We continue to be very pleased with our effective execution and position in the marketplace.  Our ability to differentiate ourselves continues to demonstrate itself in our results. Our competitive advantages:  breadth of product, industry leading metrics, point-of-sale capabilities, and leadership position with independent agents, has never mattered more.  We have tremendous optimism about our opportunities and have strong controls and metrics to ensure we are executing appropriately.  ", "Although we continue to see the impact of the economic downturn in many of our businesses, we remain very pleased with the results this quarter and are well-positioned for the future.", "Moving to the financial professional and international insurance segments, Slide 13.  Operating earnings were up and the combined ratio was down, compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower catastrophe losses and improved large loss experience.  Across this segment, margins on a written basis are holding steady.  In most of those products where current margins indicate that we need rate, we are getting it.  ", "Net written premiums for the segment after adjusting for the impacted changes and foreign exchange rates, were down slightly in the quarter from the prior year; mainly due to fewer construction surety opportunities in the marketplace and disciplined underwriting in our professional liability book and business.  ", "While we had growth in our Ireland and Lloyd businesses, we feel very good about the top-line story in the segment and let me turn to Slide 14 to go over some production statistics.  Here you can see the reduction in surety premiums quarter over quarter, which is a result of decreased economic activity, particularly construction spending and underwriting.  We remain a clear market leader in this business and in these more challenging economic times; this has helped us to maintain our excellent profit margins.", "On the management liability side, the key dynamic continues to be the rate improvement inside renewal premium change.  Renewal premium has increased to 3%, but pure rate change at plus 4.  And we are particularly pleased about where we are able to get the rate.  Rate is up 10% on the financial institutions book and 4% on the professional liability book.  ", "We feel great about these rate improvements, but given the return levels on these products in the general marketplace, the strengthening was needed.  The tension is down quarter over quarter in the management liability business but the main driver here is disciplined underwriting to address meeting profitable targets. In our international business retention was down just slightly versus the prior year quarter again primarily a result of disciplined underwriting. Renewal change premium was positive with underlying rate improvement at 3%. New business is up double digits compared to the third quarter last year driven by continued strong growth and personal line product in Ireland. A critical component of this result is our ability to leverage the strength of our franchise and infuse talent and operational best practices from our U.S. personal insurance organization. ", "We continue to monitor the analysis on impact of the financial marketplace disruption on our management liability business which we've shared with you over the past couple of years and our conclusions remain the same. Our loss estimates continue to be within expectations and are incorporated in our current earnings guidance. Similar to business insurance overall, we\u2019re encouraged by our top line performance in loss costs are at or better than expectations. Particularly in light of the difficult economic conditions we remain very pleased with these results and believe we are in a great position as conditions improve.", "Turning to Slide 15, in personal insurance both the auto and property businesses continue to demonstrate sound fundamentals and sustained earnings power. Operating earnings are up dramatically from the same quarter last year due to less major CAT activity, that is there were no Atlantic hurricanes. Agency net written premiums which exclude any premiums attributable to our recently announced direct consumer initiative are up 1% compared to the prior year. By line the auto premiums are down 3% due to lower policy growth and retention resulting from our pricing discipline and property premiums are up 5% compared to the prior year due to the continued to the strong price change and new business growth. ", "Looking at Slide 16, agency auto combined ratio of 97 was consistent with third quarter 2008 with underlying current year favorable frequency trend. Agency properties combined ratio of 89 was 8 points higher than third quarter 2008 when adjusted for cats. It\u2019s important to note that although there was no impact from hurricanes in the current year quarter the aggregate impact of other weather events multiple wind and hail events generated total losses that were normal for the quarter. Additionally, the loss trend within these events was up compared to the prior year due to year over year increases in cost of labor and materials associated with weather related losses. ", "Turning to Slide 17 we continue to be pleased with our agency auto production results, especially in light of current market conditions. While policies enforce are down retention is essentially flat compared to third quarter 2008 with improved renewal premium change. New business volume has flattened out following 4 quarters of successive declines. Property production results remain strong across all of the metrics. We remain pleased with our ability to increase new business volumes while maintaining our margin advantage despite challenging market conditions. ", "So an interesting quarter, one could ask why we continue to feel great about our results and prospects going forward when general economic conditions remain difficult and the marketplace disruption which negatively impacted some of our major competitors has lessened. Well look at our results, our top line is down marginally but fundamentally due to contraction in the economy and we believe we are still growing share. Our retentions remain strong.  We continue to see rate improvement in all the business segments and our margins are well within target. These are the same general trends we've been seeing over the past several years and we believe these results are less about near term economic or insurance market place conditions and more about the capabilities and advantages we've been building for years. It\u2019s clear to us that customers continue to be concerned with the quality and financial stability of their insurance provider our competitive advantages matter and fundamentally that's what's driving our strong results and bullish attitude. ", "With that let me turn it back to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Brian.  Given our third quarter performance and its implications for the remainder of the year we\u2019re increasing our guidance for fully diluted operating income per share for full year 2009 to a range $5.30 to $5.50 compared to our previously announced range of $4.80 to $5.05. As indicated on page 18 our guidance assumes fourth quarter cap losses of $83 million after tax or $0.15 per diluted share. No additional prior year reserve developments, either favorable or unfavorable. No significant changes in short term interest rates from their extremely low current levels. No significant change in private equity and hedge fund valuations for the remainder of the year as we are assuming unchanged capital market conditions. Lower real estate partnership valuations due to continuing downward trend in commercial real estate values. Fourth quarter share purchases of a $1.5 billion bringing the total assumed for the year to $3.3 billion of share purchases. No significant change in average invested assets, ex unrealized gains and losses, and finally awaited average diluted share count of approximately 570 million. ", "With that let me turn it back to Jay.", "Jay Fishman", "Jay, thank you. Before we open it up to questions let me just attempt to preempt one. That is we have no investment in the Gallient Funds and we have no insurance exposure to the Gallient Funds and hopefully that will address a question that a number of you would ask.

", "Jay Fishman", "", "We\u2019re reluctant Jay to make predictions of cash flow or capital needs. The world is volatile, storms come and go. The only observation that I\u2019d make is that we repurchased $8 billion over a 3 year period. We started the program in the middle of \u201806 we\u2019re obviously middle of \u201809 and that included at least 1 bad year in the catastrophe arena. So we\u2019re just going to keep doing what we\u2019ve been doing which is to produce our earnings measuring our excess capital and returning it and it will go as long as it needs to go and when we\u2019re done if things are looking good we\u2019ll reauthorize some more.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "", "I\u2019ll come at it another way. Is there an upper boundary that Travelers is comfortable with in terms of debt to capital ratio if its 20% currently?", "Jay Fishman", "The range that we operate our debt to capital ratio in is we talked about before is a 15% to 25% range. That\u2019s a little more complicated than that because each one of the rating agencies has their own real formula, but the proxy for all of them is about 20%.  I\u2019m sorry 15% to 25% and we\u2019ve selected to be in the middle of the range, but we could certainly be comfortable higher but at this point we\u2019re at the 20 and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been for a while.", "Jay Benet", "Yes but Jay I wouldn\u2019t anticipate us raising our debt to capital ratios for the purpose of buying back shares. We are at a level from an operating perspective that we\u2019re quite comfortable with and that additional debt capacity I think is the way the prudent and thoughtful financial companies manage themselves. So the answer is we would not leverage up the company that extra 5 points which would take to the edge of the rating range for the purpose of repurchasing shares.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "That\u2019s helpful and then more broadly, could you talk about to what extent we might see some recovery in premium volume as the economy recovers. I guess what I\u2019m getting at is, is insurance buying trends more of a midcycle or even late cycle reflection within a recovering economy?", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Well I\u2019m not sure, I mean we are very driven by payroll numbers obviously and business receipts and so I haven\u2019t really thought about that one very much Jay and I\u2019d like to think about it some more. My immediate reaction to is that we\u2019re more lagger than a leader but again it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve thought about a great deal. I don\u2019t think we have and want to think about it some more. A number of these things will initially show up in audit premium in ordered adjustments so a company will make an estimate of their payroll or their receipts at the beginning of the policy period and in the event that you end up with meaningfully different economic activity and in fact payrolls changed you can end up with an adjusted reflecting additional premium down the road.  Again, my guess would be more of a follower than a leader but we should think about that some more.

", "Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer & Co.", "Could you explain the re-estimation of loss estimates on the 2009 business segment?  What I\u2019m basically trying to figure out here is if the re-estimation was frequency driven, was it related to the short tailed lines mostly written at the beginning of the year that you assume will mature before next hurricane season or was it something else?", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019ll answer it by first attempting to say how we go about doing this whole thing.  We start the year with an estimate of what we think our loss ratios are going to be relative to the premiums we\u2019re going to write for each one of our lines of business and as the year progresses, we evaluate information, whether it\u2019s frequency statistics, severity statistics, or pricing and everything else that goes into what comprises a loss ratio and evaluate whether we should be moving off of what we refer to as the initial loss [fic].  As the year progressed, we did see frequency trends in several different areas were much lower than we had expected them to be and we adjusted the loss [fic] accordingly and what happens when you adjust the loss [fic] in the third quarter, you start evaluating is it relating exclusivity to activity that\u2019s taking place in the third quarter or is this information that\u2019s telling you that you need it to look back to the first and second quarter and effectively have a catch up adjustment, so for the purposes of transparency, recognizing these changes in estimate are recurring elements of our business and everybody else\u2019s business.  We just want to make sure that we provide you with that information and you see that historically we provide very granular information about prior year development and this is a similar thing but it deals with prior quarters of the current year.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Mike, this is Brian.  It is looking at frequency trends that have emerged over the year but not just on the short tail stuff. Comp was a decent part of this process too, so it\u2019s frequency driven by more across all the lines of business.", "Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer & Co.", "I guess the comment in the opening about inflation and talking about longer duration lines, I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re reconciling your outlook on inflation with these longer tailed lines if maybe severity is going to potentially be a driver in those longer tailed lines.", "Jay Fishman", "To back up for a second, I\u2019m not sure that we actually have an outlook on inflation meaning that\u2019s substantively process wise different from anything that we\u2019ve ever done, meaning we always make estimations of loss costs over the lifetime of a block of businesses that are being written, so we think about comp pays and we think about general liability pays this year, we think about it last year, we think about it 10 years ago, and we\u2019re always making estimations of what future claim costs will be and we haven\u2019t changed anything in particular relative to a different focus on inflation than we have before.  I just want to make sure that we\u2019re clear on this.  ", "We haven\u2019t changed anything other than to begin to recognize that you all seem to have an interest in talking about inflation and the point that Jay made which I think is actually quite consistent with Brian\u2019s comments is that the duration of even our long tail liabilities is shorter than most people tend to think, meaning that there is a significant amount of cash disbursement claim payment that takes place in the very early part of the cycle, the tail of the payment cycle. The tail may be quite long but significant amounts of the payments are done early and so it\u2019s not difficult to get an early read of both frequency and severity even in long tail lines.  I hope that\u2019s clear.

I\u2019m specifically wondering if that is something that we should be looking at beyond asbestos and I have had a couple of companies that have mentioned something along those lines.

Historically you\u2019ve heard us talk about settling large cases, getting them off the books through final settlement, and that process was something that was very big in recent years and has tailed off as we\u2019ve really gotten away from having these large exposures.  So what we\u2019re really left with we refer to more as a frequency book if you will.", "What we try to describe in the disclosures and hopefully it came across is we\u2019re making projections.  Those projections are going out over time.  If you think about a graph with a sloping line of costs and claims and things of that sort, we\u2019re periodically re-evaluating what the slope of that line is. We\u2019re not seeing any major change in the environment, but what we are seeing is a little higher amount of defense costs on policy holders and our projections over the many years that relate to asbestos, we have to take that into account, it\u2019s not related to any one policy holder or any handful of policy holders.  It\u2019s spread out over a big base.  So when you apply the base and the increment, we get essentially what you\u2019re seeing here.", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019m looking at Doreen to see in fact \u2013 I haven\u2019t heard anything about a perception of increased defense costs around the organization in the rest of our claims.  Is there anything that you\u2019re aware of, Doreen?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "No.  Good morning everybody.  Apart from asbestos and what Jay Benet just said, we actually don\u2019t see any increase in defense costs and I\u2019ll give you a couple of different categories that we watch.  We watch the ratio between [inaudible] losses and claims and see whether we\u2019re seeing more of those or less of those, so we watch that ratio.", "The other thing we look at is how many of the cases we can have our staff counsel defend which our in-house lawyers that are licensed around the country and those typically drive a different cost structure as well, and we\u2019ve improved the penetration of those cases going to staff counsel so we actually don\u2019t see that trend at all and see it probably a little bit of the other way.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "That\u2019s great.

As far as residential contractors in particular, we\u2019re certainly not a big player in the liability lines for residential contractors.  If your question specifically is regarding the Chinese drywall situation, we talked about that a little bit on the last call and my recollection is that most of it is going back to what was it, do you remember the dates, Doreen?", "", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Good morning again. We did speak about this.  I think it was in response to a question that John answered.  There really hasn't been material change to what we spoke about last quarter.  We do have some claims but it's a very low volume of claims for Chinese drywall.", "And just as a reminder, I think John already mentioned we do not have a significant book of business with residential contractors or foreign manufacturers.  And those are really the two primary targets.  There's been about 700 lawsuits filed around the country.  And we have really a very small number of insureds that have been brought into that and they are primarily either importers or property managers, things of that sort.", "And it's basically - it's like an '06 issue.  There's been a lot of restrictions from the consumer protection federal organization since '08.  And most of the exposure as we see it when the reports are published like about 60% of the assumptions are in Florida homes.  So you start kind of whittling down the time period where the materials were used and who the targets are of the litigations.  And really what we're seeing is pretty much what we expected we would see given our book of business.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "And Doreen, and if you're not comfortable because we're doing this very real time, just when you look at the accounts that have had some claim activity, what would you guesstimate the average annual general liability limit to be?  I'm not presuming that the [polishes] will respond.  But a very natural question is what level of limits could be exposed to those sorts of claims?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "They're very consistent with our usual limits, $1 million to $2 million.  And the other thing I'd say is there are several home owner claims, but even that they're very, very small numbers.  And generally first party contracts do not cover the kind of exposures as well.", "Jay Fishman", "But we'll always look at every individual claim as we always do.  We make no general policy statements.  We treat each claim individually as it comes in and we make determinations.  So don't read this into a determination of claim handling activity.

And if any changes occur in prior quarters we'll of course update the information.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "I guess one follow-up with respect to this question is does most of your, with the exposure that you have to contractors be primarily admitted or non-admitted paper?", "Jay Fishman", "", "Most of it would be admitted.", "Matthew Heimermann - JPMorgan", "If I can speak\u2026", "Jay Benet", "Let me come back for a second because it's important.  And typically when we're asked questions we answer with data.  This is just so early that it's difficult to do that.  But if you go back to a matter of underwriting orientation, the kinds of accounts that over a long period of time we've written versus what we've not written is as you've described it.  Residential contractors have not been in that segment of the business that we have had a significant orientation to.  It's really been, and I'm doing this to some extent by memory and anecdotally, but it is largely by exception rather than as a class of business that we sought to write.", "Jay Fishman", "That's correct.

So we're really going to focus on profitability and get rate where we can and avoid the exposures where we can.", "Matthew Heimermann- JPMorgan", "I guess, I was just curious if there were any classes or industry categories in particular that you're feeling more or less optimistic about.", "Jay Fishman", "There's definitely some variability among the classes of business but I'd say overall it's a pretty consistent story.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Jay Cohen - Bank of America.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America", "A couple questions - first is on the Verisk transaction you talked about your expected realized gain.

In fact, as of 9/30, within the unrealized gain that I mentioned before $3.4 billion, there is an unrealized gain associated with Verisk.

I mean, and start with broadly, yes, we have insights but we also will readily admit that those insights are far from perfect.  So we're constantly trying to figure out as best we can why.  Comp frequency, the industry data out there and ours is similar to it.  It's very, very favorable.  Probably some of that is the economy but probably not exclusively.", "Auto frequency to us continues to look like all of the economics statistics would lead you to think which is as miles driven goes up then frequency should go up a little, etc.  But so those all seem to be in line.  But we absolutely don't have perfect insight into why.  We have been looking at an extended period of positive for the industry, as in good, frequency trends and we just keep looking at it.", "Jay Fishman", "And it's predominantly I would say speculation on our part because we can't.  There's no way to really prove this.  We speculate that part of the comp story is embedded in the economy moving increasingly away from the manufacturing base and increasingly to a service and office space.  Those are just things that you, that seem somewhat obvious.  But there are so many lines that have been the beneficiary of decreasing frequency.", "It does seem to be systemic and behavioral.  That doesn't mean absolute and comprehensive.  That just means that it's a phenomena that is occurring.  And all we have, I think, is informed insight rather than a real substantive understanding of why.  But there are certainly a behavioral dynamic to it that's been suspended.", "Brian W. Maclean", "But with that said, we've been seeing frequency, positive frequency for quite a while.  Have the latest economic conditions made that a little more positive?

So we have terrific visibility into it.", "I think going more granular, providing insight and information that is more granular to all of you is disclosure that goes beyond thoughtful competitive positioning.  You're talking about our pricing strategy in the market.

I\u2019m not sure that we project out and disclose what our excess capital is.  What we really do is try to describe a philosophy.  And the philosophy has been to start with the operating company capital levels and make sure that relative to the targets we set that those operating companies are at or above target and the profitability of the company that you are seeing in the third quarter and year-to-date is providing capital in those companies that are at or above the target levels.  We then look at, as we talked about earlier, taking out of the operating companies what we don\u2019t need, bringing it up to the holding company and having a debt-to-capital ratio that is targeted at the 20%.  And then managing our holding company cash to have $1.1 billion of holding company cash, which represents a year\u2019s worth of interest and dividends.  And, as you can see, at the end of the third quarter, we are sitting there with, I think, is about $2.6 billion dollars of holding company cash.", "So at a minimum, you can look at third quarter, and say, \u201cWell, at the holding company cash level relative to the target, we\u2019ve got an extra $1.5 billion.\u201d  We\u2019ve already talked about having a $1.5 billion share repurchases in the fourth quarter, but, then, all the dynamics are going to keep working within the company in the terms of profitability and whatever.

I guess that was my real question.", "Jay Fishman", "", "As Jay said before, we are not projecting out what, exactly, we are going to do.  We will think about that as part of any kind of guidance discussion we have for next year.  But I would say it\u2019s premature at this point in time.", "Vinay Misquith\u2013 Credit Suisse", "", "Fair enough.  The second question was on the investment portfolio, you had a secure and better [inaudible] portfolio than what appears.  Are you now willing to take on more risk, now that the market has stabilized?", "Jay Fishman", "", "We\u2019ve said, in the past, that, and I\u2019ll describe it as on the margin, that we were certainly willing,  if we were being appropriately compensated, to take on what you describe as greater risk/greater volatility portfolio.  But, fundamentally, it would be on the margin.  It wouldn\u2019t be a substantive shift in the strategy of the company.  I give enormous credit to Dave Roland, to Damien, and to Bill Hannon, in that there is never an issue. Our investment organization is there to make us an effective insurance company; not the other way around.  And so our goal is to take only that level of risk that we need to, to be a successful insurance company.  But, even at that, to be paid to take that risk appropriately.  ", "At the point in time we often ask about alternative investments, the fact is that what we consider the quality names in that space, continue to have a capital capacity themselves, uncalled facilities they are still working on.  So the fundraising that has been going on in both the hedge fund and private equity areas has actually been quite minimal.  And so the opportunity to actually commit additional dollars to the alternative investments, even if we thought we were getting appropriately paid for that, right now just isn\u2019t there.  They are not in the fundraising business.", "Another point, which we watch periodically, you actually take a look at spread between, say broadly, between BBB and AAA.  What you\u2019ll actually find right now is that they have tightened considerably.  And, from some stuff I was just looking at this morning, you\u2019ve got BBB spreads actually down to about 118 basis points over AAA; coming off of a position of almost 200 basis points as little as 6 to 8 weeks ago.  ", "I know Bill is chomping at the bit, and Bill, I will give you the opportunity.  But, that is just not for us at the moment.  Go ahead, Bill.", "Bill Hannon", "", "I wouldn\u2019t add much to that, actually.  We think in the last 3 or 4 months, risk is once again priced pretty tight.  We committed a fair amount to credit in the latter part of last year and that\u2019s worked out.  But, right now, we are in a pretty conservative mode, and, if anything, we are increasing the credit quality in the portfolio.  We have sold marginal names in the last 6 weeks.", "Jay Fishman", "", "And, in fact, on the margin again, shortened the portfolio a little over the last, what Bill, 3 or 4 months?", "Bill Hannon", "", "Yes.  Duration has come down from the last quarter.  Counting the short term, it\u2019s probably at about 3.7, which is historically low for us and about where we like it to be.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS.  ", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Good morning everybody.  A couple quick questions for you.  First one, on the surety business; you talk about premiums down because of, obviously, construction activity declining, but what do you think that means for potential increase in loss activity over the next 10 to 12 months and are you reserving for any expectations of increased loss activity in that line?", "Alan D. Schnitzer ", "", "The margins on those businesses continue to perform very well and we manage that book and we have managed that book going back several years very carefully.  So from a historical perspective, our view of the credit scoring of those businesses is actually at a near all-time high.  We feel, right now, it could deteriorate, we\u2019ll see where that goes.  But, from a historical perspective our credit outlook is very good.  We certainly consider that and we take it into account as we price in reserve.", "Brian W. MacLean ", "", "This is Brian.  I mean, we\u2019ve talked about this in the past, but our surety business, we are more involved with the ongoing operations of our accounts than in any other line of business and we understand your question and appreciate that in segments of the industry there could be concerns as contractors start to stretch and bid on jobs that they maybe normally wouldn\u2019t do.  We are really confident that that is not happening in our book and --", "Jay Fishman", "", "And to show you, actually, the level of attention it\u2019s getting, because Alan started,  Brian answered, and I\u2019ll chime in a little bit too, here.  What people often forget, particularly in a large construction surety business, is that we are dealing with partially collateralized obligations.  Meaning, we have an obligation to finish a project, we have an obligation to finish a project that the contractor defaults, but we step in to the remainder of the proceeds that are obligated to the project from the owner.  Which, in many cases, are governmental, state authorities, and things of that nature.  ", "And so to Brian\u2019s point, the real core issue, the real core underwriting issue is:  How good is the bidding?  How aggressive has it become?  And we are pretty good at being involved in the bidding process of our primary accounts.  And then, being on-scene and on-site to make sure that the project doesn\u2019t get upside down; to make sure that the payments are being made consistent with the project flow; the work is being done appropriately, because our risk stands in if it gets out of kilter; if the remainder of the proceeds can\u2019t provide enough to finish the project.  And so it is often misunderstood in the analytical community that somehow we have this enormous, uncollateralized exposure if someone defaults.  That\u2019s just not how the business really works.", "Jay Benet", "", "For most of our surety clients, we understand their businesses and their exposures as well as they do.  So we\u2019re intimately involved.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "", "Great.  Next question, can you give us your view on what you think the M&A environment is going to look like for the P&C industry for the next 12 months, and how does Travelers fit into that?", "Jay Fishman", "", "You probably have as good an insight into that as I do.  Obviously, with the government stepping in, in the last 12 months, the way they have done.  They have taken what would, I think, have otherwise been a more robust merger and acquisition environment and created lifelines for a number of companies to continue to do business.  So again, I\u2019ll come back to this.  Our focus is just given what we\u2019ve been able to do and how well we are performing, our focus continues to be what we can do internally.  And we\u2019re just going to keep doing this, and that doesn\u2019t mean, as I say all the time, that we don\u2019t look at things and we're not thoughtful about it.  ", "But we're probably the best acquirer in the business.  We're certainly the most experienced.  And so our view is that we have the skills to be able to do it if opportunities emerge.  But on the other hand we also understand that the risk involved in those things is significant and we're always going to measure that risk against its potential return.  But I don't know.  It's just such a remarkable, unique, one and only environment.  I'm just - obviously none of us have seen anything like this so it's very difficult to really understand what the next couple years looks like.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Wanted to follow up on the retention and select accounts.  I understand what you're saying that you've pushed pricing there.  But pricing is up in really most of your lines and they're not seeing the same retention impact.  So I'm wondering if there's a reason it's making more of a difference in Select.", "And to be honest, my guess is I would have thought it would have been better in Select just because you have more overlap there with Hartford and I would have thought with their troubles you would have had a lot of nervous agents approach you for book rolls and things like that that would have helped your retention in select.  So can you discuss a little bit more why select had more of a retention [inaudible] than the other lines?", "Jay Fishman", "And there are really two separate issues to be discussed.  The first is in Select Express the important element there is that the advent of that platform broadened out our underwriting orientation significantly.  I don't have the statistics at hand but before we had select express the concentration of our business and what we referred to internally as the BOBS, businesses, offices, building and stores was significant.  And Travelers Express broadened that out by a fair amount.", "And as a consequence we ended up much as we did in [Quantum].  And I do think of this as a [Quantum] like program.  It's a [multivaried] program that's being applied in areas where our own expertise isn't - our own experience, expertise, good experience, not deep or unexperiences in deep.  What we're seeing now is the beginning of loss patterns.  And so we are getting a whole lot smarter very quickly about in some of these classes where we need price and where we can have price accommodation.", "And so what you're seeing on the small commercial business is a price-driven behavior based upon underlying data that we now see and can make thoughtful pricing decisions about and the impact that that's having on some renewable accounts in the marketplace.  And that's to be expected.  There isn't anything that's going on here that one wouldn't anticipate in the roll out of a new multivaried product that expands underwriting appetite orientation beyond historical patterns.", "So we're expecting it and for those who would ask if that's showing up.  I would say predominantly that phenomenon is showing up predominantly in commercial multi peril in our Select Express business and nothing that we wouldn't have anticipated.", "The other piece of it is in the non - Select actually has two elements.  There's the extraordinary flow business that flows into Express, very small accounts, not much touch.  And then there's a larger end of small accounts that actually that we refer to as plus.  And that business does require more of a union touch.", "The plus business we find ourselves and always have competing more with regional carriers, local and regional carriers who actually perceive that plus business as the equivalent of their middle market.  And as the market has heated up a little bit we've seen some additional price competitiveness in the plus accounts.  And as we do everywhere else, we kind of draw the line and we decide where we're going to respond and where we're not.  And so the answer, Ian, is in those two elements.  One being in Select Express as we drive our pricing strategy to more accurately reflect the pricing experience and one being in plus that perhaps, I'm speculating here, but it's perhaps indicative of a little more aggressive competition in that kind of regional market and middle market business.", "Jay Benet", "That's absolutely correct.  I guess the only other thing I would add is that while you'll see on Slide 10 the retention in Select moving down by one point, you also see the renewal premium change going up by two points, which is in fact driven in large measure by the pricing dynamic that's going on in the [inaudible] arena.  So you can see both sides of the issue right there.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "I guess I\u2019m just looking year-over-year it's down from 82 to 79.  Do you feel like we're towards, we're mostly through those two impacts?  Or are we maybe in the middle and maybe it can tick down towards the mid 70s before it bottoms out?", "Jay Fishman", "I'd be reluctant to forecast what the retention would be going forward.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "I guess I meant specifically the impact of the Express reunderwriting.  Is that process mostly through?", "Jay Fishman", "I wouldn't refer to that as reunderwriting.  It is clearly not reunderwriting.  Actually it is much more about the same thing we do in every one of our businesses which is we get data, we incorporate it into our pricing strategy, we make pricing decisions.  We do that every day.  The only thing that's a bit different about Select Express, our classes of business that before the introduction of the product we didn't have the kind of in depth cost, loss experience, costing experience that we have in other lines.", "I don't know.  I'd be speculating.  We should get the answer and get back.  We can have a view on that.  It's now impossible.  I just haven't thought about that and haven't spoken with Mark or anyone else to have a perspective.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Just the last part, the Hartford part, you haven't seen the ability or nervous agents asking you to take more business in select because of that?", "Jay Benet", "I would say broadly.  We've talked in the past about how we track wins, losses and how we're doing against our major competition and that is still a very, very positive picture for us.  So we're seeing that activity with numerous names and continue to see it.  I'd say as the economy has gotten a little less anxiety than it had three to six months ago there's probably a little less anxiety in our marketplace.  But there's still a pretty strong concern with wanting to be with really solid carriers and worrying about the alternative.", "Jay Fishman", "The slides that we showed at investor day in terms of us being in a net gain position with really all of our major competitors\u2026", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "This is Alan Schnitzer.  I want to clarify a response to the question.  It was a question about professional liability.  And I just want to clarify that the disclosure in my response was related to a specific book of business within management liability.  I wouldn't want to leave anybody with the impression that my comments related to the larger management liability business, for example, the private non-profit business, which is our largest book of business and the management liability business overall it's a much different, much more favorable profitability dynamic.  So my comments were narrowly related to the professional liability book.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Operator?", "Operator", "Yes, ma'am?  I'm sorry.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Last question from Larry Greenberg.", "Operator", "Mr. Greenberg, your line is open.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "I know it's still very early in the initiative but can you share with us anything new, surprises relative to expectations in the direct to consumer initiative?  And then secondly, it's been a little while now since the management change in personal lines and small commercial.  Has there been any change in strategy or structure to that operation post that change?", "Jay Fishman", "Why don't I take the first and you take the second?  There's nothing new to report on our director consumer initiative.  We are clearly in the earliest of early days.  It is an R&D program.  As we promised, we continue to lose money on the program.  That we're being successful in that regard.  As reflected obviously in the package that you have, the long-term venture we've\u2026  Anne MacDonald is our new Chief Marketing Officer who is sitting at the end of the table and I'm now just more convinced that we're developing real insights, real perspectives on getting smarter.  But there's nothing new in the initiative to report.", "Jay Benet", "And on the management changes the short answer is that we're still moving along in the same direction as we were before.  Greg Toczydlowski has been in PI and was managing a lot of those operations [technical difficulty] insurance group and so strategically, no, we\u2019re just as we always have, we\u2019re constantly tweaking things and looking to imrove what we do, but no, there hasn\u2019t been any fundamental shift in strategy.", "Operator", "There are no more questions at this time so I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Nawi for closing remarks.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you\u2019ll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Friday, April 23, 2010.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our first quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the following on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes certain forward-looking information as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "All statements other than statements of historical facts maybe forward-looking statements. Specifically, our earnings guidance is forward-looking and we may make other forward-looking statements about the company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, the sufficiency of the company\u2019s reserves and other topics.", "The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from our current expectations due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release, and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention Travelers operating income, which we use as a measure of profit and other measures that maybe non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website.", "With that out of the way, here is a Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. All in, given the magnitude of catastrophes we experienced this quarter, we were quite pleased with our performance, reporting net income of $1.25 per diluted share, an increase of 13% from last year\u2019s quarter and a return on equity of nearly 10%.", "Included in this number was $0.61 a share in catastrophes, arising out of the multiple storms in the Eastern United States as well as the earthquake in Chile. Just to put this number in context, the estimate for catastrophes for the first quarter included in our previously provided guidance was about $0.13 a share.", "Offsetting the cats we benefited from favorable prior year development, and our underlying performance from both underwriting and net investment income was a bit better than our expectations. The net result was operating income, which was in line with our expectations going into the quarter, allowing us to reaffirm our previously issued fully year 2010 operating earnings per share guidance.", "Also it\u2019s reflective of our continuing strong earnings power. In an environment which remains similar to last quarter in terms of both economic and insurance market conditions, our business dynamics from a solid and we are generally consistent with recent operating experience.", "Renewal rate gains remained positive in each of our business segments, retention was strong and the business in total remained on par with last year\u2019s quarter. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter, and announced the increase in our regularly quarterly dividend by 9% to $0.36 per share. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders.", "Given that our operating dynamics this quarter were generally consistent with recent quarters, our call this morning is going to be somewhat different than in the past. We are still providing all of the same information in our presentation as we have previously, but we will not be going page by page with you, so as to have more time for questions.", "Before turning over to Jay, I want to take just a minute to acknowledge and thank our claim department for all of their exceptional work, not only this quarter but over the last couple of years. In 2008, we had Ike Gustav in Dally, and while there were no major storms in 2009 it was still a quite active cat year. Of course, in the first quarter of 2010 we were again faced with an exceptional number of claims due to the multiple storms on the East Coast.", "[Inaudible] and her entire claim team have been remarkably busy providing industry meeting customer service to our insureds, and again demonstrating our commitment to providing high quality service to all of our insureds during their greatest time of need.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. There are several points that I\u2019d like to highlight relating to pages zero to seven, many of which you\u2019ve heard me say repeatedly over many quarters. First, our balance sheet remained extremely strong. All capital leverage and liquidity measures were half or better than target level.", "Even after repurchasing $1.4 billion of our stock and paying dividends of $168 million in the quarter, holding company liquidity increased to over $3 billion, almost three times on a target level due to the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our parent company. Holding company liquidity is expected to move towards its target level during the remainder of the year as we continue our share repurchases.", "Book value for share increased once again, and on an as reported basis operating income for the quarter did meet our expectations; that is operating performance ex the caps and ex the non-cap weather, and also adjusting for the favorable reserve development, but including net investment income, all of that was inline with our expectations going into the quarter.", "Despite the high cap losses and the relatively low yield on short term and non fixed income investments, we recorded a double digit operating ROE, and finally our results included one time tax charge of just under $12 million or approximately $0.02 per share, related to the recently and acted federal health care legislation that eliminated the tax benefit associated with Medicare Part D subsidies.", "Brian is now going to provide some color about our operating performance.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks Jay. We have included on pages eight through 16, all of the segment performance statistics that we traditionally discussed with you. As Jay mentioned we are not going to go through each slide, but instead speaks more broadly about the significant drivers for the quarter leaving more time for question.", "Obviously weather had a big impact on our results and will be the headline for the quarter. We had six domestic cat events, the two largest being the February snow storm in the Mid Atlantic that paralyzed Washington DC for several days; and then Easter in mid March that impacted New York, New Jersey and Southern New England. In addition there were several international events, the largest being the earthquake in Chile, so all-and-all a very active catastrophe quarter.", "But looking beyond the near term impact of weather, our production in core underwriting results continue to perform very well. In business insurance, the tensions remain strong and were up slightly across the business, renewal pricing improved modestly, with pure rate continuing to be positive for the segment, exposure change on renewed accounts were still down, but the rate of decline moderated slightly from last quarter.", "On the new business side, we feel good about the continued flow of new opportunities, particularly in middle market and the small end of select. New business writings in the quarter were down from prior year, primarily due to the pricing discipline we are maintaining in the larger end of the select business. This segment of the market has been particularly competitive and reduced writings here reflect that position.", "On a written basis premiums are down, a direct result of the impact of the challenging economy on our customers. Some of that impact is seen in renewal premium statistics, but the majority comes from reduced audit premiums, and increased cancellations and endorsements. These impacts either emerge over the life of the policy or in the case of audits, aren\u2019t reflected until the end of the policy period.", "Since we are generally auditing the accounts we wrote a full year ago, we expect this drag may continue to the next few quarters. As the economy stabilizes and eventually improves, we believe that based on our historical experience the audit premium will rebound.", "There are a lot of weather and prior year impacts in the combined ratio. Excluding these we are experiencing the modest deterioration we had expected. Frequency remains while claims severity is relatively benign, and pure loss trend is marginally outpacing our modest rate gains. This deterioration is somewhat larger than the 30 basis point change in the adjusted combined ratio on the slide, because the first quarter of 2009 does not include the positive impact of the adjustment we made to the full year \u201909 combined ratio in the second half of last year.", "Moving to the financial professional and international segment, net written premiums after adjusting for the impact of changes and foreign exchange rates, were up significantly for the quarter. The primary driver of this increase was less seated premium year-over-year, resulting mainly from changes in the structure of our reinsurance, that directionally aligned retentions in our international business, with the company\u2019s US retention practices, and to a lesser extent lower reinsurance costs.", "For the second consecutive quarter, we did see quarter over quarter growth in our construction surety book of business due to activity in our large national accounts market. In our international business, new business is up compared to the prior year quarter, primarily due to growth in marine and accident and special risk products and the like.", "Operating earnings in the quarter were down from the prior year quarter, as a result of our exposure to multiple international named events, primarily the Chilean earthquake. The losses we experienced were consistent with the fact the Chilean earthquake was the seventh largest recorded, and was 500 times stronger than the earthquake in Heidi.", "Turning to personal auto, agency retention remains strong and the renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business improved significantly, and it was at the highest level in the last five quarters. We believe that the new business declines that we saw in the previous quarters were due to the fact that we were ahead of the market in seeking increased rate. You can see from the change in agency autos quarter-over-quarter combined ratio, that profitability has improved as rate gains are now outpacing the lost cost. ", "Approximately one point of this improvement was attributable to lower frequency, which we believe was a result of the winter storms impact on miles driven. After normalizing for the quarter\u2019s frequency, core auto margins are improving and well within company targets.", "Within agency property the story this quarter was clearly the weather. Adjusting for the weather the combined ratio for the quarter was modestly higher compared to the prior year quarter, a portion of which is the expected slight margin compression. This compression continues to be driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles.", "Agency property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. It continues to steadily grow with strong retention and continued positive renewal premium change, and new business is up significantly compared to the same quarter last year.", "So even with an extraordinary number of catastrophic events in the quarter, we posted solid results. Core combined ratios remain within company targets, new business remains robust despite the challenging macro economic conditions; rate overall remains positive and retentions continue to be strong.", "We believe that these results are direct outcome of long-term capability and competitive advantages we have built, as exemplified by our claim response this quarter. These capabilities are sustainable and will continue to differentiate Travelers with independent agents, customers and brokers.", "Now before I turn it back to Jay Benet, let me touch on an issue that\u2019s gotten a good bit of press. On page 17, we\u2019ve outlined why we believe our exposure to Chinese drywall will not be problematic.", "First, from a business profile prospective, we have no direct liability exposure to Chinese drywall manufacturers, and have virtually no general liability exposure to US residential contractors. In fact, we have no general liability exposure to 37 of the 38 US residential contractors identified in Bloomberg, and the one we do right has in SAR and our limits above that are minimal.", "On the homeowner side, we are disproportionately under represented in the states with significant impacts. So we do not expect the significant number of claims, but given our policy structure limits profile, we believe any losses should be contained.", "Additionally, the fact that there is very strong product ID here its helpful. That is, we know where it is, where it came from, and when it got here, and all of this should help limit this claim activity. To date we\u2019ve gotten 52 claims and we are comfortable our overall exposure is not problematic.", "Now with that, let me turn it back to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Page 18 sets forth our guidance for full year 2010\u2019s fully diluted operating income per share, which is a range from $5.20 to $5.55, unchanged from what we previously provided, which in round numbers should translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11%. We are now assuming cat losses of $640 million after tax or $1.30 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cat losses for the first quarter and our original estimates for quarters two through four.", "No further estimates of prior year reserved development either favorable or unfavorable; a low single digit decrease in average invested assets ex-unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to share repurchases; full year share repurchases that are still in the range of $3.50 to $4.0 billion; and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases and employee equity awards in the range of $490 million to $495 million shares, which is a bit higher than we what we had previously assumed through the impact of the recent increase in the price of our shares.", "Before I close, let me explain in response to several questions we have been asked, why we did not prerelease this quarter\u2019s cat losses? We write cat exposures as part of the ordinary course of our business, and cat losses are just one of the number of items that could impact the quarter\u2019s results.", "We think it is more informative generally to release all of our results together so that the information is presented in context. This is particularly true in a quarter like this, when the cat losses came from a number of relatively smaller events and we have losses from seven cats in the quarter as Brian said, some of which occurred very late in the quarter.", "It\u2019s also our strong preference to take the time to acquire regular quarterly closing process to our result before we announce. This approach makes more sense for a company of the size that we are now, especially in a quarter when we had a number of moving pieces and our performance on an overall basis was generally consistent with our expectations.", "Finally this approach is also consistent with the overtime nature of the company\u2019s stated financial objective, and our previously disclosed intention to stop giving guidance beyond this year.", "So with that, I believe Jay has a closing comment he would like to make.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay, just one more comment before we open it up to questions. You may have noticed that a number of our senior executives have over the last year or so, sold some of their shares and I wanted to take the opportunity to clarify our views.", "Our senior executives receive a meaningful portion of their compensation in the form of performance-based equity. As a result of that, as well as our recent performance, all of our named executive officers and substantially all of our senior executives, have equity positions that are well in excess of the company\u2019s ownership requirements. This actually has been the case for quite some time.", "The recent financial crisis underscored for all of us the importance of prudent personal financial planning and diversification. Given this and our significant executive ownership, we don\u2019t discourage executive sales driven by personal financial decisions, as long as the minimum share ownership requirements continue to be met.", "With that operator, we\u2019ll open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer-Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions)", "Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks. Jay can you talk about the expectation for continued improvement in the accident year of combined ratios, ex caps. We saw that in the first quarter, and just given the kind of environment, I\u2019m trying to get a sense of whether you anticipate that continuing through the year?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I think when we look at each one of the segments, there is probably a bit of a different story. We had talked about some rate gains in the BI segments that had been in our written premium back in the second half of last year, and of course that\u2019ll get earned in along with the rate gains that we have seen in the first quarter.", "Relative to lost trend, I think as Brian said earlier, the loss trend, it\u2019s running at a benign levels. So probably running a little bit ahead of where the rate gains has been so. We would expect in terms of just the underlying trends in our business, if you see some margin compression of a modest amount in the BI segment.", "Now if you flip to the other extreme and look at Pi, Pi is in a different position. Pi has been experiencing rate gains for a period of time, and as those earn in and the loss costs remained pretty benign in that business, I think we\u2019d see some margin expansion there, again all things being equal. All of this is going to be dependent upon the weather and loss activity that you heard of talk about from quarter to quarter, but I think just overall slight expansion. Brian do you want to add something there?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, and Jay\u2019s comments there in PI is auto. As I said in my comments, on the home owner\u2019s side, there is a little bit of a margin compression on the auto side; we definitely got to experience it.", "Jay Benet", "Jay if you go back to the previously issue guidance that we were referring this morning, what we said at that time was that we expected for the organization overall total consolidated, that we expected modest -- I think was the word we used, deterioration in the loss and LAE ratio for the organization overall, and that\u2019s still our underlying premise imbedded in the guidance.", "Jay Fishman", "The other segment that we should comment on is the FTII segment. Of course there is a very diverse mix of business there, but you can say like BI, perhaps there is a slight level of margin compression as well.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Okay, and then my follow-up is on the expense ratio. Now having told its 33%, are you comfortable with that level of expense ratio, and if so maybe you can talk about what investments are driving that?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, Jay this is Brian. Yes the exact ratio is going to bounce around quarter- to-quarter as premium volumes move and there are other miscellaneous things going through on the expense side.", "But we have been making significant investments in our platforms across a lot of our businesses, probably the most obvious are in small commercial and in the personal arena where the product and platform are a significant part of our market place proposition. But even the cross middle market we\u2019ve been doing a lot of different things to connect with capabilities that we have in the market place. So that is another area of investment.", "Jay Benet", "We also get a little reluctant in answering with respect to specific elements of the cost structure. Lost hours are mitigated or generated by investments, so expense and loss ratio which just can\u2019t be looked at, we don\u2019t think in separate pieces so we get back to returns on equity and are we satisfied with our overall returns in our business current returns as well as long term prospects? The answer is yes, we very much are.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS, please proceed.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Good morning everybody. Two quick questions here for you. First one, Brian can you talk about trends in personal auto insurance and given that your combined ratios now are down to a more than acceptable level? Should we expect to start seeing you guys, that number stabilized and maybe give us some of the dynamics right now in the personal auto insurance market where there are some competitors with really high combined ratios, and then perhaps maybe picking up some share here going forward?", "Jay Benet", "Yes, we definitely do feel that way. Greg Toczydlowski is sitting here by my throat, have him talk about that a little bit.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Yes Brian. As he indicated we are feeling comfortable with the margins. We watched two primary factors, that the whole of our quote information, and we can clearly see that our quote flow is off and then we look at the competitiveness of our core activities, specifically in comparative raters and we can see that our closed ratio is also up this quarter.", "If you look at the stat supplement, you can see the output of that, that we do have sequential gain in TIF from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. So as we\u2019ve got those margins right in the middle of the target to where we want them to be, we are going to continue driving that growth and you can see that in some of the data that we reported this quarter.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great, and then my second question Jay is, I noticed as you said that you took an extraordinary dividend out of the operating companies this quarter. I am curious, why did you take the extraordinary dividend? Does that also mean that you still have your regular dividend capacity available to you this year, to the holding company?", "Jay Benet", "Well this is Jay Benet. We ended up in a very very strong position in our operating companies at the end of the year. Profitability in the fourth quarter was extremely strong and we do an analysis of what the capital levels are and decided that we were just over capitalized based on that profitability. So, rather than leaving it there to take out in the normal quarters, we went to the various fixed regulators and show them what our capital levels were and what we wanted to do, and then just asked if we could take it out sooner than later and we did.", "So it\u2019s just the holding company, so we have the flexibility now going forward, to just execute on our share repurchases and we just think it\u2019s pure management to do that when the operation need to have the excess capital.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "That\u2019s great, and what is your kind of regular dividend capacity available for this year?", "Jay Benet", "We had about $3.5 billion that we could take out without regulatory approval. I should say though that that becomes, without getting overly complex about it, this is a rolling calculation.", "To the extent you get regulatory approval and increase the amount that you take out in a quarter, it will change for the reminder of the year, how much you could take out without regulatory approval, but we are confident that whatever we would like to take out of the operating companies, barring the unforeseen catastrophe or whatever, we will be able to do this year.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi; please proceed.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Hey good morning everybody, how are you? First question, just with respect to the guidance. You\u2019ve maintained your projection for the year despite the incremental $0.50 a share in cats, a slightly higher share account, and even if we net out the benefit of the reserved release, is this guidance or better guidance driven by business trends or is it the jump in non-investment income?", "Jay Benet", "It\u2019s actually kind of more simpler than that, which is that when you look at the results for the first quarter, the $1.25, $1.22 was absolutely consistent with what we had incorporated in our original full year guidance of 520 to 555. So the all in first quarter results were very much consistent with our own number for the first quarter in the annual guidance, and so it\u2019s just a reaffirmation of the same underlying trends.", "Brian MacLean", "As you would expect for a company of our size and sophistication, I mean we are constantly looking at what our plans are for the future and in this particular case as Jay said, we\u2019ve incorporated the actual for the first quarter into our revised local investment income, looking at margins going forward and based on hitting what we had expected to be the operating income or thereabouts in the first quarter. We haven\u2019t seen anything that would change the overall look for the rest of the year.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "And then just regards to the non fixed income part of the portfolio, if you can talk a little bit about the volatility, and I know you try to give maybe a normalized rates of return for that, but what is sort of a long term expected rate of return for that part of the portfolio?", "Bill Heyman", "Hi this, the Bill Heyman. I guess it begs the question what is long term. We make privately fund investment to the expectation that our capital would be out for an average of seven or eight years, and I don\u2019t think we would make those investments if we didn\u2019t think there was a reasonable chance of low double digit returns, although our estimates are more conservative than that, given their current climate.", "With respect to hedge funds, which are now only $500 million in a portfolio of $70 billion, the same hurdle is used, but for estimating purposes we\u2019re in the mid high single digits, but over the long term we would require 12% of these asset classes in any size.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney; please proceed.", "Larry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney", "Thank you. Good morning everyone. First I had just a quick clean up question. The tax charge in the quarter, was that in the interest in other line?", "Jay Benet", "Yes, it was Larry.", "Larry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney", "Okay thanks; and then and reserved development, in the SPI line, it appears in the last two quarters, favorable reserved development has jumped up a bit from where it had been running, and I am wondering if there is anything that you might be able to isolate to explain that.", "Then more generally on reserve development, can you talk about the complexion and the favorable development and whether the balance between reserve releases associated with case or IBNR reserves has changed over the last six quarters or so.", "Jay Benet", "I will take a shot at it. As it relates to the first part of the question, looking at FDII -- now FDII goes through the same processes as the rest of our businesses. Each quarter we are looking at changes in actuarial views associated with very granular levels of our reserves, and whether it\u2019s in international business or whether it\u2019s in the bond in financial products business we\u2019ll take positive of their reserve development or negative reserve development when see or need to do that.", "I don\u2019t think there is anything in particular that\u2019s been driving the reserve development in FDII, but it has been depending upon the quarter partly bond and financial products and partly international. The longer the tail associated with the business the more we wait.", "So I think in the bond and financial products business it\u2019s probably been more of the early 2000 type events that have been reserved for, and we have seen claim activities just doubling out a little lower than what our expectations were.", "As it relates to just the rest of the businesses, I am not sure I can really answer your question as to whether it\u2019s development on case reserves versus rethinking of the IBNR, because as you know, as times go on, there is less and less IBNR and more cases. So we tend to look at it in its totality, but it\u2019s the same phenomena. Whether it\u2019s looked at by an individual business line or particular accident year, what we are seeing is that time has developed and on some of the longer tail lines we are seeing certainly favorable reserve development dealing with less payments of claims than we anticipated.", "Some of the development is the roll forward from older accident years to more current accident years, if in fact the reserve analysis is indicating that the original loss text were higher than what they would seem to be, but that\u2019s not the major driver of it. The major driver is just looking at the claim exiting. I hope that responsive to your question.", "Larry Greenburg - Langen McAlenney", "Yes, that\u2019s helpful thank you.", "Jay Fishman", "Can I interrupt for a second. I want to go back and just actually clarify an answer that we gave previously in response to the question about the expense ratio, just as I have been reflecting on it, and I said \u201cwere the returns in our business generally consistent with our expectations to produce long term mid-teens return on equity\u201d that was the sort of shorthand that I was giving you, and I said \u201cyes, they were, we always have lines of business\u201d", "The returns are not at levels that we want them to be, and we have been consistently public about seeking rate gains where we need them. So I didn\u2019t mean to imply by that answer, that every product that we have met hurdles in every specific way. In a very general sense in responding to the question about the expense ratio overall, we feel pretty good about the overall returns that our portfolio products generate.", "It certainly doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have products where a competitive environment is such that strategically we are seeking rate, so that we can bring those products either into the range of acceptability and there is a number of those that are not further up into the range of acceptability to meet our long term hurdles. I hope that\u2019s clarifying, but it is really a complex question asked in a very simple way.", "We can go back to the questions operator thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Oppenheimer; please proceed.", "Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just a question on the liability business if I could. For recent books, has there been any loss emergence outside your expectation either in 2009 or so far in 2010 and could you talk specifically about the community bank portfolio, thanks.", "Jay Benet", "Sure, in the more recent years, I think the loss experience in generally as a portfolio across all the management liability business are within expectation. So there is nothing there I would say that a trend surprise.", "Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer", "Okay great, and then just a question on the commercial business. So if we get a map on renewal plus new business on the commercial segment, it doesn\u2019t quite match up, is that because that renewal rate is calculating based on policy count, and I guess to follow that, does that mean you are getting more growth at the small end of commercial rather than the large end?", "Jay Fishman", "I am trying to make sure I have got the question straight so when we.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. The statistics you are referencing aren\u2019t based on policy count, they are based on dollars, premium dollars. If I understand the question, what you are trying to do is look at the sum of the business retains, plus your rates. What your missing is what we had disclosed in the fourth quarter in a bar graph that we presented, what\u2019s the impact of exposure, changes, cancellations, endorsements and audit premium, and that\u2019s what gets you to the dollar amount of the premiums in the first quarter.", "So if you were to do that with business insurance, what you\u2019d see is about 82% net retain business, another 19% new business, approximately 1% of rate, all of which would have been a 2% increase in net written premium, and what\u2019s taking place is that a negative 6% but waiting to exposure, cancellations, endorsements and audit premiums that translates into the negative 4% overall.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Great, thank you very much. And just one last question if I could on leverage, how important is operating near that one to one premium to surplus. Is that a target or is that more just a result of other things that you are doing thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s absolutely the result. What I have indicated before is that we have the various rating agency models that we apply along with risk based capital, and whether it\u2019s the car ratio or the S&P or Moody\u2019s model or Fitch models, we evaluate what the operating company capital requirements should be for a strong double A company as we are.", "From that, we then look at the leverage of the holding company the holding company cash to come up with the actual capital position, and the fact that premium to surplus is approximately one to one. It\u2019s not something we look at; it is absolutely the result of that process.", "Jay Benet", "Let me add a comment and Bryan make sure I am right on this, because we tend to lump them together this exposure, audit premium and it\u2019s the function of the way that our arithmetic is done. There are several different dynamics operating there, but the two principle ones are audit premiums which one should think of as retrospective in nature.", "Clients make estimates of what their ratable factors at the inceptions of the policy, at the end of the policy we come in and we do an audit. It turns out that the ratable factors that might be payroll, it might be sales, it might be trucks on the road, but it turned out to be less than they had originally anticipated because of the speedy depth of decline in the economy, and so we have an audit premium return of previously written premium to us. We think of that as almost a retrospective adjustment.", "Then there is imbedded in our renewal business, change in exposure on a renewal basis, which is not always entirely factual, because once again clients make estimates of what their ratable factors will be, and it wouldn\u2019t surprise any of us, if in fact given the economy that there is a tendency at the moment to continue to overestimate if you like, the impact of the economy and so it becomes, and under state the exposure which is something we believe is happening today, but we can\u2019t prove it and we can\u2019t obviously find it in the numbers.", "It will be interesting as the economy levels out and ultimately returns to what our sense is, that the retrospective audit premium dynamic will be the first to change, because in fact the catch up will occur, and then we will begin to see the renewal dynamic of exposure a little slower and a little bit longer, but those are two very different dynamics of the economy that just tend, given our arithmetic to be lump together, and maybe that\u2019s helpful.", "Jay Fishman", "One of the other interesting thoughts here as you look at our data, and probably broadly across much of our business, but certainly in the business insurance side we are growing our customer base it\u2019s hard to see in the premium, because our typical and I am not just talking about writing a whole bunch of small ones so the number are larger.", "We are in the aggregate growing our customer base. The premium is struggling because our typical customer might need a less insurance than they do in normally robust times, and that typically comes through on the AP side, audit premium side. So it\u2019s an important note though that we feel good about this grow.", "Jay Benet", "It\u2019s a bit forward looking and obviously may not happen, but if in fact we come out of this with more customers than we had coming into it, when the economy does recover, we think we will be reasonably well positioned to anticipate a growth in premium, but a lot of factors that happened obviously for the economy to recover has to continue to stabilize first, but at the very basic core of it, we think we are going to be coming out of this with more business insurance customers than we went coming into it.", "Michael Nannizzi - Oppenheimer", "Thanks, very helpful. Thank you so much for the answers.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ninea Mesquite from Credit Swiss; please proceed.", "Ninea Mesquite - Credit Swiss", "Good morning. On the personal audit front you had sequential fiscal quarter-over-quarter. Could you give us a sense for what the competitive dynamic is within the industry and how you are managing to grow the business the now versus the last three quarters?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Ninea, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I think in Bryan\u2019s comments he talked about us being in front of some of the rate cycle in late 2008 into 2009, and you can see that in our RPC statistics. We spend quite a bit of time really looking at filing activity across the country and understanding what the competitors are doing in terms of simple metrics like the ratio increases of filings to decreases.", "We seen an environment where increases are still outpacing decreases, and quite a bit closer to four to one right now. So as we moderate some of our rate; as the market moves with of those, probably to the levels that we were at in 2009, again as I talked about our \u201cenclosed ratios\u201d we can see we are becoming more competitive in the market place and feeling very good about our margins underneath that, and that\u2019s driving some of the sequential growth.", "Jay Benet", "We just said becoming more competitive. It\u2019s easy to come to the conclusions from that statement that we are low in price. What you really mean is that the pricing that we have established is that the market seems to be catching up to it, that\u2019s an important clarification.", "Ninea Mesquite - Credit Swiss", "Sure, fair enough. Margins have also improved this year versus last year. Could you give us a sense of whether this is purely because of late or do you think that there is some elements in the lost constraint, either sequence of severity that\u2019s also helping you.", "Jay Benet", "It\u2019s a combination of both. We have been very disciplined in our pricing in a very segmented level and you can see that in the RPC trends. The lost trend we are watching very closely and some of the mileage driven data and information that\u2019s out there is showing that there has been slight improvement in frequency in the first quarter, and the lost trend is right where our expectations are and we are going to continue with our very focused and disciplined pricing.", "Ninea Mesquite - Credit Swiss", "That\u2019s great, and one last question if I may. On some of the excess surplus lines players have said that the competition among the standard of players is growing. Could you give us a sense how Travelers is ensuring that they are not ridding business that is normally been written by the excess in surplus lines.", "Jay Benet", "Yes, we look we watch very closely, who we are taking business from, where its coming from and are very confident that we are not out there writing any significant number of accounts that belong in the E&S market. The one place that I\u2019ll comment; sometimes some competitors who are in that space will talk about people taking account. Sometimes there are accounts that are in that market place, because the agent, that is the only way in the small commercial side they can access markets.", "So one of the other reasons why business moves out of excess and surplus lines, wholesales businesses into traditional distribution, is the agents hopefully for all appropriate reasons get appointed and come directly to us. But that\u2019s not I think the issue you are talking about, which is there are accounts that belong in that market place because they are complex risks and it shouldn\u2019t be written in standard markets and we are very comfortable but we are not taking that business.", "Jay Fishman", "And from time to time we will have a program, because we talked about these before, where its written both in expense and surplus markets, as well as in admitted markets and standard markets. So we do have an amount of business that we have had for long time, that\u2019s been around here, programs in particular that are also written in the E&S market, but again to Bryan\u2019s answer, there has been no effort on our part to aggressively move business that is historically been in the E&S market and move it over to us.", "Ninea Mesquite - Credit Swiss", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JP Morgan please proceed", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, good morning everybody. I was curious if you can just comment on the reinsurance changes you made internationally, and I guess specifically just clarify whether when you say your changing the retention, the retentions is at a similar level to like the US excessive loss treaty, which I think is 500, or relative to capital. You scaled the attachment point similar to where it is in the US.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, it\u2019s neither actually. This is on a pro risk basis; we have been keeping lower net retentions internationally than we have in the US, so really just confirming that up a little bit, and then we\u2019ve got some individual cap treaties related to our business at much lower levels. We moved those up a little bit, but from 35 to 70, nowhere near the numbers that you are relating from the US.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "And on the per risk, I mean I guess the order magnitude and I guess I am anecdotally -- I mean is that you are moving from the 40 to 50 on your per risk or I guess can you give some color there?", "Jay Fishman", "This is taking net per risk from 10 to 15 in one case, and 10 to 12 in another.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, got you, so nothing huge.", "Jay Fishman", "That\u2019s dollars. That\u2019s $10 million to $15 million per risk or $10 million to $12 millions.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay I guess if you translate in that relative to the gross line that was put on the contract, how does the percentage change? How does that translate into percentage I guess?", "Jay Fishman", "You got to do the math quickly. I mean it varies literally transaction by transaction. If we have a $20 million exposure; instead of having a net pretext 10, we will now have a net pretext 12. If we have a $15 million exposure, instead of having a net pretext 10, we will have a net pretext 12, so it\u2019s specific to the individual loss.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay I just wanted to make sure that you weren\u2019t expanding your gross appetite in concert with this or whether it was truly just a net without the gross line changing. That was the only reason I was asking the question.", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s worth just given how accounting works that this change is disproportionate between gross and net in this quarter.", "Jay Benet", "Yes, in this segment we got a significant portion of the reinsurance that renews, and obviously the premium gets posted in the quarter that it renews, so it\u2019s got a significant impact in the quarter and we\u2019re earning over the year.", "Brian MacLean", "There tends to be a presumption that these things happen ratably, and actually it\u2019s not how it works. The requirement is to actually see the entire amount from the gross at inception, not over the policy period so this impact is written, that\u2019s correct. You are looking at it in an annual effect, all being evidenced in one quarter.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, that makes sense, just wanted to make sure. With respect to the industry focused underwriting segment, are there any particular segments that you would highlight as being disproportionate drivers of the pressure in that segment.", "Brian MacLean", "What do you say pressure?", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Well I guess you have seen it looks like the economy is having a bit bigger impact given the rate trends that don\u2019t look dramatically different from the rest of BI segment. That it just looks like it\u2019s suffering a little bit more. So I was just curious if there was any industry classes or segments that you would highlight as disproportionately driving or if it\u2019s just kind of consistent across everything in that segment.", "Bill Cunningham", "This is Bill Cunningham. The two that comes to mind are constructions and oil and gas. The amount of construction activity on the commercial side is down fairly dramatically, so we are seeing that impact both payroll and revenues for a contractor, and its obviously less drilling on the oil and gas side. So those two classes are certainly disproportionate.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "I appreciate it, thanks", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America/Merrill Lynch; please proceed.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Good morning. Two questions; the first is, if you could talk more about the new business environment, new business is up year-over-year and commercial accounts down. You made some comments; I am wondering if you can flush that out a little but as far as competitive environment for new business.", "Then secondly, one topic we haven\u2019t talked about in a long time is asbestos. I hate to just cross it off my list with something to worry about. I am wondering if you can give us an update on what\u2019s happening there.", "Brian MacLean", "Hi Jay, this is Brian. I\u2019ll tag team a little bit with Phill Cunningham on the new business side. I assume you\u2019re talking specifically the business insurance there.", "A couple of different stories; I think the broad one is, we\u2019ve been doing a ton of things in the market place over the last three plus years, to drive more flow and more opportunities, and a bunch of different funds, we have talked about them in the past. That has continued. We feel great about the amount of business that we are seeing in the marketplace, and all we need to do is go through that in a pretty sophisticated way and find opportunities. So broadly middle market, we feel great about it.", "On the small commercial side, on the small end, the platform that we rolled out in select and our travelers, our express platform there have driven a lot of volume as we would have hoped and we are seeing a lot of opportunity there. The challenge is the GAAP between those and by that I mean what we typically call the higher end of small commercial, where the marketplace is more competitive, and that\u2019s the area where we are taking some pricing actions and seeing lower volumes; pricing actions upward.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Right. On the commercial insurance business, what\u2019s happening to your hit ratios, just to follow up on that.", "Brian MacLean", "The hit ratios are down. I mean the overall comment would be the new business environment remains competitive as Brian mentioned. Our flow of opportunities is up and continues to be up year-over-year, month this year compared to month last year. There has been a consistent increase, each month, each quarter. We\u2019ve worked through more opportunities. Our quote ratio is about consistent, an increase in quotes, so go through the pieces.", "Flow to date just to give you some perspective is up two folds compared to what it was three years ago. So we are seeing that business volume in terms of number of [Inaudible]. We are maintaining about the same quote ratio. So the number of accounts that we are quoting is about double compared to what it was two years ago. The percentage that we are actually getting on order is down.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then any comments in asbestos?", "Brian MacLean", "The environment that we\u2019ve seen in the first quarter has been very much the same environment that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters. There\u2019s literally been no change. I mean we always welcome the day when we could watch a sporting event and not see an advertisement from a plaintiffs attorney talking about asbestos. So that continues in the marketplace, but there really haven\u2019t been any major new developments.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, I\u2019ll put it down on my list then. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "Thank you. He asked my question, but I didn\u2019t know how to get of the queue, but I\u2019ll ask another one. The advertising spend; how do you guys think about the payback in advertising spend and is it meeting your objectives?", "Jay Fishman", "The advertising spend, you can look at it in two separate pieces. There is an element of it that\u2019s pure brand, and the spending that we\u2019ve done in that over the last several years has been long term investment oriented, not action driven.", "The ramp up that we had in advertising has been very specifically behind our direct to consumer business where we are doing a lot more. The short story on our direct to consumer personal initiative is that it is a long term program. We said that we would loose money on the way; we\u2019ve continued to have loosed money on it.", "In terms of driving customers from India to a coding process that\u2019s been actually pretty encouraging. So in the context of the effectiveness of the advertising, if the measure of it is the response that people have to it, that\u2019s actually been pretty good. Then the mix of earnings that we\u2019ve had and we\u2019ve spoken about it -- mix earnings we have to take on in learning how to convert that response into higher numbers of quotes and ultimately into higher number of sales, and in that arena we still have, about consistent with our expectations, we have a long way to go before this becomes a successful business venture.", "Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "Some of your competitors, very few of them say that they have a brand advantage in the commercial line. Do you think that the advertising can help with that for travelers? Do you see any indication from your customers that they are identifying with the brand on the commercial side.", "Jay Fishman", "I think the best way that we can answer that, and of course this is all anecdotal and could be wrong, but if you sit with the group of agents, particularly those in our business insurance arena, they all are aware of the advertising efforts that we\u2019ve undertaken, they are comment on it, and they all say that it makes the job easier.", "Now they could be just talking that, just telling us that and not have it de-substantive, but it is pretty clear to us that the agents do indeed see it, they appreciate it, and at least as they described to us, its helpful to them. I don\u2019t know if is the specific answer with respect to customers.", "If you do watch branch record data and we do but again this is a very long term venture for us and I don\u2019t want to over react to either good news or bad news in that regard. But branch record data would suggest that our advertising is being effective in terms of customer recognition. Now that\u2019s predominantly in the personal side, but again these are all long term efforts to accomplish something overtime.", "Josh Shanker - Deutsche Bank ", "Well, good luck for that and congratulation on the quarter.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ian Gutterman from Adage Capital, please proceed.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Hi, I guess two questions. First one is can you talk a little bit about the decline in non-cat. Well I guess that surprised me. You know [Inaudible] 50 seats at the same time and not on 50 of those states were cat. I would have thought non-cat and cat weather would be up this quarter, but even we both were saying that non-cat was down so is it a categorization thing or last year things were just below the cap threshold and this year they do a lot of events just above or\u2026?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, this is Brian. I think the fundamental dynamic is the last point you are making, which is this quarter -- the little tiny silver lining around the big dark clouds was the events were so bad that they all flipped into the getting categorized as a cat event. So our normal first quarter flow of weather events is always there, because there is always no storms and there is always a little bit of wind and there is always some of that, most of that got lumped into a cat and therefore we\u2019ve got our offsetting benefit.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Got it, okay.", "Jay Fishman", "And that was the primary reason why we try to be very transparent on the fact that there was favorable non-cat weather. We think it\u2019s important that you understand what the underlying dynamics are in the business and be able to look at combined ratios with that in line.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "No, exactly. That\u2019s why I just wanted to make sure that that one we are looking at are ex-cat, but there is a little bit of moving pieces in there so I appreciate that. My other question is on auto. I guess, can you help me get more comfortable that the 95 this quarter is a sort of that you are sustainable back below 96, and the reason I ask it that way is, each of the last couple of years you\u2019ve been that 98, 99 and there has been a quarter in there that\u2019s below 96 then you go right back up.", "To be honest, when I look at your reserve triangles for auto ,you\u2019ve had development in the last couple of years, your paid and our trends frankly look a little weaker than your peers, but on the other hand obviously you\u2019ve got price incoming through. I mean sort of where are we are, are we comfortable below 96 or is it we are hopeful and we need a couple of more quarters to see.", "Brian MacLean", "So a couple of couple pieces Ian, and Greg you can chime in. As I said in my comment we got about a point of good news running through there because of the weather impact on frequency. So the 95 and change is we think from a run rate perspective a little bit understated.", "We have been taking some right actions as we\u2019ve talked about and we are seeing now that that rate is exceeding loss costs, so we are expanding our margins there and we feel good about it. There also is seasonality in how the ratios come through and that\u2019s one of the reasons why they do bounce around a bit. Greg if you want to...", "Greg Toczydlowski", "No just to comment on that seasonality, we typically see in the first quarter a little lower relativity and we certainly talking about the fourth quarter about a much higher relativity. So when you consider all that in the Brian\u2019s comment on the rate offsetting some of the loss trend and Jay\u2019s comment about we have target ranges of return on capital for this line, based on all that we feel like the product is right in the middle of where we want to of those targets that we feel comfortable with it.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Okay. So as may be a fair way to say that it may not be below 96 every quarter but hopefully its 96 for the year end price keeps coming through?", "Brian MacLean", "We certainly price the product on a longer intuitive basis, yes. It\u2019s very difficult to do it at a quarterly level, and the ranges that we look at overall in terms of profit targets for the product line is closer to the 96 to 99 range. So when we consider all of that, we feel like we are right in inside those targets.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "I guess the one thing that surprises me is, even if I take Brian\u2019s comment and it\u2019s just 95 back to 96, I guess and some seasonality. We\u2019re just seeing a big drop from where the four \u201909 year was and I would have though the earned pricing would have come in more gradually unless there are some other benefits you are seeing.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I think we might have started that if you are looking at it on a quarter-to-quarter basis, particularly sequentially you have the fourth quarter which has the higher loss contents associated with it, and then you slip into the first quarter which has by its nature and the seasonality factors the lower loss contents. You have to see it develop over few more quarters I think.", "Jay Benet", "Yes, and its a little bit of pattern stated when you are looking at quarter over quarter of this year. For the 2009 period we did have some adverse activity in the first quarter of 2009 for the fourth quarter of 2008. So when you adjust some of that which we really look at more in and actually here the help of the business, the trend certainly come from.", "Brian MacLean", "I think the bottom line here Ian without giving you a precise number for what we think the full year auto is going to be, we feel better about the auto line. There were some unusual seasonal things going through, but we feel good about the rate we are getting in the lost cost or controls and relative to where we\u2019ve been, we see some real improvement here.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "Great. That\u2019s great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Rob Bobbin from Capital Returns. Please proceed.", "Robin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns", "Hi. I\u2019ve got a question with your large business is and I was wondering how much hard and soft capital supports your large business is and explicitly how much in the way of LLC do you use to make up that those amounts?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. There is a fair amount of LLC supporting the Lloyds business. I think proportionally its probably about 80% LLC are relative to hard capital.", "Robin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns", "And where are the actual dollar numbers?", "Jay Benet", "I am struggling with the number. I think it\u2019s in our tag. $500 million is what I was remember. A little less than that but it\u2019s about $500 million. It will go up and down based upon the instructed writing with Lloyds.", "Robin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns", "What\u2019s the capital approximately, what\u2019s the LLC number?", "Jay Benet", "It\u2019s the LLC number.", "Robin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns", "Okay.", "Jay Benet", "474, $474 millions on page 117 of the cat.", "Robin Bobbin \u2013 Capital Returns", "Approximately, Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Ms. Nawi there are no further questions at this time. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.", "Jay Fishman", "We are all finished. We thank you all for your attention. We hope that this format was more responsive to your need. Let us know if its not. We can do it differently to be helpful to you, and thank you all for your time and attention.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, July 22, 2010.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Frank. Good morning and welcome to the Travelers discussion of our second quarter 2010 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the investor section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note on page one of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the investor section on our website, travelers.com.", "With that, here is Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. Given the very substantial second quarter weather losses for the entire property casualty industry of course for us, we were pleased with our performance this quarter reporting net income of a $1.35 per diluted share, an increase of 6% from last year's quarter and a return on equity of 10.1%. Recognizing that our operating income of $1.39 per diluted share is about $0.11 below consensus estimates, I would like to make the following observations. First, the $0.11 differential equates to approximately $50 million after tax. I point out that for the first six months of the year we have an excess of $1.3 billion.", "Secondly, the shortfall was attributable to second quarter weather losses which aggregated $285 million after tax or $0.58 per diluted share. To put that cost in context, we estimate for catastrophes for the second quarter included in our previously provided guidance was $92 million after taxes or $0.19 per diluted share. As best as we can tell consensus estimates included $0.22 per diluted share for second quarter catastrophe losses. To put the first half weather losses in context, we have already recorded $597 million of after tax catastrophe losses or $1.19 per diluted share. The methods used to estimate our expected annual catastrophe losses indicate an expected annual loss of $390 million after tax or $0.80 per diluted share for the entire 2010 year. So we have been after just six months we are now well in excess of our expected annual loss estimate for the full year.", "Recognizing that we do not control the timing of weather, we just take these events in stride. There have been periods where catastrophe losses have been exceptionally low such as in 2006 and 7 and there were times when they ran abnormally high. We praise our product for the long term and weather will occur when it does. We do not believe this high level of catastrophe loss is in any way a result of changed underwriting standards or reinsurance practices and Brian is going to have more to say about our cap losses later.", "Third, the quarter also benefited from $251 million or $0.51 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. Again as best as we can tell consensus estimate s for the quarter included $0.23 per diluted share of favorable reserve development. And just a reminder because development is so unpredictable we do not include it in any of our guidance. In terms of the operating environment for the second quarter, we remain quite pleased with our performance in our personal insurance segment both auto and home owners.", "Given the amount of discussion at this time last year on our agency auto business, we are particularly pleased with the improving rate of change of policies enforced in personal insurance. Profitability in the first half improved versus last year and we are pleased that the actions taken to improve profitability which we spoke to you about this time last year are coming through in the results.", "In our commercial businesses the operating environment really remained very similar to last quarter. Retention rates remained quite strong and rate on renewal business remained positive but it was at a lower level than in the first quarter. The negative impact of the economy on net written premiums has moderated somewhat from recent quarters and we are hopeful that this bodes well for future economic growth. We repurchased $1.4 billion of our common stock in the quarter and since the second quarter of 2006 we have now repurchased over $12 billion of our common stock. As these actions demonstrate, we continue to execute successfully in the marketplace, generate solid earnings and return excess capital to our shareholders.", "Given that municipal bonds have been receiving a lot of attention lately, we felt we would take a few minutes this morning to have Bill Heyman take the truth strategy and the tactical positioning behind our muni portfolio and demonstrate why we are comfortable with what we own. Our investment team has applied to our municipal portfolio the same very thoughtful approach to risk and reward that served us exceptionally well during the capital market crises over the last several years. I am sure you will find it helpful.", "And with that let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jay. There are a few points based on the data contained on pages 4 through 7 of the webcast that I would like to highlight this quarter. First is our strong balance sheet. All capital leverage and liquidity measures remained at or better than target levels. Second is the repurchase of $1.4 billion of our common shares this quarter and the payment of $173 million in common stock dividends. This brings a total cash we returned to our shareholders to $3.1 billion in the first half of this year.", "Holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion at the end of the quarter down as planned from the $3 billion we held at the beginning of the quarter due to our share repurchase activity and the timing of dividends from our operating companies to our holding company. Another quarter in which we increased both value per share, operating performance, ex-cats [ph] and favorable prior year reserve development but including that investment income that was in line with our expectations.", "Another quarter of net favorable reserve development in each of our segments mostly driven by business insurance where we are announcing better than expected loss results with property, worker's comp and commercial auto product lines and recent accident years and where we have reestimated unallocated loss adjustment expense reserves given recent loss results. And finally a double-digit ROE and operating ROE despite the record second quarter cap losses. I would also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties this quarter, keeping essentially the same structure but at a modestly lower cost. The new treaties are outlined on several pages on the webcast and are described more fully in our second quarter 10-Q which has been filed earlier today. So let us have Brian now discuss our operating performance.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Before I go into the business-specific results, a few comments on this quarter's catastrophe losses. As Jay mentioned, this was the highest level of second quarter catastrophe losses in our history so obviously a different weather quarter and it is on the heels of high first quarter catastrophe loss. In this quarter the activity was not of a national headline variety but it was a very active quarter with numerous significant events.", "Page 8 lists out the 14 industry-designated cats for the second quarter of 2010 with initial property claim services or PCS essence [ph]. Although 14 second quarter events are not unusually high for the industry, the severity of the number of these events is clearly out of pattern. The initial industry estimates of 3.6 is very preliminary and based on reported activity to date. This will obviously develop up and we are confident that once fully developed this will be one of the largest industry catastrophe second quarters. As we look at our level of losses, we are confident that they are not a result of changes in our mixed business, selection process, geographic footprint, or public grant and we do not see anything that would indicate a fundamental change in weather patterns.", "Slide 9 displays our first and second quarter catastrophe loss ratios for the last six years or since our first full year post merger. It shows that for 2010 both quarters were significantly above average level. Within the previous five years with the exception of the second quarter of 2008, catastrophe weather losses were relatively mild. Accordingly, we do not see 2010 as a trend but just another data point which we will factor into our assessment of risk and reward. So we are going to stay in the weather business and we will continue to actively manage our closure.", "Now let me shift to discussing the segment results and I will start with business insurance. When excluding catastrophe unpredictability, underwriting income was very strong driven by continued favorable prior year reserve development. In the current year, loss trend continued to be fairly benign and consistent with our expectations. The renewal rate change on premium for the first half of the year has been slightly positive but is below loss trend and less than expected. So the impact on margins is slightly more than we anticipated.", "Overall, net written premiums were down slightly in the quarter, but not down as much as earlier in the year. The negative impacts of the economy on our insureds, which we see in lower exposures and reduced audit premium continued but have moderated from earlier levels.So, now I will turn to pricing, and if unpredictability has been the message with the weather, stability is the message in our aggregate domestic commercial insurance pricing.", "Slide 11 grasps our renewal premium change and splits out the [inaudible] rate and exposure change components. The short story here is that nothing is really changing. Overall renewal premium change on guaranteed cost business was essentially flat, with a modest improvement in exposure change, offsetting the modest decline in rate change. These overall trends are fairly consistent on an individual business basis, but as always, there are differences, and I would like to highlight a few things.", "Starting with Slide 12, and select accounts. We have been getting some good premium increases and retentions have been consistent, but a few points below where we historically have been. New business has been mixed with strong results in smaller accounts, but in the fourth quarter of 2009 and the first quarter of 2010, lower new business levels in Express Plus.", "In the second quarter, we moderated our pricing strategy and believe this helped boost our Express Plus new business in the quarter. On the renewal book, we typically work 90 days in advance. So, any impact on retention will start in the third quarter. Overall, we continue to feel very good about our Select Express platform and how we are positioned in this market.", "In commercial accounts, retentions have remained very strong and the renewal premium change has improved modestly, going from a slight negative to a slight positive.", "If you look at the commercial accounts chart at the bottom of page 13, you can see that there's essentially flat premium change as a result of improving exposure changes and slightly lower rate changes. When negotiating the renewal, we are negotiating both the pure rate and total premium with the accounts. As the impact of the economy on our customers' exposures has become less negative, it has become increasingly more difficult to negotiate a rate increase, especially when it would result in an overall premium increase.", "New business results for commercial accounts were down compared to the prior year quarter. In the second quarter of last year, our new business writings benefited from the marketplace disruption caused by the financial distress of several of our competitors. Absent this impact, the results reflect a normal seasonality of our business. Our new business flow has stabilized at record levels, with quote rates slightly and close rates down slightly. Given these dynamics, we continue to be very pleased with our new business performance.", "In other business insurance, retentions have remained very strong or price change for both the rate and exposure have moved more significantly than the overall commercial business. These pricing impacts are primarily driven by our large property business, with some significant softening in rates but improvement in exposure. As competitive pressures in this class of business increased in the coming quarter driven by ample reinsurance capacity and a benign 2009 hurricane season, we made a conscious decision to maximize our retention on this business and not push rates on large property accounts. Similarly large property new business became increasingly more competitive with aggressive concessions to expiring terms and conditions frequently required to motivate accounts to leave their current carrier and we are not willing to make these concessions.", "In summary, we continue to prudently manage each of our businesses and adjust our actions to the unique needs. But in the aggregate, the results are not different than our recent experience, that is, solid retentions, relatively stable pricing, and a strong flow of new business opportunities.", "In the financial, professional, and international insurance segment, the core underwriting margins were generally stable in the quarter as the marginal rate gains essentially offset slightly increasing loss trends. Additionally, the underwriting margins benefited from a reduction in surety reinsurance cost associated with prior year reinsurance [trading].", "Net written premiums, after adjusting for the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates were down for the quarter. In some of our management liability lines of business and in some of our international lines, we believe pricing is not consistent with our profitability targets, so our writings in those lines are down.", "Turning to production statistics on page 16, although renewal premium change is slightly negative in both management liability and international, for most of the businesses contained here, we have achieved positive rate gains.", "Turning to personal insurance. In agency, auto, our underwriting margin, after adjusting for the impact of tax, and prior year developments, improved quarter-over-quarter, as rate gains once again outpaced loss cost trends. Within agency, property, we have been speaking to you for sometime regarding the slight margin compression, driven by year-over-year increases in the cost of materials, primarily asphalt shingles. As the rate gains we achieved in recent quarters continue to earn through our property business, we have crossed an inflection point, where in the second quarter our rate improvement outpaced loss cost trends.", "Agency, auto new business improved in the second quarter as we reintroduced our 12-month policy. As we have become more confident in our new business products and are consistently within target returns, we felt it was appropriate to reintroduce a longer term policy. The aggregate timing impact of this additional six months of written premium was about $30 million in the quarter. As the rollout of this product is completed, the impact on our new business written premiums will increase throughout 2010. More significantly, we are pleased with the improving rate of change in policies in force. We believe the PIF change is a result of our improved competitive position compared to third and fourth quarter of 2009.", "Agency, property production results for the quarter continued to be strong in spite of the difficult housing market. Quarter-over-quarter PIF growth was at the highest level since third quarter of 2007. Retention improved two points, and new business is up 15% compared to the same quarter last year.", "Given the expansion in core underwriting margins and the strong topline trends in these products, we are very pleased with both our current and going forward marketplace position in personal insurance.", "So, let me sum it up. Weather has been bad. But it's a big part of our business, and the one thing we know for sure is that it will change. The commercial marketplace, both domestic and international is fairly stable. We obviously wish it was improving, but we feel great about our position and are confident we will maximize the opportunity. And in personal insurance, we are encouraged by the trends both for us and the industry.", "With that, let me now turn it over to Bill Heyman to discuss our tax-exempt portfolio.", "Bill Heyman", "Thanks Brian. Since municipal securities have received considerable attention in the press, I thought I would spend a few minutes discussing the sector in general and our portfolio in particular. As you know, we have a tax-exempt portfolio of about $41 billion. You may not know that of that about $7 billion consists of bonds which have been pre-refunded, which means they have been [inaudible] maturity or their first call date usually with US treasury securities. Still the $34 billion remaining constitutes about half of our fixed income portfolio.", "The first observation I make is that we have fortunately always starting long before credit cards became an issue, viewed taxes and credits as credits first, without regard to any advantages or taxes [inaudible]. While optimization of the alternative minimum tax provides a target allocation, it's not a bucket we feel we must fill regardless of quality. And a general obligation of the school district competes with the corporate bond or mortgage-backed security for investing dollars. We scrutinized closely not only the creditworthiness of the issuer but the nature of the obligation. For example, in some cases, revenue bonds could be stronger than [GOs] and vice versa. Furthermore, where issuers have enhanced their creditworthiness with bond insurance, we've always ignored it. The result was that several years ago, when the bond insurers more or less simultaneously lost their AAA ratings, we did not make portfolio changes.", "The result of high credit underwriting standards means that our portfolio does not closely resemble the broad market. For example, we own about 23 million of municipal healthcare revenue bonds, or about one-tenth of 1% of our portfolio. Such bonds represent roughly 7% of the broad market and since 1970, 39% of all municipal defaults have been in the healthcare sector. Conversely, we are overweighted in pre-refunded bonds, states and local general obligation bonds and water and sewer bonds. Recent focus on general obligation bonds relates to the potential for these bonds to be treated like senior unsecured debt with bondholders becoming general creditors alongside employees, retirees and vendors.", "The general credit [at construct] is most descriptive of general obligation bond issued by states and general funds act like pools collecting revenues from a wide range of taxes and paying salaries, making pension contributions, paying vendors, as well as servicing their general obligation debt.", "In contrast, this construct is probably not descriptive of many local general obligation bonds. We expect that in its premises where there is a many local GOs would be treated as secured creditors based upon legal presidents and the provisions of Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code which provides that the security interest in special revenues remains valid and enforceable in bankruptcies.", "As you know most school district general obligation bonds are specifically authorized by voters and validate issuance [ph]. This authorization allows the pledge of ad valorem taxes to be levied on all taxable property within the school districts without limitation as to greater amount. The collection of these taxes is generally segregated in the debt service fund outside of the general fund and these funds can only be used to service the authorized debt and are not available that can ask the general purposes of this school.", "The unlimited in nature and segregation of this debt service, tax revenue contrast sharply with the school districts other property tax revenues which are statutorily limited and commingled with its state peoples funding and used for operations. In addition to assembling the portfolio selectively, we manage it actively. The portfolio contains approximately 8000 discrete securities but have only 925 issuers. They're over 50,000 issuers in the municipal markets.", "We have general obligation bonds of (inaudible) 75 cities, there are over 5300 in the Bloomberg database. So we feel we know our cities well. We monitor closely financial position and operations of our credits, while it is true that we are basically buying to hold investors. We have in the past year reduced often substantially, positions and issuers with credit worthiness as in our view deteriorated. So I would add we believe it even those issues we sold are overwhelmingly likely to pay every dollar on time.", "As we demonstrated two years ago with our mortgage portfolio, we do not blindly rely on ratings, but it is nonetheless worth noting that roughly 50% of our municipal portfolio holdings which are not funding having an average AAA rating from Moody's S&P and Fitch, compared to only 17% of the broad market. Almost 96% are rated AA3 or higher, only 4%, 4.3% are rated A or lower compared to 33% in the index.", "Rating agencies are looking at the same challenging economic budget and spending dynamics affecting state and local governments that all of us are, yet the ratings of our holdings remain very strong. A recent publication my Moody's points out that over the entire period 1970 to 2009, the riskiest 20% of municipal issuers measured by ratings accounted for 86% of all defaulters. Our portfolio contains approximately $7.2 billion in state general obligations with only about $330 million in the headwind [ph] states of California, Illinois and New York.", "The table in the webcast contains the aggregate holdings and the average ratings of our top 16 states. With the exception of our holdings from California which averages AA2, the average rating for each state is AA1 or higher. The general obligation bonds of the top five states totaled $1.4 billion. All that said we have purchased very few big state GOs in recent years and have sold a few recently.", "The other slide in the webcast presents the runoff of our state GOs based on current market yields for those borrowers and the coupons structure of our holdings nearly 70% of our state GOs will mature or will be called by 2015. For local general obligation bonds from the top five states totaled $6.4 billion and the revenue bonds from these states totaled $3.6 billion.", "Our general obligation bonds and issuers other than states consists towards school district exposures with the moderate number of counties, cities, community college districts and other special districts. As we just discussed the nature of these obligations is such that most could be considered as obligations sent through by a pledge or revenue from ad valorem property taxes levied without limitation to greater amount.", "As we have discussed previously a fixed income portfolio exist first and foremost to ensure our commitment to our policy holders. We underwrite the invested risks assumed in our portfolios with careful consideration of the tradeoff between risk and returns. Just as in the other fixed income assets, we do not reach for yield in our municipal portfolio in attempt to outperform our benchmark, lose investment manager's compensation or for any other reason. We expect our fixed income assets, including our municipal portfolio, to provide adequate risk adjusted returns and support our insurance operations in pursuit of maximizing wealth for shareholders over the long term. Obviously, history may not be indicative of the future and ratings cannot be relied upon with certainty, but we believe our portfolio is strong and we wouldn't trade it for anyone else's. We can certainly have losses in our municipal portfolio, and even material losses, but even due to the prism of recent events, we feel very comfortable with what we own.", "Let me turn it over now to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Bill. Well, let's discuss updated guidance for the full year. We've got information on Page 22 of full year 2010 fully diluted operating income per share, which has now been refined from the previous range of $5.20 to $5.55 to a new range of $5.20 to $5.45, which is a $.10 reduction of the upper-end of the range that primarily resulted from commercial-renewal premium increases in 2010, not meeting our original expectations which we believe is attributable to the impact of the continuing difficult economic environment. In round numbers, this range for operating income should still translate into an operating return on equity of approximately 11% as we've said before.", "We continue to anticipate some accident near-loss ratio deterioration on a consolidated basis for full year 2010, ex cuts, as we expect loss-cost increases to modestly outpace projected earned-rate increases in our commercial businesses for the full year. So in your modeling, please remember that the second half of last year included favorable re-estimations of current year-loss ratios for first half 2009 losses, so quarterly loss ratio comparisons for 2010 versus 2009, must take this into consideration.", "We're now assuming cut losses of $835 million after tax or $1.71 per diluted share, which incorporates our actual cut losses to the first half and our original estimates for the second half of the year, no further estimates of prior year reserve development, either favorable or unfavorable, below single-digit decrease in average investment assets ex unrealized gains and losses, resulting from a reduction of holding company liquidity due to the share repurchases of full-year share repurchases of $4 billion, and a weighted average diluted share count after share repurchases in employee equity awards of approximately 487 million shares.", "So with that, why don't we open it up for Q&A?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks. My first question is on the pace of the share buybacks. Choblers repurchase a $3 billion of stock in the first half of this year, I believe the guidance is for $4 billion for the first year, you have the still almost $4 billion left in the existing authorization. I was just trying to get a sense of why the pace may slow or might that just be a conservative outlook. And my second question has to do with the economy. It appears that we're lacking some of the more challenging comparisons, so I'm trying to get a sense of how much of a benefit the stabilizing economy could be and whether Travelers feels the consumer raised prices as exposures increase? Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "Jay, thank you. First on the share buyback, we have historically scaled back in the third quarter, a pending, obviously, catcheese and of course it seems to us like we've already endured two quarters of that season already. My recollection was that the original estimates of share buyback included in the guidance was $3 billion, $4 billion and \u2013 $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And essentially we are still largely on that target for the moment. We may alter that as we go into the quarter, depending upon second half of the year that is, depending upon earnings, depending upon whether our reserve development can extend to the course and all that. But nonetheless, it's a plan that we embraced beginning of the year and for the moment we're sticking to it.", "Your second question and maybe Brian and I will ham and egg this a little bit. We certainly can't approve this to you, it's largely anecdotal. It's from sitting with conversations with our field folks and I'm speaking now about your question regarding the commercial insurance environment.", "Our census is that there isn't anything that has particularly changed competitively. You all seem to be fixated all the time, have some company or companies change their pricing strategy or tactics, we certainly don't see that and have no evidence of it.", "What we are hearing from our field folks is that as exposure is leveling out and it was \u2013 a comment I made earlier was that it looks as though exposure is trying to get back to zero broadly speaking in the commercial lines businesses is that it's getting more challenging to get rate increases.", "If you're a customer you really don't focus on the granular dynamics that make up your price, your premium. You're really not all that worried about how much is exposure and how much is rate change and all that nonsense, what you as a customer tend to look at is, is my premium going up or down in its simplest form and as exposure flattens out to the extent that you try and get rate gains you're asking for a premium increase in this economic environment or census is that it's getting just more challenging to pass that rate increase on.", "There is more or little more resistance both from the intermediaries, the agents and brokers as well as the customers to accepting meaningful rate increases. Now it's interesting, we didn't present the data but we certainly do look at the distribution of rate gains in our middle market business each and every quarter. We've shared that with you previously and to the extent they are lost dynamics at work to the extent that an account has loss experience, that's different more problematic than what it had originally been expected. We do get rate gains. There are still significant accounts where we'll see a plus five or even a plus 10 rate gain but it largely is loss driven. It's not in effect margin or profitability driven.", "So, I'd love to hear if Brian has any comment but our census is that the margin picture broadly in our commercial businesses is modestly deteriorating, that it's and that is that our ability to get rate in the aggregate is a little bit less than what you're experiencing broadly speaking in loss trends.", "So that's the way that we would I think I'd answer.", "Brian MacLean", "I mean one of the phrases that I'd emphasize that Jay just used is this economic environment. So we certainly wouldn't want to make the statement that as long as exposures are coming up we can never get rate changes. If you think of where the psyche of our typical commercial customer is today they saw the economy take a big dip, they saw their business by and large take a big dip.", "The good news is, if we look at our total portfolio they're kind of back to not dipping anymore. They're not yet back to growing or anything close to robustly growing and in that mindset they saying they're going \u2013 again, loss experience being neutral we're going to struggle with premium increases. So that's the dynamic we're seeing today.", "Jay Benet", "In the context of returns in our business you always got to go back to where are we from a profit margin perspective. When we went back, you go back to the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year, which obviously contemplated normal tax and no reserve development, the return on equity that we were projecting for the year was about 11% and in the context of the environment we're in, both the investment environment and important to remember the investment environment combined with the economic environment, that's a pretty good return.", "It's difficult for us to plead that profitability measures in our business are inadequate and as a consequence we need to improve margins in this investment and economic environment to the extent that we're capable of producing an 11% return on equity we feel pretty good.", "So, we continue to try and keep rate where most importantly where the loss experience demonstrates that we should and to the extent that we can improve our profitability dynamic as we move forward we'll continue to do that but it's not as if we're starting from a point of impaired profitability in any way, it's a pretty strong franchise and a pretty strong profit picture in the context of that environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matt Heimermann from JP Morgan.", "Matthew Heimermann \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi good morning everybody. A couple of questions for Bill. One, I was just curious if you could comment on the performance of the other investment income line this quarter and what drove that, just a little surprising given what macro is happening in the investment environment.", "Then second, just with respect to the municipal portfolio I guess if someone wanted to play devil's advocate, a lot of the defenses of the municipal securities market around rating, average credit quality, things like that or things that were made for the mortgage market. So I guess if you had to be realistically bearish on your portfolio or the market probably what would you point to as kind of the bigger risk?", "Bill Heyman", "Okay let's take them in order. In terms of the other assets, the results of the quarter where it could be the more [ph] to strong distributions in private equity, cash flow from the portfolio for the first six months was about even that means distribution equal capital contributions, which is better than we would have expected and there was a lot of net investment income gain in the results that we saw.", "Hedge funds made money but not very much, made a couple of points better than the broad index. Our hedge fund portfolio was only about 470 million, it was 1.6 billion at the time of our merger. And frankly we find it difficult to put an ex-ante facto, which managers will do well and which won't. So we have handful of relationships of longstanding.", "In real estate, a lot of our funds had marked down properties probably excessively and the first half of the year reflected a balance in evaluations excluding municipals. I agree with you, one can argue both sides of the equation forcefully.", "We think about this issue everyday but I would add we're not talking our book because we can't get out of where we are. If we decided that instead of 34 billion, forget the (inaudible) for the moment instead of 34 billion it ought to be 20 billion or 25 billion. The quality of our holdings would permit us to make that adjustment and the market is very firm, frankly it's firm, it's very firm even in credits we wouldn't buy.", "In terms of the risks in the sector and I think I alluded to this at investor day in May. I think the risks are less of economic default but even with states with big budget problems are when you analyze them is not very heavily taxed.", "The risks are that some jurisdictions will seek, if a court allows them, it may not to, repudiate their debt simply because they choose not to increase taxes or cut budgets.", "I think with respect to larger jurisdictions the possibility of it is pretty remote. It is one thing to only have access to the capital market at a higher price and frankly most jurisdictions haven't even faced that penalty yet. It is another to lose access to the capital market altogether, which is what would happen in a political repudiation.", "So I agree, the issue is not free from doubt and our take on it can be disputed but it's not (inaudible).", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Keith Walsh from Citi Group.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Good morning everybody. A couple of questions here, just to follow up on the exposures, trend looks better. How do we reconcile that with sort of the negative data that we've been seeing coming out of small businesses whether it's lending, business optimism, new business startups. And then if you could also touch on the trends you're seeing within auto premiums and then I've got a follow-up for Bill, thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "I'll take the first and I'll ask Greg to take on the second. First I think our exposure data is actually largely in sync with what we see as to GDP changes broadly. We're not seeing growth, what we're actually seeing is a leveling out and I think that there are some measures that would suggest that the economy is actually expanding modestly. There are some that would suggest that \u2013 there are some that would suggest that that it has flattened. And that's largely at this point what our aggregate data say.", "There will be some pluses and some minus in various businesses. But the exposure change that we saw in the second quarter across all of our commercial businesses in the aggregate was getting close to zero. And I think if you asked anyone from an economic perspective what do they see, they would largely say that at the very least we flattened out. So we don't see it as in consistent, maybe there is something else that you see, but that's kind of our take on.", "Brian MacLean", "Keith, on the second piece, did you ask about auto or audit?", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Audit premiums.", "Brian MacLean", "Okay, and this is Brian. On the audit premium side, we've talked about the numbers before at the depth of \u2013 in the normal environment, we're going to see something like three to five points of positive on the audit premium side.", "Around the end of last year, very beginning of this year, we were running about a point negative and we are close to back to zero. So we're at a \u2013 at a really modest negative number. So pretty consistent with that that same view on the exposure change numbers. So still negative, but close to back to a plus number. Now, again in normal world, we'd look for a plus three to five so.", "Jay Fishman", "And that's less about \u2013 (inaudible) speak to that point about being it less about the economies and the way our policies work.", "Brian MacLean", "Well, yes, there's obviously that audit premium has a lot to do with the psychology of the buyer and how the product is even sold. And the natural course is that the buyer is going to understate exposure slightly and we pick it up on the backend on the exposure and so we're always playing that game. So that leads to the normal three to five.", "Jay Fishman", "And so that one makes snapback \u2013", "Brian MacLean", "Quite.", "Jay Fishman", "Somewhat unpredictable because we're doing with a psychology of our buyers and their willingness in effect you have a carry for a period of time, premium relative to expose your change, we of course factor that into our pricing, it's not a surprise to us. But that one may snapback faster because it is predominantly psychologically driven more than the overall genuine exposure which really is an economic dynamic.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "That's very helpful. And then, Bill, you started to touch on the some munis, but what I really want to know is who holds the senior position here, is it the bond holders or is muni workers, pension payments and healthcare benefits, where is that dollar going to go to if that has to, if we come down to that?", "Bill Heyman", "Well, we think in issuers below the state level bond holders. At the state level, less clear.", "Keith Walsh \u2013 Citi", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Oppenheimer. Please proceed.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Thank you. Just had a question about the FPII segment and to reserve development there, can you talk about that development relative to your management liability business in particular, the depository institutions? And I have one follow-up, thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "Sure. And, I guess, I'd direct you back to the conversations we've had previously about the credit crunch analysis and I'd say that probably the way that we're at it is it's stable. So hasn't been a lot of change.", "The release probably comes from six or eight years from '01 to '08 and the actuaries go through the data every quarter and they are making lots of estimates and judgments based on a lot of \u2013 a lot of cases that are still really at a state of infancy. So I would think, broadly speaking, no change.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay. And then, I know, that disclosure last year, you had mentioned 26 institutions that had been closed, do you \u2013 can you update a little on the exposure there and any changes or any new institutions?", "Jay Fishman", "You mean clinically on the institutions that have been taken over?", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes. So far this year, I think we've got probably close to a 100 institutions that are being taken over about 96. We've got 33 of both.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "You \u2013 first you said we got.", "Jay Fishman", "There's been 96 institutions the FDIC has taken over. We're on about 33 of those, our average expose limits to those are about $4.5 million. So broadly speaking, it's developed since last year as we would have expected it to.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Great, thank you. And then, just if I could one follow-up on personal lines, the \u2013 Brian you had mentioned on that slide at $3.6 billion I think in CAT expectations for the second quarter and Travelers' number in the second quarter is about $440 million. Am I looking at that in the midst about 10%? I just want to understand is it just different estimate base or how should we think about that? Thanks.", "Brian MacLean", "The $3.6 billion on the industry slide is \u2013 comes out of PCS, property claimed services, and that is purely the kind of initial data that they've gotten from carriers. And in some cases, for some events that happened literally three or four weeks ago, so very, very immature data. That will develop up fairly dramatically.", "Jay Fishman", "History would suggest.", "Brian MacLean", "History would suggest, yes. And just the way the claim process works.", "Jay Fishman", "I'd make a very important point. We don't utilize PCSF in the mix to make our estimates of losses from those events. Our losses are based upon what you're accruing are based upon claim notices, claims filed, and our people on the ground. So it's \u2013 the important point here is that while we believe that history again suggest the PCF data will develop negatively, historically, our estimates have actually been pretty good relative to catastrophe points.", "Brian MacLean", "Because, obviously, what we're trying to do is, is as quickly as possible, take our claims data and make any actuarial estimate of what the ultimate will be. And PCF does that overtime, but it takes them longer. So it's really tough to do any kind of industry relativity right now. And then, obviously, you've got geographic distribution underneath that that you got to look at. But, so we will scrutinize that as the data becomes available. But, you know, all we know is it's a big industry event and it was a big quarter for us.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Oppenheimer", "Okay, thank you for answering all my questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. I guess, first maybe, big picture on the reserve development. I guess if you've looked at your accuracy, you almost think you guys aren't that good of setting reserves, given how redundant things have been. If you can talk more specifically about what's happening.", "I know it's going to vary by line and by segment, but is it more of a frequency issue or a severity issue, that's the first question. And then, secondly, maybe for Bill on the other investments. It looks like the return this quarter annualizes around 12%. And I've probably asked this before, but what would you consider the normalized return on those investments?", "Jay Fishman", "Jay, Brian's going to answer your question on the reserve development. But, I'll just make an observation that we really try hard to get it right, because the issue is actually how we priced our product to the extent that we end up overstating our loss costs going into a product offering than we're pricing it higher that we otherwise would have to and we become less competitive relative to someone who takes a different view. So it always feels good when it happens.", "Of course, it feels terrific when your results are impacted this way and certainly it's a whole lot better than underestimating the loss cost, which means, you're under pricing your product and that's really a disaster. But we really try hard to get it right, because in the end, what we're about is trying to grow a business and getting it right is what's going to help us do that the best. Now your points are relevant, we've had a long stretch year of significant development and Brian or Jay or \u2013", "Brian MacLean", "I can (inaudible). When you look at the components that makeup the reserve development, frequency continues to be behaving in a way that when you go through the reserve setting process, you come up with as soon as what frequency is going to be and it's behaving better than that. And that's been a trend that's been going on for a while.", "When actuaries and finance people are looking at what the reserve process should be as it relates to favorable frequency and work with their business partners in terms of pricing and everything. If you look at what the current trends are, you wonder are things are going to get better than they are when you're at a favorable position.", "And sometimes you just look at it and say, \u201cWell, they're pretty good. And I can't imagine them getting better and sometimes they do.\u201d So that's been a part of it. We're in a very low inflationary environment today. And looking out several years as to what severity is going to be, it's just a little bit of a change in the inflationary outlook is going to have an impact as well. So you have to go back to what's the some base upon which all of this is being done and on a gross basis, our reserves are in excess of $50 billion. So that's absolute level of these changes in terms of percentage point are very, very low. But given the nature of that reserve base, they impact the income statement as you've seen but as Jay said, each one of these quarters, we're doing best estimates of what we see out there using all the information and there's the changes. We just update the reserves.", "Brian MacLean", "And Jay, this is Brian, so two other points. Because if you look at where the development has come from not just in this quarter but over a good period of time, I'd say two things. First on the liability side where we had a lot of favorable reserve development, one of the toughest things to estimate that over time is where that sort of environment fell in and what the sustainable impact of that is. And so, that's been a big variable driving our improvement and at the same time, over and again, this is a five to six-year kind of statement.", "We've done a lot in our liability claim process that we think has helped the way we do business and service our customers and we think that's had a pretty strong impact there. But it takes time to see the impact of those things coming through the lost data and so that's been driving it. And then the other area is workers' comp which has continued, again, I always say this with comp \u2013 very much a state-by-state gain. But in the aggregate where we play, we continued to see some favorable moves there and frequency dynamics that Jay Benet talked about but comp would be an area where that's really been true \u2013 just trying to look at those frequency trends and project forward what do we think they're going to be in the future.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's great and the other investment return?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I think that one has to speak the various sectors rather than generalize for other investments. I think from owned real estate unleveraged, one article it makes, need the high single-digits leveraged real estate that has funds, low double-digit hedge funds, low double-digit private equity \u2013 maybe a little more. And therefore, our blended return depends on our allocation of those asset classes.", "Obviously one has to rethink all those returns. If we are in a protracted period at very low interest rates, we may all \u2013 all of us is going to be stuck in the mindset in what these assets are going to make in the world before 2008. But those are of course fact numbers.;", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So based on what you just said, the returns in this quarter weren't terribly overstated at all?", "Brian MacLean", "They are generalizing as a blend of number there. What we would hope to make over a statistically significant time period which unfortunately is more than a quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant from KBW. Please proceed.", "Cliff Gallant \u2013 KBW", "Good morning. Billing, actually off of on that is Jay's question a little bit in terms of loss cost trends, I'm just wondering about to what degree are you seeing favorable loss cost trends whether it be from deflation or even falling frequency? And to the extent that you are, how confident would you be to really act upon that in terms of your forward pricing? You know, I think of the personal auto industry 10 years ago where, in other words, we were about to experience several years of abrupt defalling frequency and I think some of the more aggressive companies like Progressive had wished that they had been able to fully anticipate that to really grow their book. And I'm curious how you would take that in terms of going forward?", "Jay Benet", "Well, first, I'd observe that this is very much line-by-line specific. There are long-tail lines where you take a deep breath obviously before you embrace an emerging trend. And I'm going to make an example, in workers' comp, we are still contemplating meaningful medical inflation. We're not pricing our product. We talk all the time that benign lost cost and inflation, you should always be excluding medical work in medical portion of workers comp. But we assume a robust inflation rate and we'll obviously see how that works out.", "Generally speaking, I think a couple of individual exceptions Brian talked about, asphalt shingles which a number of carriers have highlighted because it's a by-product price of oil. That loss cost trends severity have, broadly speaking, been awfully benign. That doesn't mean zero. It doesn't mean that we don't see some embedded inflation in lines of business. And we, as the shorter the tail of that business is, the more we're willing to embrace it and incorporate it into our pricing because if we're long, it doesn't take long before we can reprice the product. The same thing holds true for frequency.", "In many lines of business, there has been a long-term systemic decline in frequency and I would actually say that it's gotten \u2013 well we've been chasing it. You ask the question all the time as frequency comes down, is it making a new level or is it going to return back to previous levels, not only in from a pricing perspective but also from the reserving perspective as well. I think the same thing holds true to the extent that these are shorter-tail lines of business. We're pretty aggressive in embracing and to the extent that they are longer-tail, we're a little more reluctant to move in that direction.", "I think one of the things that's affected workers' compensation, I can't prove. It's just the data that we look at is that as our economy has moved increasingly to a service-based environment, frequency and workers' comp has come down. They've done another great surprise to people. And so that sort of a dynamic, that element, if you feel more comfortable embracing so it's very line specific. And I think it's difficult to generalize if there's a line that you're particularly interested in, you can attempt to answer.", "Brian MacLean", "I mean, Cliff, you're really getting to the core of the puzzle we're trying to solve each and everyday in the marketplace. Do we understand why lost trends are changing? First of all, can we see it granular as possible where they're changing and breaking out. And then, the real trick is understanding lie. The generality would be the better we feel about our ability to understand why something is changing, the more confident we're going to be factoring into our pricing. Where you get in trouble as you see a pattern and you don't understand why, you need to start extending the patterns. Well, we could talk \u2013 it is as Jay said, it's very much a line-by-line\u2026", "Jay Benet", "And I do think though culturally, as a matter of the institutions and the way actually I was thinking and in this organization, you would characterize us as not pushing the edge. If there's, and again, particularly in longer-tail lines, you take a great risk when you make an assumption unless the changing trends embrace it, price your product, reserve for it, and find longer holiday yields, not only underpriced but under reserved boat. So I just think culturally here, we're not an organization that instinctively pushes the edge.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "A couple of quick questions here. First, looking at the business insurance action, your combined ratios, extra cash underlying, shifting from loss ratio aside, it looks like when you adjust for the current period development last year, it's up about 200 basis points year-over-year. Is that pretty consistent with who we should expect your going forward, given you comments about continued acts and the perpetration over the year?", "Brian MacLean", "Brian, I'm trying to do the math in my head.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "I think what you said was about 62 last year in the second quarter. That's the current period.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I would say pretty close to that.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I mean, the thing that we'd urge you to do or to everyone to do is look at last year's combined ratio, look at last year's loss ratio, a component in its totality for the year because of the re-estimation that took place in the third and fourth quarter. So the best proxy for what the loss ratio was for coming into 2010 would be the full year 2009 loss ratio. And then we said, we would expect some margin compression from that and so far, what you've seen is the first six months.", "That would be the mechanical comparison that you would want to do, recognizing that in any period, non-capital-related weather is also going about to round and there's going to be some noise from other large loss activity or whatever. But that would be the base information to be taken a look at.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "And then also, the business insurance, your G&A expenses, even if you add back the benefit you had the second quarter last year down, feel its extensively year-over-year, anything unusual going on there or is there some expense initiatives going on?", "Jay Benet", "Well, we're always closely managing expenses and there is the timing of some expenses that will take place with various quarters, one year versus the next. So I wouldn't say there's anything in particular going on there, other than we're always watchful of our expenses.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Right. And then the last question, you talked about pricing and how you want to adjust it for \u2013 obviously what's going on with lost causes, et cetera, but what about interest rates right now? I mean, it seems like interest rates are going to be low here for a while longer. How can you adjust pricing for interest rates or can you in the current marketplace?", "Jay Benet", "Bill and I spend a lot of time talking about the environment, and it's very possible now that what we're in an extended period of time at where we are. And as a consequence, we are beginning to think meaningfully about what the implication of that is for our business. And that not only gets to pricing of our product but return expectations, capital embedded in our business, ways in which the capital is used. It's a broad question that gets well beyond, are you pricing adequately? Again, in this environment, these interest rates were able to generate round numbers and 11% return on equity. Now you begin to ask yourself the question, if riskless rates are where they are and spreads are where they are, then what are reasonable returns and what can be expected and how to we deploy our capital (inaudible) in a different environment. Whereas the \u2013 I would say the early stages of those discussions, that they are serious discussions that would you take your place irregularly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Good morning, and thank you for taking the call. First question, I think accurately heard that you are issuing annual policies for your personal (inaudible). And if that's the case, I'm a little bit curious in this strategy. Historically, I think if that is a sort of a top-of-the-market kind of strategy to hold on to your business as opposed to a bottom-of-the-market strategy. Given on the upside, you would typically want to be able to re-price your product as far as you can. Am I just wrong on that or is there a different subtlety here to that strategy that I'm missing?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Hey Paul, this is Greg Toczydlowski. I guess the answer to that question, you got to kind of start of it off where we began and we started driving a sophisticated product out in the marketplace about five years ago. And underneath that was our first (inaudible) in the predictable modeling. So as we needed to stay nimble and adjust that product, we kept the shorter-term contracts as we moved forward and become very confident in that new business pricing. And that, in combination with the demand base from our agents and customers based on the profile that we're trying to attract, we think it was prudent to issue the annual policy at this point in time. And again, as Jay talked about, some of the underlying dynamics of the personal insurance business, we feel terrific about acquisition right now.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "My second question is back to the current returns. And I agree that 11% ROE, and especially relative to your peers, is a good result. The question I have is , is that does this in your mind suggest that essentially the market \u2013 the market largely ignores the interest rates where they are today and their profitability? And or is this in your view, a view that is essentially the hurdle rate has fallen for the industry because I would imagine that the hurdle if anything has gone up given volatility, uncertainty, the CAT losses. And the stock market seems to be behaving \u2013 the stock market looks like its behaving, the hurdle rate for the industry has risen over the cycle?", "Jay Fishman", "I understand the question, I think, anyway. I, at first, I certainly don't think that the insurance industry ignores investment returns as we price our products, we are driven by available investment returns in the marketplace. When \u2013 shortly after the crisis, when the world sort of settled back down and we were confronted with a different kind of fixed income environment than had existed , the real question was will you go into knee jerk react to a changing interest rate environment, causing disruption to agents, brokers, customers and all of your distribution. Who are you going to take a deep breath and see what would happen to investment returns over time.", "I've spoken about this earlier, it was our decision to take this in the longer view and not to knee jerk. Now 18 months ago and attempt to drive pricing up in some very dramatic fashion, I think that would have been not only highly disruptive, but candidly not very successful. That would be a strategy that I think would have failed. Now I think, and again, this is how we perceive it, you can certainly ask other companies what their view is. It may very well be that this economic malaise, such as it is, is longer rather than shorter and it may very well that this investment environment is a consequence, longer rather than shorter. And we are in, as I said the early stages of really thinking through the implications of that. It's a long view \u2013 we speak about returns over time. We try hard not to get tangled up and candidly this quarter, next quarter. But we managed this business to generate returns over time, and one of the questions that we long to ask ourselves is, in the investment environment that's available and given other investments? We recognize that we compete against other investments, including investments that are fixed income.", "We have land numbers of 3% yield at the moment, what are the implications of that? How do we think about our company? And what do we strive to produce for investors in a very different investment environment that existed even a couple of years ago. And it's a very legitimate question and we're ankle-deep in it at the moment as we try and weigh our weight through it. It's complex. Obviously, no one company can adopt the strategy that's disruptive in the marketplace and thinks somehow that it will be successful. We operate in a very competitive environment. So you have to balance all of those factors. More to follow, I just know immediate, clear answers about that issue, but a very relevant question.", "Operator", "Miss Nawi, I will now turn the call back to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you very much for joining us this morning. If anybody has any additional questions, you can reach either myself or Andrew Hersom, Investor Relations Department.

[Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, thank you, Shante. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2011 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.  ", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. ", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available on the Investors section on our website.  Thank you, and now to Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. By now you've seen our numbers, and we're very pleased with our results. At 14.1%, our operating return on equity for the quarter reflected solid underwriting and investment income, as well as the continuation of our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders. ", "Our average annual operating return on equity since January 2005, coincidentally, is also 14.1%, within our overtime return objectives and meaningfully in excess of our average cost of equity over the period. The total return to our shareholders over this period is also very strong at 86%. ", "In Business Insurance, we're also pleased to see the continued success of the pricing strategy we have discussed with you previously, as well as a continuation of improving exposure trends. While Brian will take you through the details, in both Business and Personal Insurance, we were able to achieve gains in pricing, evidencing our view that pricing is an active pursuit, rather than a passive response. ", "In our Business Insurance segment, almost every production indicator improved this quarter. Retention was up, we achieved pricing gains, and exposure, which is unit demand by renewing customers, improved. In addition, we continue to increase our number of accounts during the quarter. We fundamentally believe that a number of these indicators are the result of active management and not the result of a rising tide lifting all boats. ", "Our pricing strategy is premised on real value added to agents and customers and our industry-leading analytics, which we apply to pricing and risk selection. Most importantly, we have applied this strategy thoughtfully and with the mindset not to be disruptive to either our agents or customers. These analytics give us very important advanced insight into class and account profitability, not only at the management level but critically at the desk underwriting level, allowing us to better determine account rate needs, risk selection and produce superior portfolio returns over time. ", "The feedback we received is that both agents and customers recognize the value proposition doing business with Travelers. It's not the insurance agreement, which anyone can write, but the combination of the agreement with market-leading product breadth, superior claims execution, risk control skill, and our extraordinary people with underwriting authority positioned in the local market. Simply said, we believe doing business with us creates value for agents and customers. ", "As we've been saying for some years now, for a number of reasons, we believe that the amplitude, that is the highs and lows of the so-called pricing cycle in our industry, may very well have moderated significantly. Given our position, as well as the analytic skill we just discussed, we are not waiting for some change in the mythical cycle to seek improved returns. We are increasingly optimistic about our ability to succeed in this regard, given the signs we see of a more receptive environment, particularly because we intend to execute this strategy in a targeted and measured way.  It is worth a look at Slide 9, where you can see the actual results of this approach. Brian will have more to say about this later, and we will discuss our view on cycles more at our upcoming Investor Day. ", "In short, we're pleased with the quarter, and we feel good about our competitive position. We've now seen two quarters of improving rate in Business Insurance and five consecutive quarters of positive rate, while growing policies in Personal Insurance. We like what we see. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jay. As the data we provided shows, we've produced first quarter operating income of $826 million, up 31% from the prior year quarter and up 55% per diluted share, translating into a strong operating ROE of 14.1%. The major drivers of these increases in operating income and operating income per diluted share were a significant reduction in catastrophe losses as compared to the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $122 million after-tax, down from $312 million after-tax in the prior year quarter. ", "That said, we would still characterize the current quarter as having combined weather and quake-related losses, whether considered cats or smaller events, that were higher than what we would consider to be typical. And we also had tax benefits of $104 million in the current quarter that mostly related to the closing out of recent tax years and the very meaningful effect of our common share repurchase program on per share results. ", "Net investment income also increased due to solid performance in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. Partially offsetting these benefits was a $37 million after-tax reduction in net favorable prior-year reserve development. Net favorable prior-year reserve development, which we once again experienced in each of our business segments, was $155 million after-tax in the current quarter, as compared to $192 million after-tax in the prior-year quarter. ", "So, all in all, particularly in light of the higher than typical cat and non-cat weather and quake-related losses that I previously referred to, we are off to a good start for the year. ", "Book value per share of $59.91 increased 2% in the current quarter, after repurchasing $1.1 billion of common stock and paying $155 million in dividends, and increased 12% from a year ago, after repurchasing $4.7 billion of common stock and paying $657 million in dividends. ", "Our cash flow remains very strong. Operating cash flow was $633 million in the current quarter, up from $531 million in the prior-year quarter, and we could not be happier with our balance sheet. ", "And finally, our continued strong results and financial position allowed the company to increase its quarterly dividend per share by 14% from $0.36 to $0.41. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.9 billion that was once again well in excess of our target but down from the $3.6 billion we held at the end of 2010. This reduction in holding company liquidity was in line with our plan and relates back to our $1.1 billion common share repurchases in the quarter. ", "Entering the year, our original estimate for full year 2011 common share repurchases was based upon our estimate of after-tax operating income plus $1.5 billion, which translated into a particular dollar amount at that time. Currently, we have chosen not to change that dollar amount for full year 2011 share repurchases, notwithstanding the first quarter's favorable reserve development which our estimates never incorporate, due to it still being very early in the year and the inherent uncertainties in our business. ", "Brian is now going to provide some further insight into our underwriting results.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. We had a great quarter, and we're pleased to be starting out the year in such a positive way. In addition to posting strong earnings, we are particularly pleased with what we are seeing in the underlying business dynamics. ", "Business Insurance delivered strong results this quarter. Let me begin with operating earnings, which increased over last year, driven by lower cats and the tax benefit that Jay mentioned. While cats are lower than last year, it was still a very active weather quarter, and cat losses were higher than what we considered typical. In addition, prior year development was somewhat less than in 2010 but still significant at $93 million after-tax. Core underwriting margins remained solid but contracted modestly as loss cost continued to slightly outpace earned rate changes, in line with our expectations. ", "Net written premiums grew almost 7 points year-over-year. The increase was driven by improved pricing, renewing customers purchasing more insurance as the economy improved and account growth. Higher business receipts and/or payrolls for these customers drove increased exposure in [ph] units, in our renewal premium. Additionally, audit premiums were positive for the first time since the second quarter of 2009. ", "Our price change or pure rate was positive quarter-over-quarter and even trended up month-to-month within the quarter. At the same time, retention rose 2 points to 84%. New business flow remained strong, while new business written premiums were down slightly from last year. ", "Page 8 demonstrates the significant improvement in renewal premium change that we've experienced since 2009. Some of this is clearly driven by the broader economic environment, but it is also a result of how we execute in the marketplace. Much of the market commentary implies that there's only one marketplace and that all accounts renew at the same or similar rates. At least for us, that's not the case. So we're not waiting for a market cycle change. Instead, we believe in a much more active strategy, a strategy based on superior analytics, a broad breadth of products, excellent positioning in the distribution channel and great local point of sale talent. ", "The data on Slide 9 shows the distribution of price changes on our Commercial Accounts business in the first quarter. This is a midsized account business with over 5,100 accounts renewing in the quarter. In the aggregate, 2/3 of these accounts got some level of increase. But importantly, there's a wide distribution of price changes, with some accounts getting greater than 10% increases and others, 10% decreases. So we believe this clearly demonstrates that it's not one pricing environment and that given our competitive advantages, we can target the accounts that need price and take the right actions deal by deal. Through this thoughtful and targeted execution, we can get rate where needed and minimize disruption to our agents and customers. We believe this dynamic is one that is not well recognized or appreciated by industry observers, and we believe it is meaningful. ", "Turning to Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. Operating income was up over the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower catastrophe losses. While written and earned premiums have been reduced in the current and recent quarters, the work we have done to improve risk and reward in the catastrophe-prone lines in our Lloyd's syndicate successfully mitigated losses this quarter. ", "Net written premiums were down in the quarter, primarily due to the Lloyd\u2019s initiative I just mentioned, the timing of renewal of some accounts written in the first quarter of last year that will become available for renewal later this year and the termination late last year of an exclusive distribution relationship in Ireland that we mentioned previously. ", "Looking at Bond & Financial products. In Surety, we continue to see a market challenge for growth, due largely to the continued sluggishness in construction spending. In addition, we're beginning to see evidence of more aggressive competition, including relaxed terms and conditions in order to win business. We will continue to maintain our underwriting discipline and look to grow where it makes sense. ", "In Management Liability, while growth remains a challenge, this is an area where we've invested in new product and technology, and we believe we are well positioned to grow as the market improves. ", "Finally, I wanted to give you an update on our joint venture in Brazil that we announced in November. We continue to expect the transaction to close in the second quarter and remain excited about the opportunity this arrangement gives us to leverage our leading U.S. Surety franchise to enter the growing Brazilian market and to expand more broadly into PNC and to do so with the benefit of a local market leader. ", "Moving to Personal Insurance, we are pleased with our overall underwriting results, and we had another quarter of solid production with continued growth in both policies enforced and net written premium. From a financial perspective, reported cats and prior year development for the segment were favorable year-over-year. However, underwriting results were impacted by a significant amount of non-cat weather that affected the industry in the quarter. We remained pleased with the underlying profitability of the segment. ", "As with our Commercial Lines businesses, we manage Personal Insurance consistent with our financial strategy of delivering mid-teen return on equity over time. As such, we are committed to maintaining target profitability as we look to achieve our desired growth within these confines. To that end, we have been making some targeted but aggressive rate actions particularly in the homeowner space, which has been adversely impacted by weather trends in the last few years. We believe that our rate actions are well justified given these loss trends. ", "In summary, we feel terrific about the results this quarter. While we are still operating in a fluid and challenging market environment, we are clearly beginning to see some improvement and are cautiously but increasingly optimistic that this trend will continue. Both execution across all our business segments and how we are positioning going forward are very strong. ", "With that, let me turn it back to Jay Fishman for a closing comment.", "Jay Fishman", "Thanks, Brian. Just as I've said any number of times before, a lot of our own folks listening to this call, if not today, then they will over the next few days. It was a really busy first quarter for all our folks in claim, and obviously given the activity in April, it continues to be a busy time, and they are all out there hopping. I just want to let them know that we know that, and what they are going to do today and what they do every day really makes a difference for us. ", "And with that, let's open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "First question just on Business Insurance, the pricing that we\u2019re seeing here. I guess I was definitely surprised about pricing being up and your retention being up at the same time. Now could you just give us a little more color behind that? Was there some potentially pent-up pricing maybe from the recession or are you using -- is this expected frequency ticking up from a recovery that you're factoring into your pricing? Just maybe a little bit more color around that.", "Jay Fishman", "Let's tag team this a little. It certainly, Kevin (sic) [Keith], isn't driven by a concern about frequency or anything of that nature. I'd say if there's anything in the back of at least my mind, it's that, it's possible that this investment return environment may turn out to be longer rather than shorter. And as I've said on previous calls, when rates change pretty dramatically pretty quickly, we certainly didn't knee-jerk \u2013 have a knee-jerk reaction with respect to our pricing. That would obviously be disruptive to both agents and customers. And now that we're 18, 24 months into it, I think it's prudent that we be thoughtful of the possibility, mindful of the possibility that this could be longer rather than shorter. And so it is targeted, it's moderate, it's thoughtful. And I think that, that slide on Page 9 really speaks articulately to the issue, 2/3 of the accounts, we were successful in getting rate increases. And yet with retention, that stayed at historical levels, historically high levels. So I think it speaks to the value of the franchise. I think it speaks to the way in which the company is regarded by agents and customers. And I think you always have to remember -- there's a tendency of lots of folks to lump all of us together as one industry. We are a small and middle-market company. And if you get a point and a half of rate on $100,000 premium account, that's $1,500. And so, if we do this thoughtfully, and I think in a measured way, we are optimistic that we can be successful. And is there anything, Brian, that you would...", "Brian MacLean", "No, I think it's -- that's the message.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. And then the second question would be, if you could speak to the RMS [Risk Management Solutions] model changes on inland wind that we're seeing out there. First of all, do you use RMS? And then secondly, if you could just talk to the changes in your PML in Florida, Texas and the mid-Atlantic from the model changes that we've seen?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. So this is Brian. We absolutely use RMS. But we don't use it exclusively. We use every available model that you can think of that we\u2019re out there working with. So we work with a number of folks. I'm not going to be able to give you an answer as specific as what you asked for. It's a significant change to their model. It's a complicated process, and we've been heavily involved working with them for quite a while now. Some of the things that they're contemplating in the model, like inland exposures from the storm, we'd already been looking at pretty significantly. But there are a number of things that they are changing. And like I said, we're working with them. So it'll be later in the year before we're going to come out with anything definitive on -- as in well into the third quarter probably, before we come out with anything on what the model changes will actually mean.", "Keith Walsh - Citigroup Inc", "So would we expect changes in your -- the way you think about capital heading into next year then? January of next year or late in the year is what you're referring to?", "Brian MacLean", "What we've got to look at, obviously, is as we sort through all the changes in the model, we've got to look at what that does to our expectation of losses. As I said, it's not the only model we use. So we're going to take that output. We're going to look at the other models. We're to look at all of our internal data, and we're going to assess where that is. As it moves, we can figure the conjecture on a bunch of different possibilities of what that could mean.", "Jay Benet", "As it relates specifically to capital, we will be evaluating what we think the model has done to our exposure base. So our exposure base doesn't change the models. Measurement of it changes perhaps. But ultimately, we'll be in discussions as I'm sure all of our counterparts will be with rating agencies and see what rating agencies think of the new models. And we start in all of our capital planning with -- as we've said, many, many times before, having operating company capital levels at the AA levels. So we'll just continue to do that process.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Could you give a little bit more color on the action at Lloyds and kind of what you're expecting from that business for the rest of the year? And I just have one follow-up.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure, Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. When you look at our experience over the recent years, we've just had more really severity and volatility out of that business than we'd really like. And so we've taken a step back just to reassess risk and reward, and obviously, we're starting on the risk side and taking some exposures down as we think about that and making sure that we're taking all the analytics and thought processes that we have in the U.S. and driving it into those businesses as well. So, we started this analysis in 2009. We worked through that, and slowly, we've been increasing the implementation. And we'll be working through it for a couple of more quarters and starting to look more at the opportunity side as we start to put some of the analytics and thought process in place. And when you look at the decrease in written premium anyway, in the international, if that's what you're looking at, you're only about -- a third of that relates to what we're doing on the Lloyd's book. There's another -- about a third that relates to some timing, some accounts that were 18 months when written and will be available for renewal later in the year. There's a little bit of reinsurance, reinstatement premium, and we've got the termination of the distribution arrangement in Ireland, which will continue for the rest of this year to run through the top line, although that piece won't have a significant impact on profitability.", "Jay Fishman", "Let me just jump in. I think Alan just because he's leading this effort, tends to kind of understate it a little bit. We've talked for years about the nature of analytical skill and our ability to evaluate risk and reward. In the U.S. and all of our operations here, that skill base was not nearly at the same level in our International business broadly. But I think it was particularly true in Lloyd's, although maybe not, maybe it was more balanced than that. And the effort that Alan has been doing is to bring the same level of analytics, as well as the same level of interpretation of those analytics to the business that we do in our international operations. And so ultimately, it'll turn out, at least initially, to be somewhat smaller. I think it will give us an awfully good platform to move ahead and to build the business with the sense of confidence, the same sense of confidence that we have here in the U.S. So it's very much a voluntary effort designed to bring that risk and reward profile in line with what we do here in the U.S.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. And then I have one question in commercial accounts. I noticed in your -- the Q you talked about margins being slightly narrower for the rest of the year in Business Insurance I believe and referencing kind of Brian's point of loss trend outpacing pricing. And then, obviously in the first quarter, you saw a big increase in commercial accounts. I'm just trying to reconcile those trends and make sure I understand on the thought process behind the outlook and then the increase in exposures in the quarter.", "Jay Fishman", "I think, again, Brian and I will tag team this. First, always keep in mind that our P&L, our GAAP financial statements, are based upon earned premium. And as a consequence, they reflect more of the rate dynamics of the past 12 months than they do the past quarter. You book it -- if it\u2019s a 12-month policy, you book it for 12 months and you amortize it in. And so the rate picture that we're providing this morning is in the written premium arena, which obviously, will affect earned premiums down the road. And what really you're seeing here, at least in the GAAP statement, is that -- and what we anticipated, which is that the earned price, the earned rate that's reflected in earned premium, we expected that to be less than what we were contemplating for embedded loss trend for loss reserving purposes. So as a consequence, we were anticipating a modest margin contraction in Business Insurance. And we are seeing very much that, and it was actually reasonably predictable at the time. So that's the earned piece with respect to written, and there was a...", "Brian MacLean", "Just to restate some of the metrics and without being overly precise, but we've been pretty transparent. In the first quarter -- our last quarter, our view on what we were seeing across our Business Insurance market from a loss side was relatively flat frequency and lower single digits inflation on the severity side, and that has not changed. You can see where our premium change numbers were, and you can kind of make whatever estimate you want on where you think premiums changes are going to go for the rest of the year and see when you think those lines might be crossing on a written basis. But we still got a little bit of contraction going. So I don't know of those pieces add up for you.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. And then just \u2013 workers\u2019 comp it looked like was a big driver. It looks like just from the math, that most of that -- the change in commercial accounts was workers comp. I guess first question, is that right? And if you could just talk specifically about the decision to pursue more business there and kind of what that means?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. This is Brian again. On the comp side, that is the line across Business Insurance that's growing the most. It's also the line across Business Insurance where we're getting the most price improvement. And I'd say in every line within Business Insurance this quarter, we got from price improvement. But comp was definitely at the front end. Comp\u2019s a line that's gotten a lot of lot of publicity. If you look at our results over the last 10-plus years now, we've run a pretty significant favorable delta to the industry on a loss and combined ratio side. So we feel great about our selection in there. We feel great about our risk control capabilities and the claim capability that we have. And so, it is a line that we feel good about, but very, very select though.", "Jay Fishman", "Spend 30 seconds on the National Account business and the ability to export that skill.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I mean, we've got a very large account comp business, which is primarily loss responsive, as in taking credit risk, not underwriting risk. And that has enabled us, over the last 20 years, really, the scale of that, has enabled us to build claim and risk control capabilities and pricing selection tools, which we would not have been able to afford to build had we just had the guaranteed cost book that we've had over the years. So we think we've got a real scale and data advantage here and a technology and tools advantage that make a big difference in the marketplace. So we feel good about our comp book.", "Jay Fishman", "An example of that is out in the claim organization. You'll actually see nurses sitting side-by-side with claim handlers managing claim. I don't know, what do we have, close to $2.5 billion, $3 billion of claims under management in our National Account business? That provides two things. Brian got it exactly right: an expertise that we can export into the smaller guaranteed cost segments and also a scale because comp is fundamentally a state-by-state business. There are -- and you've really going to get very focused and very narrow in your analysis of it. So the combination of the scale, the expertise that exists predominantly in that National Accounts business is a real competitive advantage.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Two questions for you. First, kind of following up on the last question, can you talk about the potential for loss frequency to start to increase a bit as the economy recovers? I know that's kind of a broad issue but focus more on commercial, I guess as well as personal. And then, second issue, do you anticipate Travelers\u2019 reinsurance costs could rise, and if that were to happen, would Travelers buy less coverage?", "Brian MacLean", "On the loss frequency side, Jay -- yes, clearly as we talked about on the other side of the coin, as the economy contracted, it actually creates a favorable dynamic within the comp world in that most businesses lay off the least experienced workers first and safety gets a little bit better and you're running fewer shifts and all that kind of stuff. If the economy really started to heat up, we would see some of that. We looked very closely, we haven't seen anything yet, and although the movement has been positive, it hasn't been that dramatic that we think it has changed those dimensions. Similarly, as you said, within all the lines, including personal lines, we're looking for any indications that economic growth is going to push frequency up, which it naturally will. I think the bottom line is the same across all our businesses. We're looking really hard, we haven't seen anything yet, and we think it's the magnitude of the pickup in economic activity hasn't been enough to drive that yet. But it's a great question and one that we'll be watching closely.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "The reinsurance?", "Jay Fishman", "Bill just handed me a note. I think a better estimate of the claim -- I said $2.5 billion to $3 billion of claims under management. $2 billion to $2.5 billion is a better estimate for claims under management in national accounts. A combination of loss response and that which we have, well, due to [ph] service and guaranteed costs -- not guaranteed costs, loss responsive [ph]. We don't actually buy all that much catastrophe coverage broadly speaking. We have $1 billion retention. In the next $1.25 billion, our recovery, and this is round numbers, is about $500 million or so. And that's obviously a pretax number. So at a $2.25 billion loss, we have a $500 million recovery, pretax. We paid whatever we paid for the coverage, on a net recovery basis, in the first event, then you got to pay the reinstatement premium, you actually have modest recovery in that first event. It's really a second event reinsurance program, and we don't actually buy much, except the only area where it's important to us is in the Northeast. We actually have obviously the cat bond, and we have a separate Northeast wind cover that's meaningful given our exposures. And we wouldn't expect -- I don't know how to respond to the Northeast and the bond issue longer term, but in the context of the standard reinsurance market, we wouldn't expect a significant increase in dollars because what we pay for the policy is actually is not all that much. So even if it goes up some, it's not going to be a meaningful change in dollars.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "So do you anticipate -- I mean, there's a lot of controversy right now in terms of whether all the significant catastrophe losses in Asia-Pacific are going to sort of bleed over to the U.S.? What are your thoughts there?", "Jay Fishman", "I think you should ask the reinsurers. I have no idea.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Not to make this all about workers\u2019 comp, but I was just curious on the non-guaranteed cost side, with the economy picking up, and presumably, that would mean that the Dallas is under management probably go up too. Is the outlook for the C [ph] income you generate on the business potentially going to get better over the next couple of years?", "Brian MacLean", "The short answer, Matt, is yes. We're all anxious and watch the economy and what it actually does, but we're seeing a little bit of a lift, and we would expect that to continue.", "Jay Fishman", "It's actually interesting the -- I think this is what I'm about to say is correct. The private market workers\u2019 compensation premium was $38 billion in 2007. The estimate for 2010, once all the data is in, is $28 billion. 10 on 38 obviously, almost 25% reduction driven by the combination of lower employment and some decline in rate. So, the change in workers\u2019 comp in the market broadly speaking has been really quite significant, and it will be interesting to see to the extent that employment begins to recover to what extent that $28 billion begins to lift back up in the direction of that historical high.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Just on the -- specifically on the Management Liability piece when I was looking at the presentation in terms of the rate change there, that was one that stood out relative to a lot of the channel checks and market commentaries being a bit different, because most competitors, I think, are describing that as more competitive and rates moving down 5% to 10%. I know some people are minimizing rate declines by changing kind of the position that they have on contracts. So could you just maybe give a little bit more color on that book specifically in terms of just the rate and maybe it's a product issue, too, but...", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure, it's Alan Schnitzer. It's tough to answer those questions because people think about Management Liability broadly again as one thing, and it's really not. We've got different business units, so what we see in financial institutions behaves differently than what we see in public company liability versus what we see in private nonprofit. DNO is different than ENO is different than employee practices liability. So it's really hard to answer that on a portfolio basis. If I think about what's impacting us, the majority of our premium there is in our private nonprofit book, so the smaller account. And the rate dynamic there has been different and I'd say less significant than what we've seen in the larger account side. So that's probably the distinction I would make on rate.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then how about on the FI and the public commercial DNO side? Can you just give a little commentary to what you're seeing there?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure. I'm not sure if you're -- if this is about -- if you\u2019re talking about rate of the loss side, but on the rate side...", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "More on the rate side.", "Alan Schnitzer", "On the rate side, I think that as you get in larger account sizes, almost regardless of the industry or the product line. The larger account sizes are -- the rate environment is more competitive. So I think the same would apply in public company liability and FI as compared to, say, at private non-profit book.", "Operator", "And our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Looking at the resolution of prior tax matters, the one-time tax item? It's consolidated under the underwriting gain, I guess the way you define it. Can you sort of walk through a little bit how that hits the P&L?", "Jay Benet", "In terms of the way we manage our expenses and income, we, as a rule, take all of the items and allocate to the various business segments. We don't have a large corporate component to our expense structure or our revenue structure, as you can see when you look through the information that we have in our 10-K and 10-Q. So, when we have things like tax matters that get settled, we go back to the segments that gave rise to them in the first place. And to the extent there's a tax benefit, it just goes right back to the segment. So that's what drives the earnings piece of it. As it relates to other elements of it like combined ratio, combined ratio is a pretax concept. So the tax benefit has absolutely no impact whatsoever on the combined ratio.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "My apologies, I misunderstood that. Thank you for clarifying. The second question I have is I'm looking at the historical financials. I noticed in the past, some of the previous slide from prior conference calls have different numbers than the previous ones, in terms of -- is this audit premiums going back and revising the past slides?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, you're talking about the production statistics that we might have on rate and renewal price change and exposure, right?", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Yes.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, so those numbers developed, just like -- not a dissimilar concept to loss numbers developing. So as we go through, we're looking at the monthly/quarterly production numbers. We're reporting the same numbers that we look at internally as to what we think is going on with the pricing and the retention and the renewal. But invariably, they were going to be accounts, for example, that we believe we thought at the close of the month we'd retained and we find out two weeks later that we actually did not. So those come out of the statistics. So the numbers do move.", "Jay Benet", "And we do put a notation on the slides, as well as anywhere where we provide estimates associated with statistics that we use to run our business that these are, in part, actuarial estimates subject to change, and when they change, we restate the past.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Very good. And finally, one more question on workers comp. Is there anything, broadly speaking, you can talk to how these statistics look different excluding the workers comp?", "Brian MacLean", "No. We don't have them. I mean, we could calculate them obviously, but we don't disclose them, right.", "Jay Fishman", "We don't disclose at that level of granularity.", "Gabriella Nawi", "[Operator Instructions]", "Brian MacLean", "I would reiterate what I said before, though, is that across Business Insurance, we had great improvement across all the lines of business. So it wasn't just comp, but comp had the greatest.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "My two questions are cap deployment and then the direct auto initiative. On cap deployment, I just wanted to clarify that the guidance was indeed increased from the last time you guys gave us your thoughts. Specifically, it was increased by the amount of reserved releases, as well as the after-tax impact of the tax scheme [ph]. Is that true?", "Jay Benet", "Actually, I would say just the opposite. We entered the year with a view as to what our share buybacks were going to be. We gave you some insight in the first quarter -- in the fourth quarter press release -- I\u2019m sorry, in the fourth quarter webcast as to how to think about that. It's very early in the year, and we're, at this point in time, not changing our view internally as to what the overall level of buybacks are going to be for the full year 2011.", "Jay Fishman", "It's worth going back a little bit because this is a little -- it's unusual and somewhat out of context. A year ago we said that we were going to stop giving earnings per share guidance in 2011. But we also said that we would provide meaningful insight into what we plan to do from the share buyback perspective because that's a number that we believed was really not determinable from the outside looking in. So the way that we did that, back at the first quarter was to say that at least for our own planning purposes, that we were assuming that the share buybacks would be our estimate of earnings plus $1.5 billion. And that, of course, allowed observers to make their own estimates. And so, while it's funny to be talking about guidance of an individual item that's not tied in some way to earnings guidance, what we are attempting to say is, notwithstanding the results in the first quarter, whatever they were, at least for our own purposes at the moment, we continue to assume the same dollar level that we did when we gave that information three months ago.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. But I guess from my perspective, we all have different estimates of what the after-tax op income will be. When we exit the year, whatever your after-tax op income is, plus $1.5 billion, is what the share buyback will be for 2011. Is that -- am I understanding it appropriately?", "Jay Fishman", "Well, the share buyback will be whatever it turns out to be, right? Whatever, and there's a lot of things between now and the end of the year that may, in fact, affect that one way or another. But for planning purposes, what we again tried to give you was at least some guidance, so that you'll be able to make those estimates for yourself. And I think -- not I think. What we're really saying to you is not to adjust to that number on a very granular quarter-by-quarter basis, if we think something has changed, we'll certainly let you know. But, it's not -- it just isn't quite as formulated as the notion of earnings plus $1.5 billion. We wanted to -- the reason we did that was we were intentionally stepping away from the process of giving earnings guidance. And so we were trying to be as transparent as we could in the circumstance and give you as much information as we could, to the extent that there are circumstances during the year that arise, good or bad, that cause us to think about that share buyback in some meaningfully different way, we will continue to give you the insight that we're capable of giving. Our advice here is not to overreact to your perception of the first quarter.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "Great. And then also on capital deployment, could you just address the dividend. The increase is a healthy increase. What is your dividend policy and how did you settle in on $0.41 a share as being the right number as opposed to something else?", "Jay Fishman", "Well, you know $0.40 could\u2019ve been right also. It\u2019s not -- again, it's hardly that precise. But our mindset has been to set a dividend level that reflects the fact that we're in a business that has great earnings volatility. We always recognize that the 1-in-1,000 event could happen this year. And it could happen twice this year. Just because it's 1-in-1,000 doesn't mean that it's 0. It's possible. So our goal is to evaluate our cash flows, recognizing that the share buyback has reduced the number of shares significantly overtime. Actually, I think in about half at this point, we're down to about half of the shares when we started. So we are able to increase the dividend I think thoughtfully, but always keep it at a level that even looking at the tail risks of our business, it would be unlikely -- I don't want to say 0 again. We\u2019re not a 0 basis kind of company. But it would be unlikely to be in a position of having to make a change in that regard. So, and what we do is to the extent that there is additional capital above and beyond that, we obviously deploy it in the share buyback program. So that's the thinking. And it really, it doesn't -- it actually is not driven by a set payout ratio because our earnings can change meaningfully based upon natural events or otherwise. It's set at a level where we have a reasonable degree of confidence that in a lot of scenarios, that we would be in a position of being able to support a continuation of the dividend.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley", "And then just on the direct business, the direct auto initiative, it's obviously growing very -- it looks like it's up almost 50% year-over-year just premiums. There is a P&L drag as well. But just curious, your updated thoughts on that trajectory and where this potentially could go over time?", "Jay Fishman", "Greg and I will tag team this as well. When we set on this venture, we were very clear and transparent that this was long-term in nature. And we are not yet at that long-term level. We are still very much -- meaning we are still in the process of learning and learning enough to what we hope, ultimately, will put us in a position to be able to deploy the resources of this company in a thoughtful, substantive way and actually grow that business, hopefully, meaningfully. We don't yet know enough to do that. We don't know enough about the pricing of the product. We don't yet know enough about how to convert quotes into sales at a level that's likely to produce a long-term, profitable return. So our investment in this regard is as in effect as little as it can be, while still allowing us to learn as much as we're capable of learning. And that's a real trade-off that we decide every year. So it's still, I would say, at best -- it may not be the early days, it's later, it's certainly further on than that. You will see a change this year in our advertising program to be more of an \u201coperators are standing by\u201d type of advertising. For those of you who aren't old enough to remember what that means, it's really the decades-ago dynamic of call now. Call now, we're going to obviously not embrace the call-now dynamic, but you are going to see more of a drive to action-oriented advertising. And we'll see how responsive that is. I think you can talk about the digital world too, as long as we're at it.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Sure. This is Greg Toczydlowski. Just to echo Jay's comments, I'll start with the assessment. We're as encouraged today as when we started the investment around where the future value of that is. We've spent a lot of time, as Jay talked about, in the advertising arena, not only in creating and executing ads but trying to understand an attribute, the sales across all the mediums, the one that Jay just talked about was on the digital front. We're spending a lot of time inside that arena and really working the search optimization and display-type ads and building good capability there. And I certainly don't want to pick at your words, but there is a little bit of a bias in the industry that -- I think your words were \u201cthe direct auto initiative.\u201d If you look at the statistical supplement, you'll see -- do some quick math and over 40% of the PIF is in the property lines. And we really think that's where we -- we've a long-term strategic competitive advantage there with the breadth of our product and the strength of that property line. And I think consumers have seen that. So in the early days, we're very pleased what -- how we're building that capability and what the profile of the customers look like.", "Jay Fishman", "We've also hired some two terrific leaders in the last year for that business: one out of Microsoft and one out of the direct industry, not insurance, but someone with real skill in building a direct response business. And so, these are all steps in the right direction to building what we hope will be a successful venture.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.", "Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Know that most of the increase in your accident year ex-cat combined ratio for personal was non-cat weather. But you had said in the first quarter, excuse me, coming out of last year, that you expected personal lines premium \u2013 personal lines margins to be improving this year. And I mean, adjusted for the non-cat weather, I'm just curious whether you still feel that way?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Good morning, Larry, this is Greg Toczydlowski again. Yes, up to this quarter, we certainly did see relatively low loss cost trends, both frequency and severity. And we saw rate outpacing that. Clearly this quarter, we could see was in the weather lines, and then we really segment the data and look at a geography level and the coverage line, we could see it predominantly in the physical damage coverages. So when we looked -- that we're expecting normal weather patterns for the rest of the year, we still believe in that statement that our loss cost trends will be offset with slightly more rate.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes and I've just observed that God has His own plan for the weather. And while obviously that statement is always going to be measured relative to -- in particularly in the non-cat area where obviously, we're out of pattern here for the first three months anyway.", "Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Sure. I appreciate that. And then second question, Brian, your comments on Surety competition, can you just elaborate a little bit? Is that just coming from the traditional players? Are you seeing any new capacity moving into that area?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Larry, it's Alan Schnitzer, I\u2019ll take that. I would say that we are continuing to see a lot of capacity and just a lot more bold activity on the part of previously existing capacity. I wouldn't say that it's necessarily new entrants into the marketplace, although there's always puts and takes on that as well.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Jay Cohen with Bank of America.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "I\u2019ve got two questions. The first is in looking at the Select Account business, and you've had consistent renewal rate improvements there. I guess I'm assuming that a fair amount of this business gets renewed fairly automatically with some modest increases, and it's not too much of a push to get those increases. Is that oversimplifying it?", "Brian MacLean", "You know, slightly, but directionally, it's right. And we're obviously looking at that class by class, so it's not -- we talk about the individually underwritten stuff and deal by deal. I don't want to imply that this is just one big bucket. But we are looking at industry classes and kind of bucketing it that way. But directionally, Jay, you're right. A lot of it is automatically handled. On the express side, about 80% of that business goes through without being touched by a person. And there's obviously ability to drive a little bit of price through there that we've been successful with. And like you said, you can see the numbers on whatever that is, Page 11, that would reinforce that.", "Jay Fishman", "And the statistics I last looked at in Select was that 80% of the accounts have not had a loss in the last 3 years, and as a consequence, the loss experience for an individual account is not terribly relevant but the size of the book and the ability to determine the right price for the class is what the secret sauce is all about. And so that's what we're responding to there is the loss dynamics from a class perspective.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And then the other question. I forget exactly who used the word, but -- maybe it was Brian, when you were talking about rate increases, you suggested the environment was becoming more receptive. I think most of your discussion on the pure rate environment has been about your efforts to target selectively rates and getting the right price for the right risk, but are you seeing a reaction by your competitors to act in a more disciplined fashion? Obviously it\u2019ll vary a lot by a line of business and by size of account. But is there any underlying trend where that might be the case?", "Jay Fishman", "Brian and I, we\u2019re going to tag team this a little bit. We often get asked, who's stepping on the gas? There\u2019s lot of different ways to ask that question. And the anecdotal observation that we have to that is nobody. We just haven't seen competition -- we just haven't seen competition where we turn back and we scratch our head. Broadly speaking, you could always find an individual account or an individual transaction that doesn't make sense to one carrier versus another. But it's not as if we look broadly at the marketplace and we say, \u201cGee, we can't figure that strategy out.\u201d And it's been interesting because, again, I think the observers to the industry have perceived that there is someone like that. And I think -- I know there's actually been some commentary to that effect. We haven't seen -- we don't come to that conclusion. And I think it's evidenced in the retention rates that are universally strong amongst the best competitors. Now ours, I think, if you look at the real data, ours is probably the highest. But when you look at what we think of as the great middle market accounts, they're all historically at pretty solid levels relative to their own circumstances, and if there were someone who were really acting that way, carrier or carriers, we think you'd see more churns. This gets back to our view of the kind of the mythical cycle dynamics. I find it interesting that people talk about it being a soft environment. And it may be at the top line. If you look at our earnings per share last year, before tax, look at all the earnings that we generate earnings per share pretax. Last year was actually our best earnings-per-share year ever. And you can say yes, it was favorable development, or it was this or it was that, the negative is investment returns have been challenged, but it's been interesting to us that the observation of the challenging marketplace, and we acknowledge that with respect to the top line, really hasn't translated through the bottom line, so...", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Brian MacLean", "Real quickly, Jay, at the beginning, as you teed it up, we tend to first and foremost look at our own information. So we look at the fact that as I said, throughout this quarter, and really through just about two straight quarters now, month by month, we've seen a little bit of improvement every month in pricing, and this month, we saw retention improved by 2 points, and we look at the combination of those, and it says we're not pushing too hard. We hear the rhetoric and the anecdotes just like you do. One of the things -- one of the reasons why we say we don't see the big amplitude in the cycle is that 5 years ago, certainly 10 years ago, in our offices, there would be all those anecdotes. Everyone would rattle off, \u201cThese are the two or three markets that are behaving crazy in the world today.\u201d And we don't get that same level of noise out of our folks. But you're right. We look at our own information first, and we feel good about our data. So...", "Operator", "And our last question is from the line of Vinay Misquith with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Just to follow up on Jay's question before, has an improving economy helped you and your ability to take rates up?", "Jay Fishman", "I try hard to separate what we know from what we speculate. I know the data. I know the numbers. Exactly why we've been successful in that strategy would be speculative on our part. It was interesting and I -- you can look at the data, when the economy was deteriorating, going back now just 2 or 3 years ago, we were actually able to move rate in the right direction. Now I don't know that it ever got positive, but it, certainly as the time went on, became less negative. Now that was -- that would be contrary to what one would think. So I'm respectful of the complexity of our industry and the data that comes at us. I can only share with you that we've been -- it would be hard to overestimate the nature of engagement of the leadership in Business Insurance and Personal Insurance with the folks in the field about how to operate in this environment. So I can tell you that the direction has been specific with clarity, one would even argue intense. That doesn't mean intense pressure, but an intense involvement. And whether that's attributable to an improving economy or the value of the franchise, which is sort of the one that I personally endorse, but I\u2019ll leave that to others to speculate more subsequently.", "Vinay Misquith - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG", "Fair enough. And this is a follow-up to that. How do you see pricing versus loss cost trends for the future based on where you're pricing right now?", "Jay Fishman", "I assume you're talking about written because earned is what it is. And that's baked in to our -- and I say baked in, it's very, very predictable. But we haven't -- just to be -- and then I'm going to turn it over to Brian. We haven't actually done the arithmetic to sit here and say that if rate continues to improve at this level and loss trend doesn't turn, when written rate would exceed loss trends. So we just haven't done it yet. But we're -- this is encouraging. The last couple of quarters is encouraging. And you...", "Brian MacLean", "I go back and repeat the numbers I said before about frequency and severity, and then we're not making a projection of what we think rate\u2019s going to be over the next however many quarters. But we are encouraged with the trends that we\u2019ve seen in the last 5 or 6 months now, and you can do the arithmetic. And we watch the loss cost closely and so any of the variables could move.", "Jay Fishman", "And again, we've just been a company that has refrained from making predictions about rate. There are so many variables: the economy, energy prices. All sorts of things interact with this. And so we're real pleased with what we did in the first quarter, we're feeling -- as I said in the press release, cautiously but increasingly optimistic, and we'll keep our fingers crossed for the second quarter. That's kind of been -- not that it's about luck but that the environment continues to be supportive of the strategy that we're employing. Operator, thank you.", "Operator", "You're very welcome.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, July 21, 2011. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Jennifer. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2011 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.

They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through our prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. ", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. ", "With that, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. ", "Given the fact that we disclosed as much as we did at our June 10 Investor Day, our results shouldn't be much of a surprise. In April and May, it was all weather all the time. Total after-tax catastrophe costs for the quarter were just under $1.1 billion, generating a loss for the quarter. The tornado and hailstorms in those 2 months were unprecedented in their size, scope, geographic dispersion and destructiveness. A loss of life was substantial, and our hearts go out to those who been personally impacted by the events. ", "In that regard, our immediate focus is on delivering outstanding claim service and support to those who have had losses. Our entire claim organization is very much on the case and energized to do this right. We're well aware of the demand that events like this place on the claim organization, and we're thankful for their dedication and professionalism. ", "We're also well aware that events of this magnitude will happen from time-to-time. It is critical that we price our product and manage our exposure thoughtfully. In that regard, we have great confidence in our data, analytical skill and underwriting expertise. Given the hail and tornado we experienced in the last few years, we are gaining a better and more granular understanding of the tail risk associated with these types of storms. Even in these early days following the April and May storms, we are focusing on improving rate and/or terms and conditions in those geographies that may be more exposed to these kinds of storms than history has suggested. ", "Importantly, it is events such as these that reinforce our view that the correct way of defining success in our business is to measure returns over time. While we are certainly not pleased that we had a loss in the quarter, we know we are on the right path in running our business appropriately. There is no lack of enthusiasm or optimism here. ", "In that regard, we are very encouraged that a number of important parameters of our business continue to improve. In Business Insurance, exposure in the quarter improved, and audit premiums, which were negative throughout the financial crisis, turned positive in the first quarter and grew meaningfully this quarter. Perhaps most importantly, we continue to be successful in delivering written rate improvements, particularly in Business Insurance. The overall pure renewal rate gain in Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, was just over 2% for the quarter, demonstrating the success we are having in driving rate improvement. Retention remains at very strong levels, and all of the anecdotal feedback from our organization remains solid. We are executing on this strategy effectively. ", "As we've said before, we are not waiting for some mythical turn in the P&C cycle to improve our pricing. We are driving rate improvement on a measured basis, particularly for those specific accounts where rate is needed to produce acceptable returns. ", "We are also encouraged that there are signs that economic activity may be improving. While it remains somewhat anecdotal, I was personally encouraged by the article of yesterday's Wall Street Journal on C2, in which a number of banks reported an uptick in commercial lending. Early results from the credit card sector, as well as results from the tech industry over the last few days, are also encouraging. And while it does seem that we are coming down to the wire with respect to a federal debt limit solution, it may be that they are the beginnings of a bipartisan agreement. And it is encouraging that more states are dealing with their own financial situations, building foundations for an improved fiscal outlook. ", "Before I turn it over to Jay, let me make a brief comment about our share repurchase philosophy. Simply put, it remains unchanged. Our premise for the creation of shareholder value is that we will generate top-tier earnings and return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The fact that we had a loss in the quarter rather than our historical level of earnings impacted our share repurchases, but only in the second quarter. With less internal capital generated, there's less capital to return. ", "On the premise that weather patterns return to more normal levels and our profitability returns to historical levels, and to the extent that the capital can be put back to work in our business for growth opportunities, we will continue buying back shares. ", "Summing up, while the weather was challenging, it is the business we are in. We're doing all the right things and remain on the right track to create superior shareholder value. ", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Jay. There are a few things I'd like to highlight about our operating results in the quarter. First, in early June at our Investor Day conference, we disclosed an expected range of $1.0 billion to $1.05 billion after-tax and reinsurance for cat losses relating to the extraordinary tornado and hailstorm activity that had occurred in April and May. While our current estimates for those storms remain within that range, additional storms that occurred in June brought total cat losses for the quarter up to $1.085 billion after-tax and reinsurance. ", "Second, we continue to see net favorable reserve development in each of our segments, although at a lesser amount this quarter in Business Insurance than we have experienced in recent quarters. ", "Third, x cat in TYG [ph], underwriting margins were impacted by several items in the quarter. The re-estimation of certain first quarter non-cat winter storm losses in Business and Personal Insurance, adverse current quarter non-cat weather-related losses in PI for both homeowners and auto, as well as a larger number of large dollar prior losses in Personal Insurance. Adjusting for all of these items, underlying underwriting margins were generally in line with our expectations, which included as we've previously anticipated and disclosed, modest margin compression in Business Insurance, where earned rate increases were not keeping pace with changes in underlying losses. ", "I'd also like to add that investment portfolio continued to perform very well. Net investment income was down slightly from the prior year quarter as the impacts of lower fixed income reinvestment rates and lower average assets, due to our share repurchase activity during the past 12 months, were mostly offset by strong performance in our non-fixed income investment portfolio. ", "Finally, our net unrealized investment gains net of tax increased by $400 million from the beginning of the quarter from $1.8 billion to $2.2 billion. ", "Book value per share of $59.62, although down less than 0.5 percentage point in the quarter due to the cat losses, has increased 2% since the beginning of the year and 7% in the past 12 months. Year-to-date we repurchased 1.3 billion of common stock including 237 million in the second quarter and paid $330 million in dividends. While in the past 12 months, we repurchased 3.5 billion of common stock and paid $659 million in dividends. ", "Our capital management strategy worked very well in the quarter and remains the same as it has been. Despite the extremely large cat losses, there was no meaningful change in our balance sheet strength between the beginning and end of the quarter. Shareholders' equity and stat surplus was still over $25 billion and $20 billion, respectively. Debt-to-total capital was 22.5%, well within our target range. And holding company liquidity was $2.4 billion, more than twice our target level. And based upon first half results and consistent with our announcement at Investor Day, we expect common share repurchases in the second half of the year to approximate $400 million in excess of second half operating income. ", "Finally, I'd also like to point out that we successfully renewed our cat treaties, keeping essentially the same structure, but at a slightly higher cost. The new treaties are outlined on Pages 19 and 20 of the webcast and are described more fully on our second quarter 10-Q, which was filed earlier today. ", "With that, Brian's now going to provide some further insight into our results.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. The obvious headline for our results this quarter was the extraordinary tornadoes and hailstorms that impacted the industry. To give you a perspective on the magnitude of these events, when measured as a percentage of our earned premiums, our cat losses this quarter were 12x our 20-plus year average for second quarter cats and almost 4x larger than our next largest second quarter, which happened to be last year. So clearly, the level of catastrophes we experienced this quarter was extraordinary. And in addition to the weather events that hit the catastrophe disclosure threshold, our second quarter combined ratio was significantly impacted my non-catastrophe weather events and developments on the first quarter winter storm activity. ", "The significant and unpredictable impact of weather, notwithstanding, we remained pleased with the underlying performance of the franchise and continue to see positive signs across our businesses and in the operating environment. ", "Beginning with Business Insurance, we had another very strong quarter for top line. Net written premiums continued their positive trend and were up year-over-year, driven by increases in pricing and exposure, along with modest account growth. Retention and new business levels, although down in the quarter, remained at high levels. ", "Looking at pricing, the momentum we saw in the first quarter accelerated, as the rate was up 2 points compared to 1 point of positive rate in the first quarter of 2011 and negative rate in the second quarter of 2010. We are encouraged that rate was positive for all lines of business, and in fact, increased in all lines of business from last quarter, with workers\u2019 compensation leading the way. ", "As we discussed last quarter, our pricing strategy is to actively manage rate in a thoughtful and targeted manner that seeks to minimize disruption to our agents and customers. We believe our results this quarter demonstrate that this strategy is working. We also see momentum in exposure, up over 1 point in the quarter compared to being essentially flat both last quarter and the second quarter of 2010. This growth in exposure, combined with the audit premiums that were positive for the second consecutive quarter, demonstrates that the improving economic trends we noted in the first quarter have continued. ", "Turning to operating earnings. We were impacted significantly by the cats that I just discussed, as well as by less favorable prior-year development versus the second quarter of 2010. Second quarter results have also been negatively impacted by approximately $40 million after-tax or about 2.2 loss ratio points for Business Insurance, due to the re-estimation of certain first quarter losses, primarily related to the development of non-catastrophe winter weather, and to a lesser extent, workers\u2019 compensation. ", "Overall, if you look at underlying Business Insurance margins on a year-to-date basis, they are about where we expected them to be. ", "Before I go to the other segments, I want to take a few minutes and talk about workers\u2019 compensation because there's a lot of anecdotal marketplace conversation about the line. Comp is one of our long tail lines of business, with a duration of about 8 years on a new block and 11 years for the reserves. We actively manage all our lines of business, and in the case of workers' comp, our conclusion is that in the aggregate, we feel very positive about our book. ", "On the severity side, we've not seen any substantial change in the risk. Medical cost trends continue around, in fact, slightly below our expectations, and lost time activity has remained stable. ", "We are encouraged by the reform activity already approved in numerous states and under consideration in many more. These are obviously aggregate marketplace comments, and there are certainly jurisdictions where we see more challenging environment. And accordingly, we are taking the necessary actions in those states. For example, in one state where we are seeing increased losses along with a more difficult legislative environment, we are achieving rate gain significantly above the average for the line, and in the case of Commercial Accounts, well into the mid-teens. ", "We also feel good on the frequency side. But there's more texture underneath the trend, and I want to share with you how we look at it. The graph on Page 12 of the webcast shows our workers' comp frequency for lost time claims from 2006 to the first quarter of 2011. The green curve is actual claims frequency, or more specifically, the fourth quarter rolling average of our reported lost time claims at 12 months. Through 2006 and 2007, the trend was consistent with the long-term average of about a 2% per annum decline in this measure of claim frequency. The dotted blue line on the graph shows a hypothetical trend of reported claims, if we simply extrapolate the historical 2% per annum reduction. ", "With the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008, the actual trend began to diverge from this historical pattern. And by 2009, comp frequency had dropped to levels that were unusually low, and in our opinion even at that time, were not sustainable for the long term. Consequently in the aggregate, we were not pricing new or renewal policies, assuming this unsustainable level of frequency would continue. Off of these lows, we've seen an increase of claim frequency, and it is happening somewhat sooner than we had anticipated. ", "It's important to note that the frequency is still below the extrapolated pre-crisis trend line, which, again, represents a 2% per annum drop in the measure. And while it's early, the most recent data is beginning to point to a flattening. We believe that the movement of frequency trends in the last 3 years have been attributable to the economy. And in that light, recent uptick could actually be evidence of some economic improvement for the classes of business that we insure. So bottom line, although there's been some movement in frequency, it's still at levels that are consistent with long-term improvement. ", "All in, we believe the prospects to the line are sound, but we're not standing on the side lines relative to pricing. In the aggregate, we are driving for rate. And we are encouraged by the fact that our most significant written rate gains in this quarter are in the workers' comp line. ", "Turning to Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment. Operating income was down modestly from the prior-year quarter, reflecting lower net investment income. Underwriting gain saw a slight decrease, which is the net of a few items, primarily more favorable prior-year development offset by an increase in catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather. Excluding cats and prior-year redevelopment, underlying loss margins were consistent year-over-year, while expense dollars were up modestly due to the investments we continue to make in this business. ", "In International, net written premiums were up year-over-year with strong results in Lloyd's, Canada and the U.K., more than offsetting the impact of the termination of an exclusive distribution relationship in Ireland. ", "In both Bond & Financial Products, surety results continue to be impacted by sluggishness in construction spending. We believe we offer a unique value proposition in this business, and we are very satisfied with the margins and the quality of our portfolio. ", "In management liability, we saw significantly improved production results in the quarter and remain satisfied with our overall returns. ", "Finally, we completed the acquisition of our joint venture interest in Brazil, which gives us an ownership position in the market leader of the Brazilian surety business. We're pleased about the opportunity to leverage our leading U.S. surety franchise, as well as our other franchises to expand beyond the surety business into the growing property and casualty markets in Brazil. ", "Moving to Personal Insurance. The weather in the quarter, both catastrophic and non-catastrophic drove the operating loss. Prior-year development for the segment was up year-over-year, driven largely by the favorable development of 2010 cats. Excluding cats and prior-year development, the Personal Insurance combined ratio increased by approximately 5 points quarter-over-quarter. The majority of the increase was driven by adverse non-cat weather losses in Homeowners and even Auto, some of which related to first quarter storms. A smaller financial impact resulted from a higher number of severe fire losses in Homeowners.", "Turning to production results. We had another good quarter with both lines of business posting growth in policies in force and net written premiums. Renewal premium change was up year-over-year in both Auto and Homeowners and other. Retention remains near historic highs for both lines and new business is solid, but down slightly from recent quarters. ", "So in summary, while this quarter was a strong reminder of how the unpredictability of weather can drive results, we remain very positive about the underlying strength of the business. We continue to see some improvements in the market environment, and we believe we are well positioned for success going forward. ", "With that, Jennifer, we'll now open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Mark Gelly [ph] from Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "This is Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. I wanted to touch base on the environmental increase on the reserves, and if that could have any implications for asbestos, given what we saw at the Hartford?", "Jay Benet", "Jay, this is Jay Benet. As it relates to environmental, I would say that look at the environment itself, there really hasn't been a major change in the environment. We experienced the same kind of favorable trends in claim payments that we had been experiencing. As we've said before, we extrapolate information that we have into some formulaic views of what the ultimate loss costs are going to be. And it doesn't take a lot of change in the actual environment to make for some dollar changes in the reserves. So while I would say we saw the same favorable trends, the favorable trends were a little less than we had anticipated in our calculation. So that was the adjustment, nothing major going on. And as it relates to asbestos, we really don't have any comments to make here. I'd say, overall, the environment for asbestos has not changed fundamentally from the way we viewed it last year. And as it relates to where we are, as you know, we do our quarterly procedures on asbestos. The quarterly procedures didn't lead to any kind of change in the reserve. We also do a real detailed overall claim review that we complete annually. We're expecting to complete that in the third quarter. And at that time, we'll see what the asbestos reserves will look.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "And then a separate issue on capital management. Am I right in thinking that the debt-to-capital level is more of a constraint in terms of how much stock Travelers can buy that at this point? If it's 22.5% now debt-to-capital, what's the kind of range that the company is comfortable with?", "Jay Benet", "We generally talk about a range of somewhere between 15% and 25% associated with a AA rating. And one of the things I'd point out about the 22.5%, there's about a point of that, that relates to essentially prefunding some future debt. We took advantage of the low interest rate environment last year to do some retirement of our convertible hybrids that we had. But we also had some excess that we just kept on the balance sheet to be able to use to pay off future debt. So as a result, as it relates to that range, we do have lots of flexibility in the range. And we'll continue to manage the overall capital position with that in mind, with the operating company capital being first and foremost, as well as the liquidity at the holding company, which we've already said many, many times has a target level of about $1.1 billion.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital", "Okay. And I just want to clarify that. So does that mean Travelers is okay, going up to 25% debt-to-cap? Or would that be too high to be at that end of the range?", "Jay Benet", "As far as the rating agencies' discussion, if we did it in a way that took advantage of low interest rates. Well I mean, we have flexibility.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, but I wouldn't -- Jay, this is Jay Fishman. The question, \"Is Travelers okay at 25%?\" implies, or the question may imply that we intend to leverage up for the purpose of buying back more shares. And that's just not how we think about managing our balance sheet where the range, at least, as we understand it, that supports a strong AA rating in our business, which is where we belong, is in that 15% to 25%. We always want to leave some flexibility to deal with unexpected issues. We recognize the kinds of events that we saw this quarter could happen again, and they could happen even worse. And so we don't run our business at the edge. But it's that range that really establishes the notion of that 15% to 25% range, is the range that we understand, is in support of a AA rating.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Matthew Heimermann from JPMorgan.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I guess I just wanted to follow up on the asbestos question. Can you just remind us, because I don't think you report this anywhere anymore, just what survival ratio looks when you adjust for buyouts and settlements?", "Jay Benet", "Not really a statistic I keep at the top of my head because it's not something we think is terribly relevant. We can calculate -- we get it for you though. And we -- the way of looking at it is a good way of looking at it, so taking out the settlement activity, but we just have to get the data.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Yes, that's fair. I just wondered. I can do the raw numbers, but I suspect there's probably a material difference. So I just want to make sure I'm thinking about it correctly. I guess the other question, maybe for Brian is just could you give us a little bit more color on the rate increases by kind of core product line? And I guess I was thinking about maybe how work comp contrast with property, and how that contrasts with maybe general liability and then maybe other specialty liability lines?", "Brian MacLean", "So broadly, as I said, I think, in a couple of spots, the largest increases are in comp. Positive increases everywhere, but consistently, what we in the market have been saying for probably the last year. Property's probably at the tail end of it. So strongest increases in comp.", "Jay Fishman", "When you say property, you're really thinking about Business Insurance.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. It's all about Business Insurance.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes.", "Brian MacLean", "So on the first party's side, and probably over the last couple of years, the larger the account, the more challenging the pricing environment has been. We're seeing improvements everywhere, so we're encouraged that, again, even on the property side, it's gone from negatives to albeit small, but small positives. We're also seeing in the large property world, a little bit of favorable movement on the terms and conditions rhetoric in the marketplace. And so that's very encouraging in that business and held somewhere in between.", "Matthew Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "All right. So if I -- just to restate what you said, if I could kind of think about where comp greater than the 2, pretty much property less than 2, pretty much everything else was probably clustered around the average?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, both , yes.", "Jay Fishman", "As it relates to the survival ratio that you're asking about, x the settlement activity, it's probably close to 8%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "A couple of questions. The first is just a numbers question. In the interest and other segment, as you break it out, the G&A number was quite a bit higher than it had been running. And I'm wondering what's behind that. The second question, you kind of alluded to the fact that, we're obviously dealing with a debt ceiling at this point and there's been obviously some noise about a potential downgrade for U.S. Treasury securities. Have you thought about the implications? Or should that happen, hopefully it doesn't, but should it happen, what it might be for you, specifically maybe annuities might get downgraded as well?", "Jay Fishman", "On the last question, Jay, I -- we don't know. I mean, that's the simple answer. It's unimaginable, right, unthinkable that a sovereign entity that has a printing press in the basement somehow makes a decision to stop printing. We don't -- and so I simply don't know. We don't know the consequences of what a technical default, a partial default or anything else might be. We'll play it out as it comes.", "Jay Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Fair enough, that's my answer too. I have no clue.", "Jay Benet", "As far as what you are seeing in interest in other, from time-to-time, we have some items that will impact that. As a rule, we allocate costs throughout our business segments to minimize the amount of costs that's sitting in the interest and other. So it's got a very low base. In this particular case, there was a legal matter that was settled and it impacted it. But it's a nonrecurring item, and that's as much as we'd like to share about them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Just going back to the discussion on asbestos, one of the other companies recently added to their reserves. And they talked about increase their claim activity against smaller peripheral insurers. Am I understanding this correctly that you are not seeing that trend in your numbers?", "Jay Fishman", "I wouldn't say that at all. I'd say we've been seeing that trend a long time, and our reserves are reflecting that.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "But you are not seeing any comparative adverse trends?", "Jay Fishman", "Not based on what we had expected.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's actually helpful. The only other question I have is on the new business. If I look back over the past 4 quarters, it has trended down. And I'm just wondering, is that a function of your attempt to drive pricing? Or is that a function of competition?", "Brian MacLean", "I would say it's hard for me to separate those a little bit. But certainly as any carrier begins to drive for some rate improvement, you're going to get some reaction in new business levels and you're going to get some reaction in retention levels. So that's what we've seen on the Business Insurance side. And we're very comfortable with the trade-offs that we're seeing there in the activity.", "Jay Fishman", "Why don't you comment on our view of the pricing with new business?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I think that one of the things we are encouraged by directionally is the last quarter, certainly, maybe 2 quarters throughout this year. That environment, we think, has actually improved slightly. And there's always a delta between, as we've talked about a zillion times, a delta between renewal and new pricing. But that is -- that has shrunk over the last couple of quarters. And so directionally, we feel that's moving in the right place.", "Jay Fishman", "We've actually gotten a couple of things going on there. The first is, obviously, as renewal pricing lifts, you're working off a higher base. And then I think importantly, but I wouldn't declare a definitive trend here that's unassailable. But importantly, the spread between new and renewal has narrowed, meaning that the gap between the renewal price and new price was wider. Previously, it's more narrow off a higher number. So Brian's comment about it improving is a complex one and really is impacted by both the level of renewals as well as that spread.", "Brian MacLean", "And I didn't know if you were talking about just BI. But on the Personal Insurance side, we think there's some of the movement there as the economy and slowdown in new auto sales and shopping and home sales. And then some of it is probably a little bit of reaction to our pricing strategy there.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Two questions here. The first one just with respect to workers\u2019 compensation. You made a comment that you were pricing in line with the trend line versus -- extrapolated trend line versus back in '09. I'm curious, do reserving practices follow the same kind of pattern as pricing.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. First...", "Jay Fishman", "We're going to [indiscernible]. Go ahead.", "Brian MacLean", "Two things. One is we were not pricing fully up on the extrapolated trend line either. We were somewhere in between. And what I think any carrier is going to do is they're going to look at changing trends and they've got to decide, \"Do I ignore it? Do I fully incorporated it? Or do I look at someplace in between?\" And we were someplace in between, and I -- probably, my comments didn't make that crystal clear. So we didn't fully incorporate the downturn. And now I've -- from a reserving side, yes, we will reserve and price somewhat differently in that. As we look at trends and as they emerge, we should appropriately reflect the actual trends reserving for the business that's written and the accident years that those losses are coming from. So we more incorporate into our reserving the facts that we see. Obviously, we're coming up with an estimate of what we think the ultimate is going to be out of those.", "Jay Fishman", "With the exception of Brian's comment in his prepared remarks that the lift off the bottom was somewhat faster or sooner. However, one wants to interpret it, then we had originally assumed. We've actually, so far, done a good job of ultimately picking the developed numbers pretty, pretty close. We've had a series of years of favorable development in workers' comp because our assumption about development was actually not that. It was less than that. And with the exception of how fast we assumed that bottoming out would move back, is the only area where we missed a little. And I do think it's actually missed a little. I mean, many of you would disagree with that.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. The other point I'll emphasize, Brian, is, again, the obvious, but that's just frequency. So on the clarity side, we feel pretty good about the trends.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank", "Terrific. And then the other question, Brian, can you just tell a little bit of, obviously, excluding comps, because you've talked about that, just loss trend, what's going on with loss trend in commercial and then maybe even in personal lines, personal auto?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, on the commercial side, there's really been no dramatic change. I would say on the encouraging side, we continue to feel pretty good about what we see out of the tort environment and how that's been progressing. And otherwise, the trends are pretty consistent with what we've been seeing. Greg, why don't you -- on the personal lines side, Greg Toczydlowski.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Sure. Yes, Brian. Similar story on the Personal Insurance side. Good news on the frequency side, pretty much contained our loss cost trend. We see a little bit of pressure on the severity side. And Brian's comment really talked about that this quarter in terms of the non-cat weather driving that. So we don't believe that's an ongoing trend. We believe that's some fluctuations, so we'll continue looking at the business more over a longer term.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. One place where we see a little difference between the commercial and the personal book, quite frankly, is a little bit on the frequency of the auto side. On commercial auto, we are seeing a little pickup in frequency, and that, we think is pretty directly related to a pickup in economic opportunity for our insured base. And we're not seeing it on the personal lines side because we don't think there's pickup in the miles driven on the personal side. So a little bit of a difference there, but small movement.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Just sort of a quick one on workers' comp. I'm sorry to keep hitting this but -- after the changes you made in the first quarter to that book, can you talk about the difference between premium trend and loss trend? And especially given that you've seen that book increased a lot or, at least, written premiums has increased a lot in the second quarter. And I just have one follow-up.", "Jay Fishman", "We're going to resist the temptation to make a declaration and try and compare written rate to earned loss trend. We spent some time yesterday trying to understand that issue with real clarity. And candidly, you make so many assumptions about will written trend continue and will -- I'm sorry, will written rate trend continue? And what will happen to earned loss trend, that we're just going to avoid any predictions about whether written trend is running higher than earned loss trend. And I think the numbers, at least for the moment, speak for themselves. I think what we're comfortable saying, and correct me because I'm -- if you think I'm wrong, is not we're not losing ground. I think that's the important comment. We don't believe -- at least at the moment. That can change next week. That can change next month either way. But we feel pretty good that we're not losing ground. And that's, I think about as far as we want to go in an outlook kind of statement about workers' comp.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Okay, that's very fair. One question on Commercial Accounts, I guess, I imagine a lot of the uptick there is also comp. But you're seeing pricing or you're taking pricing higher competitively on those accounts or just in the business you're writing. What's happening? Is it that others are not following? Or is it that people are taking their rates higher? Any notion on what's causing both a raise in rate and also the opportunity to hold business? And I see you retention, but also pickup new business.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I think it's -- so there's a lot there in your question. We've talked a lot about what we do as a franchise. And we think we've got some real market-leading, distinct competitive advantages in those businesses that, that customers' value and enable us to keep our business and keep it at appropriate rates of return. I'm not sure where the broader market is when -- because I sense a little bit implied in your comment was we're doing distinctly better than the marketplace. I would hope we are. But I don't know exactly what those numbers are.", "William Cunningham", "And just to add to that -- this is Bill Cunningham. I think the other thing you have to keep in mind is we don't approach every account the same. This is not a one-size-fits-all in terms of how we approach each account. We try to be as thoughtful as we can in terms of rate need down to the risk based under the risk characteristics that we're seeing. We manage things differently office-by-office based on what we're seeing. Line approach may vary by state. So it's thoughtful, as weighted as we can be. I think it's having a big difference in terms of [indiscernible].", "Jay Fishman", "I think one of the things that we take for granted that we tend not to speak about in these comments is the risk control approach that we take to workers' comp. It's not an open-to-buy book. It's not that we underwrite any comer that happens to walk into an agent's office. There's an active and engaged risk control process, a substantial engineering group that for virtually every new account in Commercial Accounts -- again, if I'm overstating, correct me. But virtually every new account in Commercial Accounts, we've got our own engineers out in the field, actually observing the risk control practices and procedures of the accounts that we underwrite. And I would speculate, and it is just speculation, that what we're ending up with is a better class of workers\u2019 compensation business from a loss management perspective than carriers who don't bring that level of expertise to the market. And there's an interesting phenomenon to talk about, about what happens to those classes of business and their unemployment statistics and their way of dealing with injuries that's different from the average marketplace. I do think that our risk control organization adds real value here and ends up creating a block of business, a book of business that's just different from lots of other people who write more generally. Not everyone, as there are other people who bring that level of expertise also. But I think relative to those who don't, we end up with a very different managed book of business from a loss perspective.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill.", "J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P.", "I believe, from the presentation we saw at the Analyst Day, that you folks have been having a pretty heavy push into the Midwest in your personalized business. And I'd like to know, given what's happened in the last quarter and we sought that -- a broader sort of secondary question, should we, in general, think of because of the geographic changes in your book, having a larger cat load, overall, in your personalized business?", "Jay Fishman", "A couple of questions there, and I, first, I'm not sure that there've been any geographic changes, in particular, in our book with respect to your last question. I'm going to let Greg speak to the distribution. But to the extent that one concludes that the tornado peril is more prevalent than it was previously, it's a challenge to deal with that from a risk selection and underwriting point of view. It's difficult for us to determine the difference between Charlotte and Atlanta and Dallas and Houston and Joplin and frankly, Springfield, Massachusetts in this last quarter. So as we think about how do we manage this more effectively, it really does come down to rate and terms and conditions a lot more than it comes down to geographic selection, relative to trying to manage the peril differently. It's one thing to manage coastal exposure. We know where the coast is. It's another to try and manage broad-based tornado exposure because it is just so random, it is so random but so intense at the point of storm. So it's a real tough one to deal with from the selection standpoint.", "Brian MacLean", "So, Paul, let me -- this is Brian. Let me take a shot at I think addressing the broad question you're asking, which is, is our exposure going up here? Is our estimate of cat activity going up? Then I'm going to throw it to Greg on the specific on the geography. I think it's fair to say for every underwriter in this industry, while looking at RMS 11 and looking at the wind hail activity for the last couple of years actually, but certainly, this year in particular, we're looking at higher rather than lower. But we're still in the middle of evaluating that whole process. But it's not fundamentally driven by our geographic shift. It's driven by the obvious concerns with the changes in the weather patterns and how we impact that -- I mean integrate that. So Greg, if can you talk about geography? It moved a little.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Sure, yes. We've -- I think we've talked in the past about our agency expansion strategy. And we have had a disproportionate amount of new agents coming in the Midwest and West just because of our heavy penetration in the Northeast. So I think that's some of the data that we have shared with you. We've been trying to respond to a lot of the rhetoric in the marketplace. Is this a new normal for weather? And we just got to go back a couple of years in 2006, 2007 when there was relatively no catastrophes in the marketplace over those 24 months. And we certainly -- the marketplace wasn't saying that's a new trend at that time also. So we're certainly not in the business of guessing what the weather is going to be in the future. We're being very disciplined and focused around our pricing in terms of [indiscernible] and I feel very comfortable around our footprint.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore Partners.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Two questions, the first one was on workers\u2019 compensation. I was curious whether some of the adverse prior quarter reserve development came from workers\u2019 compensation?", "Jay Benet", "Just in looking at the overall line, there was no adverse development for workers' comp this quarter.", "Jay Fishman", "Prior year.", "Jay Benet", "Yes, prior year than this.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "In the prior and prior quarter. Okay, great. The second question is...", "Jay Fishman", "No, no, no. That's the prior year. Yes, yes.", "Jay Benet", "No, no, no. Let me just -- because everything before January 1 of this year, in any given quarter, we're doing full analysis of what our reserve needs are. There's always going to be some prior years, we're going to up a little bit, some will go down a little bit. But net-net, there was no prior year development of any magnitude for workers' comp.", "Jay Fishman", "But Brian did say in his comments, because again your question, I thought, was quarter-to-quarter.", "Jay Benet", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "Some of the re-estimation of the...", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Across the year, yes.", "Jay Fishman", "Some of it was due to the winter storms, and to a lesser extent, workers' comp. What underlies that is a projected increase in the current year loss ratio for comps driven by this movement coming back to trend line faster than we had anticipated. So there was the impact in the second quarter. These, by the way, relative to a company of our size, are relatively small numbers. But what you -- what did was we upped the loss ratio of some a little bit.", "Jay Benet", "For the current year, right.", "Jay Fishman", "For the current year. And we obviously had a catch-up in the second quarter relative to the first quarter re-estimation. Mike, did I answer it [ph] right?", "Michael Klein", "Okay.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Fair enough, understood. The second question is on Homeowners. You are taking up rates 9%. Just curious as to what reception you're getting from the regulators, as well as your customers on the rate increases.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Yes. This is Greg again. We're, as you see, we've had 9% for 2 consecutive quarters. And currently, we live in a regulatory environment, and so we need to get those approved, either file a news [ph] or prior to approval. And we've got very good relationships with the regulators and our distributors. And there are always cost-based reasons around why we get the rate level, and we've been successful in implementing those. So we obviously are seeing the results around that particular product line in this quarter and believe they're warranted. And we'll continue to watch that and be prudent with the rate going forward.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "Sure. I was just curious as to why you're not seeing sort of a drop-off in the retention ratios in Homeowners because of rate increases? Would that be because most competitors are taking rates also by some of the levels?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Yes. We clearly are operating as a function of the market and we're not the only one feeling these catastrophe losses over the last 2 years. So there clearly is an increase in rate environment on the property side. We watch the marketplace quite a bit in terms of the amount of filings that come through, increases, the decreases and the simple ratio. And it's close to a double-digit ratio right now, what the marketplace is doing in that particular line. So clearly we're not the only one taking some rate in that particular product.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "You mentioned exposure growth in the Business Insurance is moving positive. How big of an impact are payrolls on exposures increasing?", "Brian MacLean", "In comps, it's the whole game. So it's a -- but the biggest driver in our overall results would be GL, which is fundamentally driven by sales and receipts, business receipts. That's the biggest driver. But you can look at our book and you can look at the relationship of comp. And so payrolls have been moving up and are certainly a piece of that.", "Jay Fishman", "Projected payrolls.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "Exposure is a projected number that our insureds provide us at renewal.", "Brian MacLean", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "And then obviously, it gets trued out at audit premium time down the road in the middle market. And so what we're seeing is it's actually there are 2 manifestations of a better environment. First is that insureds are perceiving the environment better, meaning they're anticipating some payroll growth. And then what we're actually seeing in the audit premium numbers in the aggregate. I don't know how the audit premium relates down narrowly to workers comp. But what we're seeing in the audit premium is that in fact, the activity that our insureds, economic activity, ratable activity that they're experiencing over the policy period, is turning out now to be more than they had originally anticipated. So there's 2 elements to it. They're both worth thinking about.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C.", "Great, that's helpful. And also in Business Insurance, very positive that you're getting rate on the renewal book of business. Is it a several year gradual process to get rates where you want?", "Jay Fishman", "Actually, it's a very good question and I'll ask Bill to chime in as well. We -- the history on this is that we wrestled for a long time as to how to respond to the precipitous decline in investment rates, which obviously form an important part of the profitability of our business. And when investment rates fell in connection with the prices, it obviously impacted the profitability prospectively of the business that we were writing. The notion that we would have a knee-jerk reaction and attempt to increase prices precipitously, dramatically, never really occurred to us. We always have a mindset about making sure our agents are comfortable with understanding what we're doing and why. And that our insureds understand what we're doing and why. And importantly, we weren't smart enough to know when the investment market would return to more normal levels. And as I commented last quarter, we're beginning to contemplate the notion that the investment environment that we're in may indeed be longer rather than shorter. That obviously back in the third quarter, I think, of last year set us on a path of trying to get rate on a measured basis, not -- being mindful of not disrupting agents' business and certainly not disrupting insureds business. But to do so thoughtfully. If you've got a $100,000 account and you got a 2% rate increase, it's $102,000 premium. And hopefully, we bring value enough to both the agent and the insured that, that's a transaction that we can be delivered to the insured without great concern. So far, so good. But it is so far. And I would answer your question just saying, yes, we think about this as a multiyear effort. It's not -- our strategy in the pricing environment remains intact, driven to a great extent by the declining -- by the reduction in investment rates available and just thinking about the aggregate returns in our business. Now having said that, we balance that out against the notion that cost of equity has dropped dramatically over the last 3 or 4 years for most good companies, anyway. We put up a slide in the Investor Day that showed our historical cost of equity. And then we got into an interesting question of, what happens to the long-term cost of equity? Does it stay down at the levels that they're at, that it's at? And therefore, what levels of returns are going to be available in the marketplace before our competitors step in? And so those are all of the variables that we're wrestling with. The conclusion of all of that, though, is to move for rate gains on a measured basis, thoughtfully, not disruptively. Any of those concerns are dealt with by a measured pace of getting rate gains.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Josh Shanker from Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "On the charts that you showed about renewal rate change, I'm just -- given the fact there was unfavorable development on 1Q 11, does that change your prior opinions on renewal change? Or is that an absolute number or based on loss cost trends?", "Jay Fishman", "The renewal rate change is a pure rate number. And I'm looking over at Bill and Fred Donner, a pure rate number calculated at the time of renewal. And so it's independent of loss cost trend. If we had a policy that was $100,000 and it's renewing with exactly the same exposure and exactly the same terms and conditions, and we do our best to analyze them at this level, and it's renewing at the $102,000, that's a 2% rate gain. And so it's calculated, it's expiring premium relative to renewal premium. And it's independent of any loss trend analysis or re-estimation of loss rates.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay, then. Can you comment, in general, on where you see your current growth relative to the rate of loss growth?", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, I commented on that before. We're going to resist the temptation to make predictions or estimations about whether the rate gains that we're getting, once they are earned, will then offset the loss trend that we are experiencing at that point in time. What we're pretty comfortable saying at the moment is that we're not losing ground. We're not losing ground. There is a comment, as there always is, in the Outlook section of the 10-Q that we filed earlier today, that speaks to what we expect underwriting margins to be. Now remember, that's earned. What's in the 10-Q is purely earned. So it has nothing to do, obviously, has something to do. But it's not a direct function of written rate gains right now. But there is a comment in the Q about what we anticipate underwriting margins to be. But the rate change moves each quarter. The loss trend moves each quarter. And so any predictions that we make are going to force us to constantly go back and revisit whether we were right or wrong. And we're going to just resist the temptation.", "Brian MacLean", "In my comments, I said that if we look at underlying Business Insurance margins on a year-to-date basis, they are about where we expected. There's always little movements. But we're talking real little movements here. So rate might be a little bit better than we expected. Loss trend might be slightly worse. But it's netting out to about where we thought.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And are there any other unusual items besides the catastrophes in the auto combined ratio number? Or it was somewhat higher this quarter?", "Jay Benet", "It was really all weather-related, either catastrophe or non-catastrophe had a weather impact on it.", "Jay Fishman", "Partly, just to reinforce that, it's -- I do want to say it's unusual. But most people don't think about the fact that a hailstorm that doesn't qualify as a cat, could, in fact, generate auto losses. So a small hailstorm can, in fact, produce non-cat weather Auto losses. And we've had experiences in this quarter of non-cat weather producing auto losses.", "Joshua Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG", "And can you reiterate your threshold on what's the -- where weather then becomes a cat?", "Jay Fishman", "I don't believe we...", "Jay Benet", "Yes, we've never...", "Jay Fishman", "We've never -- I don't believe that we've disclosed that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Larry Greenberg from Langen McAlenney.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "I'm just wondering if you might be able to talk qualitatively about Business Insurance reserve development, which is positive, but down from prior-period levels. And I know the environmental was a portion of that. But I guess more specifically, I'm wondering if workers' comp might be playing a pretty significant role in that, given that the trend line was favorable for a while. Now you're saying that it's -- loss trend is moving up a bit more rapidly. Is that a meaningful piece of the lower favorable development? And maybe anything else you might be able to add on that front.", "Jay Benet", "First of all, I'd go back to what we were saying earlier. We look at our reserves in a very full-some way each quarter. And we evaluate movements and the net result of it is what you see this quarter. I wouldn't read too much into it in relation to their level this quarter versus prior quarters. As it relates specifically to things like workers' comp or general liability or the other components that make it up, if you go back and read through our quarterly 10-Qs, which I'm not urging you to do. But if you did it, you would see that each quarter, there are different elements contributing to the net favorable development. So it's not like you look at workers' comp this quarter versus last quarter versus the fourth quarter versus the first quarter this year. You're going to see any kind of pattern, that say, one particular line has been favorable, favorable, favorable and suddenly it's not. It's a process that we go through that just looks at what's developing in the data. And we make adjustments when the data suggests we should be making the adjustments.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Greg Locraft from Morgan Stanley.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from the line of Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets.", "Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "A lot of my questions have already been asked and answered. But the one topic I wanted to touch on briefly, in both the rate and the volume environment on commercial, are you seeing any big disparity between relatively large accounts, mid-sized accounts and small accounts? We've heard a lot of commentary from brokers that there's that type of a divergence.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, and the answer is yes, but nothing new in that regard. These are comments you can go back over the last several years, and you'll see us saying the same thing. The smaller account business has been less subject to rate volatility than the larger account business, and the middle market business falls right in between. What I always try to reinforce to people, because I do think that there's any number of folks who kind of misperceive us, what it is we do, we are not broadly speaking a large account casualty writer in particular. We are a small and middle market company that comprises a substantial percentage of our Business Insurance business to the extent we do business with large accounts, it really falls into 2 areas. One is National Property, where as a result of our reinsurance programs, our actual net exposure is not what one would think of relative to kind of large accounts. And then we do fee-for-service business in our National Accounts business, where we're handling claims, workers' comp claims for a fee. And the nature of the risk -- it's not guaranteed costs. It's loss-sensitive business, has a very different characteristic. But most certainly, when you look at our middle market business, which is larger obviously, that our small commercial business, you do we see a more price competitive environment and as we watch broadly speaking into the large account arena, which, again, we don't participate in a dramatic way, in a meaningful way, it is indeed more competitive at that end as well.", "Mark Dwelle - RBC Capital Markets, LLC", "So that's probably the best explanation as to why the National Accounts' premiums would be, I'll say, the weakest amongst those 3, whereas, the Commercial Accounts segment would really be the strongest and amongst those 3.", "William Cunningham", "Yes, but part of it, but be careful to read into that because as you look at the loss response of -- this is Bill Cunningham, that's also a function of a losses under management and largely workers\u2019 compensation. So over the course of the last year as frequency has dropped and the overall losses have dropped, as we look at those renewals prospectively, that has an impact on the premium we charge and the fee that we charge.", "Jay Fishman", "I wouldn't leap into the conclusion because it's a complicated answer that our National Accounts business, to the extent it shows up as premiums, a lot of its guaranteed costs that's showing up as premiums. And it's not subject to the -- what's the premium basis. Bill is expressing that as the loss content is projected to go down, so do our premiums. They go right along with it. But by definition, the profit margin on that business may not go down in the same way. So the nature of our National Accounts business is such that it wouldn't make a lot of sense. It's not guaranteed costs and it would be -- it's just the -- you get the incorrect assumptions. So look at our National Accounts business at the changes and perceive that it's a function of the competitive environment. There are carriers that have real expertise in dealing with large accounts. And we're just not one of them. And I'm speaking on a guaranteed cost basis. It's just not what we do.", "Operator", "And our last question is from the line of the Ian Gutterman with Adage Capital.", "Ian Gutterman - Adage Capital", "I'll be brief. I just had one quick question on Commercial Accounts. I'm trying to understand, but it seems there's some can contrasting trends there. I was hoping to get some insights. The retention pressures seem greatest in that line. And I'm guessing maybe part of that was through the rate increases, and at the same time, your new business is probably one of the better lines there. And the premium growth was obviously very strong, up double digits. So can you help me understand why retention will be getting worse at the same time, new business and overall premiums will be getting better?", "Jay Fishman", "I -- your statement is factually correct, but the interpretation is a little off, Ian. We -- the fact is retention in the second quarter of 2011 was 84%. From a historical perspective, that's extraordinarily strong. We were coming off levels of 86% and 87% in the second and third quarters of last year, which is candidly one of the factors that led us to conclude that there might be opportunities to gain rate while still improving the overall quality and profitability of the business that we do. So you're right, it's dropped from 87% or 86% in the second quarter of this year to 84%. But that's still at levels that are solid, strong, great, terrific whatever you want -- which one to put on it. And so at the moment while it's dropped the tiniest bit, we don't perceive it at the moment, unless you see it differently than I do, that we've taken a meaningful dip in retention relative to what long-term profits -- relative to the way where we've managed the business to produce returns.", "William Cunningham", "On the growth side of the question, there's a number of things playing through there. First, in addition to having continued strong retention, you've got the impact of exposure being positive on renewals. But you've also got the audit additional premium coming through those numbers as well.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes.", "William Cunningham", "And then their rates. So you've got rate gain, exposure gain at renewal, positive audit premiums and those are the factors playing through this that are impacting the growth.", "Jay Benet", "And the positive audit premium compared to negative audit premium last year. So that's going to have an impact on that percentage growth.", "Jay Fishman", "Your question is still a thoughtful and substantive one. We will always watch this as we go down this path slowly, thoughtfully. Hopefully, our concept is that we can execute this without trading off substantial amounts of retention. If, in fact, we overshoot and retention drops in a precipitous rate, we'll obviously re-evaluate our view about how we're approaching pricing. But the question's right. I think you just have to put it into a historical perspective to look at it and say, still on track.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back to you, Ms. Nawi. Please go ahead.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Thank you for your -- all, for joining us today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Wednesday, October 19, 2011. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Sussie. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation, and then we will open it for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. And good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "You, of course, all know that this was another quarter marked by significant weather. In that context, our business is strong enough to have produced $332 million in operating income and an operating return on equity of 5.9%. For the full year, we're at $781 million of operating income and an operating return on equity of 4.5%. While this year has certainly placed considerable demands on our claim department, we're very pleased that our claim teams were prepared and positioned to customers with first-rate speed. I also couldn't be more pleased with our catastrophe claim management strategy upon which we embarked in 2005.", "Our ability to respond to claimants with almost entirely internal staffs sets us apart from many other insurance companies and allows us to process claims more effectively and efficiently, as well as with a higher level of customer satisfaction. ", "Turning to our operations, our strategy is quite focused. We are seeking improved pricing, as well as improved terms and conditions on the insurance products we sell. We are doing so not only because interest rates may remain low for some time, but also given the possibility that the more active weather patterns, such as we have experienced over the last few years, may continue.", "And the progress we are making pursuing the strategy is already evident in our Business Insurance segment. In the quarter, we achieved pricing gains across all product lines, led by workers compensation and property. The overall pure renewal rate gain in the quarter for Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, was just over 3% and just over 4% for the month of September, demonstrating our success in driving rate improvement.", "And while we are prepared to trade volume for improve margins and profitability, retention remains at strong levels and forms a basis for our optimism that we can continue to improve pricing in our Business Insurance segment.", "In that regard, we are particularly pleased with our results in our middle market businesses, and Brian will have more to say about that later. We also note that exposure in our Business Insurance segment remains positive and continues to improve. In addition, audit premiums have also turned meaningfully positive. The combination of higher exposure in auto premiums, as well as improved rate are important factors, which allowed us to generate a significant 7% growth in net written premiums in Business Insurance this quarter.", "While our strategy is the same in Personal Insurance, our renewal premium change for property has been in the 8% to 9% range for some time, and our renewal premium change for auto has been in the 3% to 4% range. And the regulatory environment is such that it will take some time before our more recent actions will show in our results.", "With respect to capital management, we repurchased $375 million of stock in the quarter, and our guidance with respect to targeted fourth quarter repurchases is considerably higher. Jay Benet will share that with you during his comments.", "Finally, we're also pleased that Standard & Poor's upgraded our financial strength ratings to AA, although we are not reliant on the commercial paper market to fund our operations, our short-term ratings are now A1/P1. In summary, the weather was again challenging, but we remain bullish on our ability to deliver rate improvements and superior returns over time.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks, Jay. There are a few things I'd like to discuss with you this morning, so let me start with the weather. Third quarter catastrophe losses, which were driven by Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee, with $394 million after-tax, much higher than what we were consider \"normal\" and more than 5x our cap losses in last year's third quarter.", "Losses related to Hurricane Irene were $253 million after-tax. It represented only 1% of shareholders' equity. The losses from Tropical Storm Lee was $74 million after tax. The cats were not the only weather story in the quarter. As Brian will discuss later, both Business Insurance and Personal Insurance experienced significantly higher levels of non-cat weather-related losses that, when combined with the expected impact of earned pricing and loss cost trends, drove a 4.5 point quarter-over-quarter increase in our consolidated GAAP combined ratio, ex-cats and prior-year development.", "Turning to reserves, third quarter's total net favorable prior-year reserve development was $124 million after tax, down a bit from $147 million after tax in the prior-year quarter. Once again, all 3 of our business segments experienced net favorable prior-year reserve development as a result of better than expected loss experience.", "Within Business Insurance, reserve development included a $114 million after-tax increase to our asbestos reserves. While the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged, recent payment trends have been moderately higher than we had previously anticipated. I'd also point out that this year's asbestos reserve increase was actually less than last year's increase on a gross basis. You will recall that last year, the asbestos reserve increase was net of a reduction in the uncollectible reinsurance reserve of $70 million or $45 million after tax, that resulted from a favorable ruling related to a reinsurance dispute.", "Page 7 of the webcast summarizes our holdings of sovereign debt securities issued by Eurozone countries that are considered troubled: Spain, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Portugal, amounting to only $8 million as of the end of the quarter. The schedule also shows our holdings of all securities issued by banks, insurance companies, finance and leasing companies and brokers and asset managers in these troubled countries, consisting of debt and nonredeemable preferred stock. These holdings amounted to only $16 million as of the end of the quarter.", "Lastly, the schedule shows our holdings of securities issued by other Eurozone financial institutions where the securities are not guaranteed by the sovereign country. In total, all of these Eurozone holdings represent only a tiny fraction of our $73.7 billion investment portfolio.", "While our analysis of the RMS version 11 hurricane model update remains a work in process, we do have some preliminary observations we would like to share with you this morning, all of course, subject to the completion of our works. Based upon our evaluation of RMS 11 and other hurricane models that we use in combination with our own expensive data, we currently believe that we will be increasing our expected hurricane average annual loss, or AAL, as well as our expected hurricane probable maximum loss, or PML. This is one of the reasons that our strategy is focused on pricing and terms and conditions. Notwithstanding these expected increases on our hurricane AAL and PML, we currently expect our total catastrophe exposure adjusted for RMS 11 will remain within our targeted equity impact range as contemplated by our existing capital structure and that, as a result, we are not expecting to increase our target capital levels, significantly reduce our exposures, or purchase additional reinsurance as a result of RMS 11.", "I'll remind you, this analysis is still a work in progress so these observations are preliminary.", "Lastly, let me mention a few key numbers. Operating cash flow was very strong this quarter at $917 million, despite the large spike in claim costs due to weather. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity in U.S. dollars that are in the United States and therefore, not subject to tax on repatriation of $2.4 billion. Net unrealized investment gains increased to $4 billion pre-tax or $2.6 billion after tax, and book value per share rose to $60.98 at the end of the quarter, a 4% increase since the beginning of the year.", "And consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $375 million of common stock and paid $173 million in dividends, bringing year-to-date common stock repurchases to $1.7 billion and year-to-date dividends of $503 million. Based upon our current liquidity position and our expectations for fourth quarter operating income, which as always, does not include any provision for reserve development and subject to other needs that may arise, such as contribution to our qualified pension plan, which we currently do not expect to have to make. We are targeting fourth quarter common stock repurchases at approximately $1 billion.", "And with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. As we just mentioned, our third quarter earnings were meaningfully impacted by the catastrophic weather events listed on Slide 4 of the webcast, as well as an above-average amount of non-catastrophic weather.", "Excluding the impact of weather and prior year development, we continue to see margins that were essentially in line with our expectations. The other important part of our story this quarter was the strong increases in pricing that we continued to achieve broadly across our businesses. This is especially true in Business Insurance, where net written premiums were up 7% year-over-year, driven by double-digit increases in our Commercial Accounts and industry-focused businesses. The overall increase in net written premiums included renewal premium change of 5%, of which pure rate accounted for over 3%. This marks the third consecutive quarter of positive rate increases in Business Insurance and in fact, these are the largest rate gain since the Travelers-St. Paul merger in 2004.", "In addition, we are achieving the rate gains broadly with increases in all product lines for the second consecutive quarter. The workers compensation line had the highest level of rate increase, and the property lines showed the most significant improvement over last quarter. As you can see on Slide 14, the pace of rate increases, both in Commercial Accounts and in the segment as a whole, continued to accelerate as we ended the third quarter, with segment rate at 4% and Commercial Accounts at 6% for the month of September.", "Importantly, we believe that these written rate levels exceed our current view of lost trend. I know this is only one month, but after speaking to you about margin compression for the last several years, we believe this is significant. And based on our preliminary view, we believe we are making further progress in October.", "In addition to the rate gains, our top line benefited from our customers purchasing more insurance. Exposure was up about 2% this quarter, and audit premiums were up meaningfully, both year-over-year and in sequential quarters. Retention remains solid, while new business is down slightly from the same period last year. Along with our renewal pricing strategy, we are also achieving better pricing on our new business. And although this may have an impact on new business volume going forward, we are comfortable with that trade-off.", "Turning to third quarter operating earnings. In addition to the significantly higher catastrophe losses and less favorable prior-year development versus the third quarter of 2010, results have been negatively impacted by some non-recurring items, primarily the non-catastrophe weather largely in the property lines. Last quarter, we provided you with an update on our workers compensation loss trends, specifically noting a modest uptick in frequency. Through this quarter, overall loss trend has remained stable, and frequency is performing as we expected. As always, we continue to manage this line closely on a state-by-state basis.", "So we continue to feel good about the underlying performance of this business and are extremely pleased with the rate gains that we've achieved and in particular, the pricing momentum that occurred in the latter part of the quarter. ", "In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, operating income of $211 million was strong and consistent with strong operating income in the prior-year quarter. The current quarter's underwriting gain was up modestly due to favorable prior-year development. The 3.2 points of deterioration in the adjusted combined ratio is due to the impact of lower levels of earned premium and unusually low level of what we define as large losses in the prior-year quarter and an increase in infrastructure investment to support growth in the International business.", "For the first time since the first quarter of 2009, our management liability business and Bond & Financial Products experienced growth on a production basis. And excluding the impact of a personal lines distribution arrangement in Ireland that we terminated last year, the International business also grew on a production basis for the first time since the first quarter of 2010.", "In both cases, this is the continuation of a positive trend going back several quarters, and we believe is the result of IT investments and other strategic efforts.", "Surety volume continues to be down, reflecting sluggishness in construction spending and underwriting selection. ", "Moving to Personal Insurance, extraordinary weather events, both catastrophic and non-catastrophic, continue to adversely impact our financials and drove an operating loss for the quarter. Net favorable prior-year development for the segment was somewhat less than the third quarter of 2010.", "Excluding cats and prior-year development, the Personal Insurance combined ratio increased approximately 3 points quarter-over-quarter in both Homeowners, as well as Auto. The majority of this increase was driven by adverse non-cat weather. Certainly, we're not going to try and predict the weather, but by incorporating the last 2 years of actual experience into our long-term averages, our expectation of weather losses in this business has increased. In response, we will be driving for additional rate increases, as well as adjusting terms and conditions and looking for higher deductibles.", "Turning to the production results, both lines of business posted year-over-year growth in policies in force this quarter, while net written premiums were up 3% in Agency Homeowner and down slightly for Agency Auto. Renewal premium change and retention were strong in both Auto and Home, while new business volume was down from the same period last year.", "We expect new business volumes may decline modestly going forward, as we continue a disciplined execution on our pricing strategy. As in Business Insurance, this is a trade-off that we are comfortable making.", "Now before we go to Q&A, I'll turn it back to Jay Fishman for a comment.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Brian. I just want to take 15 seconds to acknowledge an important anniversary, our much appreciated and much loved partner, Bill Heyman, is celebrating his 20th anniversary with the company. And consistent with Travelers' expense-minded culture, I'm handing him his inexpensive and cheap Lucite plaque. No watches here, but I can't think of a better place to acknowledge 20 years, Bill, than in front of the people for whom you've been working all this time and doing such a terrific job. Congratulations.", "William H. Heyman", "I have no idea. Thank you.", "Jay S. Fishman", "With that, operator, we're going to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question, coming from the line of Mike Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on workers comp. Obviously, you saw some -- a lot of premium growth in the quarter that's been a trend this year. Can you talk a little bit about pricing versus loss trend there? And kind of what is the geographic breakdown of that business and any problem states, or states where you're seeing loss trend increase in what you're doing there?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Mike, this is Brian. I'll take a shot at some high level comments, and then throw it to Bill Cunningham and I'll probably preface all of this with were not going to get to granularity into talking about a specific state or market. As we said in the comments, we feel comp pricing has been moving. It started moving before the other lines of business. And we continue to see some decent increases there. So we feel good about where we are pricing versus loss trend broadly in that business. We spent a good bit of time on last quarter's call talking about what was in the end of the day, a pretty little movement in frequency, but we wanted to break it out. So the loss trend continues to move as we discussed then.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Which importantly, just to interrupt, if you remember the conversation last quarter, it was that we were moving back to the previously anticipated trend line just a little bit faster than we had expected. So that trend line remains intact, So there's no subsequent issue or problem or change with respect to the workers comp loss relative to our conversation last quarter.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So important, when you look at just premium change, though, and this is true of comp and all of the commercial businesses, what's really driving it is 3 things: The rate component, and really, in this order: Rate, audit premium and exposure growth. And so it's not like we're adding a ton of market share here. We're looking at moving pricing and getting better pricing for the risks we're taking. The other thing I'll say and then throw it to Bill is not only is it a state-by-state, but it's business-by-business. So we have a kind of a different view of small comp versus middle market comp versus large comp. We're always trying to balance all of those.", "William E. Cunningham", "And just a few things to add. First, and I don't know if mentioned payrolls, payrolls are up.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, which is what's driving the exposure in the Auto premium.", "William E. Cunningham", "Right, and I guess, again, not getting into specific geographies, for competitive reasons, what I will tell you is that there are wide ranges of rate change that we're gaining, and it depends on our view of a given state. So the overall rate gain for the line continues to move in more dramatically in the states where we need it. And we see a loss trend dynamic. As we said last quarter, we reflected in our pricing, in our reserving that uptick. And as we look at loss trend and rate gain, we talk about being in front of loss trend projections comp based on our pricing today. And I think we were there sooner on that line and the gap between rate and lost from that line is actually wider than the all lines average.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And just to clarify my comments to make sure we don't confuse anybody. In the second quarter, we increased -- lost pick for workers comp overall to reflect that acceleration into the trend line. That loss estimate is the same one we used for the third quarter, mix adjusted and everything else. But we didn't go back. It currently is at the level that we  reestablished it in the second quarter.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just on the Travelers Select, I mean, obviously, commercial line is up a lot. I mean, is that a reflection of pushing your systems into larger policy sizes, whether it's Select or Select Express? I was just curious to see a big lift in commercial line, and I imagine a lot of that is comp. But the Select was flat. Is that a result of maybe to Brian's comment that pricing is up higher maybe than others?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I apologize, Mike. I'm not getting the question of that was that I know of.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, it's just that Select as a platform and new business was flat, or premiums were flat whereas commercial lines were higher.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, okay. The basic dynamic that's going on there as we've talked about in Select, Select Express is the smaller end. What we call Plus is the larger end. The Plus market, the larger account market is in aggregate down for us and one that we're pushing harder in from a pricing perspective. So that's what would be fundamentally driving that.", "Jay S. Fishman", "The returns, if one breaks Select in 2, it's 2 pieces, Select Express, the lower end Select Plus, the upper end. The returns in the Select Plus business have not been at levels that we feel comfortable just sitting on. And that's partially because we're competing in that segment with smaller, more regional companies who view the upper end of Select as their middle market. So it tends to be a segment of the business that attracts a fair amount of competition. The pricing dynamics there had been a little more difficult, relative to a lower end, more difficult. And so we set our standards and whatever happens to the volume happens. And if we shrink, we shrink; and if we're flat, we're flat, it's okay, as long as the business that we're pricing is being priced at a level that we're prepared to take on and live with. Is that fair?", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My first question is more broad. It has to do with the P&C cycle. Jay Fishman, are you calling for a broad cycle turn here? I mean, you're talking about price increases in Business Insurance in particular, now in excess of loss cost and positive territory for 3 quarters in a row. Is that what you're calling for here?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, sir. In fact, if you go through the comments here today, you won't actually hear the words market or market cycle in anybody's commentary. We decided a year ago -- as I've said, and you've heard us speak about this in other meetings and in our investor days. We're much more skeptical that the amplitude of the cyclicality that many of us grew up in, in this business remains. For a whole host of substances systemic reasons, we just don't think it exists in the same way anymore. And we made the decision a year ago, if you recall, that regardless of whether a red light went on somewhere that was going to declare a cycle turn that we were going to attempt to take our destiny in our own hands and move our own pricing. And whatever happened would happen. We were very encouraged as following the second quarter last year, the results were moving in very much the right direction. We were never nearly as negative as the surveys would've suggested. We shared that data with you. But we made progress. And went from, broadly speaking, negative to positive. Following the weather this year, we decided after the second quarter to further accelerate our own efforts. And so I'm not viewing what anybody else is doing. I'm not declaring any change or turn, absolutely not. I'm just telling you what we're doing. This is active, not passive. We're not reacting to the marketplace. We're just deciding for ourselves what we're going to do in the way we're going to price the product. And we'll see what happens.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "That makes sense. And then for Jay Benet, 2 other ones. First, looking in the 10-Q in terms of the pace of the buyback for 2012, it says Travelers does not expect that we'll continue to repurchase shares in excess of its operating income in 2012. So does that mean it could potentially be less than the operating income that's generated next year? And second, why the shift, especially given $1 billion share buyback pace potentially in 4Q?", "Jay S. Benet", "As you've heard us say before, we've been generating excess capital, we've been returning the capital to our shareholders. We had built up excess capital. We've been operating, as I mentioned during the Barclays conference, in ways to free up capital on the balance sheet, either through reinsurance collections or changes in reserves that have taken place over time or looking at other things. So I mean, eventually, you get to the point where you return the excess capital to your shareholders, and then what you're doing through your operating earnings is creating more capital, evaluating how much of that capital that you're creating through earnings you need to run the business and then from that returning the excess, if you will, to your shareholders, either through dividends or through buyback. So we think we're getting close to that inflection point where the excess is actually being or will have been returned, and we'll be dealing with the creation of new excess through the earnings.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Jay, last one. The impact of DAC accounting changes in 2012, any potential write-down for Travelers?", "Jay S. Benet", "Actually, I think if you look at the new rules closely, you'll see that the new rules really paralleled what we've been doing, so there's not going to be any impact from those new rules for us.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So big impact for the life companies but not for PNC or Travelers.", "Jay S. Benet", "Certainly not for us. I mean, our DAC policy has been to DAC commissions and premium taxes essentially and nothing else. So that coincides with the rules.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "In responding to Jay's question, you said that by the year ago, you decided to take destiny into your own hands and you've seeing favorable results. You're talking about 3 consecutive quarters here of improving renewal rate trend. But also over that same period of time, I'm seeing on running margins deteriorate and it's accelerated. Excluding cats and reserve development, this insurance ratios were up 4 quarters go 100 basis points, 200 basis points, 300 basis points, and then this quarter, it's up year-over-year 700 basis points. I'm seeing a disconnect there. I realize one is earned premium and one is written premium. But it's been going on for a little while here. Can you sort of walk me through what's going on here?", "Jay S. Benet", "Sure. Well, first, your first point is exactly correct. There's an enormous difference between earned and written. And the rate gains reflect themselves in written premiums and obviously will be earned, respectively. The comment in the press release that we issued this morning was important relative to in Brian's comments as well. The fact that we were now at a point where if, in fact, these written rate gains continue, that they exceed our current view of loss trend. So that's the first, written versus earned.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Well, let me just say, a year ago, you said rates were flat and now we have 700 basis points of deterioration from stuff you wrote a year ago. Is that a wrong way to...", "Jay S. Benet", "The numbers are public. My recollection is that overall rate in the second quarter of last year was still actually modestly negative. Loss trend obviously was positive, and we shared with all of you, you included, that we were anticipating margin compression. We were very clear, very transparent at the end of last year and into this year that we were anticipating, projecting and shared with you, in fact, even we were giving guidance the magnitude of the margin compression that we were expecting. And that was driven by the fact that underlying loss trend was running at a higher rate than the -- and at that point, the negative rate that we were achieving. It wasn't substantially negative, but negative is nonetheless negative. And we made progress in moving that price, moving the rate up, but it wasn't -- it isn't until just recently, it wasn't until just recently that the numbers are such that the written rate gains now are projected to exceed current view of loss trend. We've never said that before. You can go back to all the transcripts and you can check. When asked, the closest I think we ever got was that we were saying it was getting close to a push. That was about as close as we got to talking about changing margins. And the last piece, and particularly in this quarter, the most important is non-cat weather. It plays a substantive role in our quarter-to-quarter margins and in our estimates of combined ratios. What I can share with you is this. When you look at the underlying combined ratio now for every business segment that we are, and I'm saying this exclusive of whatever catastrophe load each of us would think is appropriate, but every single one of those segments for the 9 months, for the year-to-date, has a run rate combined ratio of under 100%, some a little more, then some others a little less. But I think that what we've been sharing with everyone about what we were expecting in rate gains and loss trend is the most transparent in the business. And I don't quite see the disconnect. I think we've been very clear about where rate gains and loss trends have been moving.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Can you give a little detail on you said non-cat weather. How much were the percent of the combined ratio do you think non-cat weather has been running over the past few quarters compared to where it used to be?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Josh, so this is Brian. I'd stepped from -- because you can pick a part that combined ratios by quarter and look at a whole bunch of different things. But if you look at our year-to-date in Business Insurance combined ratio and the ex-cat, ex-PYD number of 98.2, I would say knock about a point off of that and you've got what we view as our run rate combined. Round number, which is roughly a 2-point deterioration, as you can see on the page. It's 2.9, so knock a point off of that, it's about a 2-point deterioration in the margin. That's -- anytime you look at the quarter, you've got weather spikes, you've got weather compared to what weather was last year, if a quarter was made -- an adjustment was made in this quarter or an adjustment was made in prior-year quarter and then we put so 3 quarters worth of the impact in one spot, the numbers get wacky.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And in a given quarter, there'll be an episodic large loss that's not really run rate driven. Our best analysis, as Brian says, is looking at the reported ex-cat of 98.2 and we see about a point in there that's driven by what we would certainly consider non-run rate items.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right. And back to about 2 points of margin compression for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "First question, you mentioned on previous calls that the delta between new business pricing and renewals are shrinking. I just wanted to know, is that still the case? If can update us on that. And the reason I really asked this is broker Brown & Brown yesterday made some comments that would maybe contrast with that statement a little bit, and then I've got a follow-up.", "Brian W. MacLean", "No, our experience is that it is continuing to shrink a little bit.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And we would, as a matter of -- I don't have a number to give you on this. But as we've been speaking with our field people, a very relevant question is okay. We get what you're doing in the renewal rate arena, but what are you doing in the new business arena? What we're instructing our field people to do is to bring that higher level of expected rate to their new business negotiations. That's very, very important. It's the instructions that they're getting or to be as return focused in new. It doesn't mean the returns are equivalent but to be as a return focused in new as they are in renewal. And to the extent that new business falls off, that's just fine. No issue there. Do you want to add any? No? And anything in Personal or FPII that you want to add or...", "William E. Cunningham", "I don't think it's much of the dynamic in [indiscernible]", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, because you're all the same. You have the same pricing. It's a Business Insurance phenomenon.", "Brian W. MacLean", "What we know factually, Keith, is our experience,  the target that we're putting out and what we believe the prices that we're writing in at is the GAAP is narrowing some for us. Whether it's unique, we don't know.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then for Jay, you guys have done a nice job achieving and articulating the progress on rate the last several quarters. But just more big picture. How do you link a needed rate increases with the current yield realities? And then more specifically, is the rate you're getting today commensurate with the drop in net investment income you're experiencing now and going forward?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Those are great questions. They really are. And something that we spend a tremendous amount of time here analyzing and looking at. So first is, as I've shared with all of you before, we do have a quarterly analysis that looks at renewal, return on allocated capital, as well as new business return on allocated capital for every product that we sell in every business. And it's a policy view. What I mean by it, it's literally the term we use internally. It's an analysis which attempts to say given everything we know today, rate today, loss trend today, what is the return on that product. About -- I got to check specifically, but maybe 9 months ago, we determined to update that analysis for the new yield curve in such a way that the analysis now calculates these returns as if all the new money is going in against the yield curve as it's currently structured. Now the last time we -- meaning, all the premium money. The capital bears a percentage of the return embedded in the portfolio but the new money goes in against the old curve, and we just count it back. We have not yet updated it for what I would say are the events over the last 6 weeks because the yield curve is most certainly flattening again. And I don't know how long it will stay but once we become convinced that that's longer rather than shorter, we will update it for that. The returns are not -- I'm not going to share with you what they are, but when we know them. We know them and we understand the impact both of the declining investment environment, as well as the impact in our property lines of weather. And obviously, the long tail lines are more impacted by the investment environment. The shorter tailed lines are more impacted by the weather. But no matter how you look at it, they were all impacted. That gets us to driving for rate. Because while I believe, and I do believe this, I believe that our accident year return on equity overall in a normal weather year, whatever that means, is still in excess of our cost of equity. And I believe that it is. We still need to begin to drive rate because the portfolio will continue to mature and roll over into the lower yields. And we've got to make sure that we always have in mind delivering superior returns relative to our cost of equity. So we're on it. And that's why the urgency here for, as a matter of tactics, I would say, it is now all about rate. It is all about rate.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Wanted to just follow up on a couple of items that obviously we've been discussing. One is just on the potential for margin inflection. I just want to be clear. Has your margin already inflected? I mean, effectively, what you're saying is in September and October, pricing is outstripping loss? And so what I'm trying to assess is margins on an accident year ex-cat, ex-reserve basis, core margins have been deteriorating for several years now. Should we begin to inflect them into next year in our models?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So the first important thing and we try to say it, but let's emphasize it. We're talking about written rate. So the 4.3 points of rate that we're seeing in September in Business Insurance, we believe is ahead of our current view of loss trend. That needs to earn into the income statement over time. And so to the extent that we can string a reasonable number of months together like that, it will begin to earn in. But that earns in the way premium earns in. So it's 1/12 at a time. And so we are not saying that in September, the month in our income statement, we saw margin expansion. Just to be crystal clear.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, and I'm more thinking about next year. So are there any businesses right now where margins are -- where pricing is below loss trend?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right now, in all of our segments...", "Jay S. Fishman", "On an earned basis, let's make sure we're answering the right question.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Okay, yes. On a written basis, we feel that in all of our segments, we are ahead of loss trend. Maybe modestly. Yes, assuming a normalized weather, if any of us know what normal weather is anymore. But...", "Jay S. Fishman", "But the realization of that, 2 things have to happen. We have to continue to deliver at least that level of rate and also, we have to keep monitoring loss trend to make sure that doesn't change because of inflation or any other element. But that -- not even back of the envelop which is said to me, when will this begin to evident itself, and it doesn't mean that in the aggregate, margins will at your face expand but, Brian, given the timing, by the time we get to the second quarter of next year, if this pattern continues at that point, and we should test that because I'm doing this really on the fly. But by the time we get to the second quarter, I would think that, in fact, the combined ratio would begin to shrink all other things being the same.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's very -- Brian, were you going to comment? Or that's very helpful. Okay, Great. And then actually just a question, again, you guys are very thoughtful on ROE and capital allocation. It's tied into your management compensation. So how are you -- it's very, very difficult unless we have a substantial margin improvement next year to get to an ROE into the double digits, well into the double digits. So how do you set goals for next year, given where yields are at, sort of building off to Keith's question earlier? But the combined ratio is only one lever. The other lever in investments is sort of is what it is, and it's out there.", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, that's -- it's, again, another thoughtful question, Greg. Two things. One is that from a GAAP perspective, meaning the earnings per share that we will report, the investment yield continues to take time. It rolls -- the portfolio rolls obviously, but it doesn't happen all at once. So from a pure GAAP reported perspective, it's not as bad as if one did the analysis, assuming the entire portfolio were currently invested at current yields. So we have 2 separate analysis to do. What drives our pricing is pure economics. What current rates are available to invest new premium dollars that we bring in. We don't kid ourselves one bit. We understand and fundamentally discount back at today's yields in the aggregate. And we haven't done our budget yet for next year, and it's not as if management -- we don't think that we have levers to drive things differently. And we will do it, but we will be benefited in that regard by the fact that the portfolio doesn't all turnover at one instant. And so it's always important to keep those 2 different tracks in mind.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions. The first is, there was another company that in their pre-announcement suggested some loss pressure in the surety business because of economic conditions. And I was wondering if you're seeing any signs of that? And then, secondly, the favorable development, particularly in the Financial, Professional & International segment, was really quite strong. And I'm wondering if you can give us more color what lines of business, what accidents this year that's coming from -- what's driving that very strong favorable development?", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. On the surety side, we've certainly seen that the same commentary you've seen on others. We're just not seeing that in our portfolio, and I would attribute that to careful selection, and we've been talking about that for a number of quarters and that would explain in part why our surety premiums have been under some pressure. But that business is really all about discipline underwriting and risk selection, and we really focused intensely on credit quality. And we measure the credit quality of our book, and we've got our own proprietary credit scoring. And while I wouldn't say it's an all-time high, when you look at it on a historical basis, it's still very, very favorable and it's where we would've expected to be, thinking back to what our expectations were several years ago. So there's been some movement in that credit quality, but entirely within expectations, and we're very comfortable with the risks in our surety portfolio.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Just to come back as you went through it quickly, you said premiums were under pressure, that's from a perspective of underwriting thoughtfulness, a voluntary.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Risk selection and essentially seeding to the market risks that we weren't prepared to write. Your second question related to prior development and it's hard to point to one thing. It expands a number of action at years, expands really all the geographies and there isn't one particular item or trend I'd point out as necessarily driving that. It really is broadly base.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple here. First, Jay, historically, you've given us what the impact of the lower investment yield environment would potentially be on investment income going forward. Could you give us any update on where we stand right now given the current investment yield environment?", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, yes, I mean, in terms of the basic analysis, it really hasn't changed fundamentally. What we do -- what we've done historically is, we've provided an estimate of how much of the fixed income portfolio would \"mature\" -- and I'll say why, quote, unquote in a second -- over the next 3 years. We don't just look at the maturities as a function of what the documents say. We take a look at, given the interest-rate environment, what's likely to prepay as well. So I think in the past, looking at 2012, we had said something to the effect of about $6 billion or so would roll over in the portfolio, given where rates are, that number will be a little bit higher, possibly $6.5 billion, $7 billion. Although I will say that my own, and this is my view, my question, not even a view, I mean, given what drives that meaning mortgage prepayments, in this environment, it's really not really clear how they're actually going to perform. So it could actually be closer to the $6 billion. But in any event, it's that kind of a proportion of the portfolio, and then the rest is we've given the rates as to what is embedded in the portfolio. I mean, generally speaking, on a tax equivalent basis, it's been somewhere in the 4%, 4.5% range of what's coming due. So it's anybody's guess what rate to use for a reinvestment assumption, I think when we started doing this, it was 75 basis points, then it was 150 basis points. I think if you look at it today, it would be closer to the 150, maybe a little more, so I mean, pick that. But that's basically the nature of the analysis.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Also, a lot of fix income securities have periods of call protection. Traditionally, about 10 years in much the muni portfolio. So we have to incorporate that. And that's not really apparent to someone looking at it from the outside unless you wade through it security by security.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you. And are you doing anything with your investment portfolio, try to limit the degradation you're going to see in the book yields?", "Brian W. MacLean", "We have always operated on the principle that we'll try to get the best return the market gives us, but not more than the best return the market gives us. Actually, right now, we're emphasizing credit quality. Because we think, no matter which way things break, it's going to be even more important than it was 2 or 3 years ago to have the highest credit quality you can. So we're not reaching for yield. We're taking much what the market will give us.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Brian, just to build his comment further in the portfolio, I don't recall it being structured any shorter from the duration standpoint than it is now.", "Brian W. MacLean", "It has gotten shorter simply by mathematical operation. Obviously, as you move along the price yield curve, the slope of the tangent changes, and the duration changes even if the portfolio is unchanged. But our duration is about as short as we would want it now.", "Jay S. Benet", "And that actually, given the flat yield curve, is really a place you sort of want to be at the moment. And to the extent that we're wrong, and we always consider the possibility that we're wrong and rates rise, we're going to be happy we positioned the portfolio that way.", "Brian W. MacLean", "And if they don't rise, we don't think we're much prejudiced.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just a quick technical follow-up on the investment portfolio. It's just -- the private equity securities, those get marked on a quarterly basis, correct?", "Jay S. Benet", "They are -- we mark some according to the audited statements from the funds themselves, although obviously, much of the NII from private equity is the result the realizations, when private equity funds sell companies in their portfolio. And there's a slight lag, but it's not great.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. All right. Just most of those private equities -- the audited statements, though, are about quarterly lag, right?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. The other that which is -- that's fine. I just wanted to make sure I had that technique correct. And then I guess either for Brian or Jay. You've talked about what you're doing on pricing as being very much a Traveler specific effort. But are you seeing any signs in the field that your efforts are maybe emboldening some of your competition to potentially take the same tack?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We've been so focused on our own business and our own strategy and our own steps. I mean, I've been out meeting with agents. Brian has been out meeting with agents. We're just -- this is -- it's absorbing all of our attention. So the answer to that is I don't know.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just on the agency side, on the distribution side, with respect to new business, are you seeing any change kind of in kind of where new business is coming from at this point? And the only reason I asked is just that there has been continued talk by some of the brokers and some of the private distributors that there's increasing churns so just was curious whether or not you're seeing any difference, not really different sources bringing you new business or any differences between kind of distribution coming on renewal, who's bring you renewal versus new?", "William E. Cunningham", "Yes, this is Bill. The short answer is no. We're not seeing a change.", "Jay S. Fishman", "It will be interesting to watch. Obviously, churn is the inverse of retention ratios. And our retention ratios remain pretty high. I would guess listening to a few the other companies over the next few days into what their retention ratios have been will give you real insight into whether that's true or not. From our experience, the answer would be no. But that doesn't mean it's universal.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Just on going back to non-cat weather. So I guess I presume that year-to-date, the entire 4.3 point underwriting deterioration accident year ex-cat for personal lines, that would all be attributed or primarily attributed to non-cat weather?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Hey, Larry, this is Greg Toczydlowski. Predominantly, that's absolutely true. Close to 80% of it is non-cat weather, and we saw that on both the automobile lines and the property lines.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Okay. And then I think, when you previously had been given -- giving annual earnings guidance, your suggested cat load at that time was I think around $600 million. And from Jay's comments, anybody's guess on normal weather these days, I know it's probably a hard thing to peg down. But is there any guidance you can give us on what a normal cat load is today?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, obviously, when we finally get to our budget for next year, we'll have a number such as it is. The only hesitation is that we're still sort of I'd say in the midst of RMS 11 and what that does to our cat loads. Jay said that it's going to increase some and it will as a result of that program, not so much just to put us out of, in effect, out of policy or out of line with our capital committed to it, but it is going to change. So I just think it's early, Larry. And we'll give some thought as to whether after that work whether we feel comfortable providing some more insight. I understand it's an important factor for everyone to understand, and we obviously have made a disclosure of it in our -- not of the average annual loss, but of our tail exposure in our 10-K. So when we get there, maybe we'll have a basis for saying something about what our average annual loss estimates are.", "Operator", "Our next question, coming from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBY.", "Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Most of my questions are answered. I guess, I could ask on the property lines just to clarify the point. You talk about rate increases being pretty strong in the high single-digit range. But the RMS model changed again, changing your weather expectations. So how should we think about the expected return on the business? And in net, is expected return still rising?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, first, let me -- because I'm not sure I'm connecting a part of your question. Let's make it clear. RMS 11 is, in effect, a hurricane model. What it's doing is it's taking our estimates of windstorm, hurricane windstorm and changing it, which is important in lots of property risks, but not every property risk. We have lots of property risks that are not hurricane exposed. So RMS will have an impact, obviously, on our -- I think in the end what it will have an impact on is our pricing view of hurricane exposed risks. Not everywhere because we're going to get down to the point of identifying where the changes are into very specific geographies. This is not where we get a one-number output, and we spread it for everybody. We're going to use that model and help us drive thoughtful pricing decisions in specific geographic areas. But it's a windstorm focused model. In terms of pricing on property, generally, I don't know what we said. We didn't say a number. We didn't say high single-digits. We said that...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Our largest quarter-over-quarter improvement but we didn't give you the numbers.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And what's really driving that -- and it's important because what's driving that is not yet, I would say, RMS 11. What's really driving that is the experience, predominantly windstorm and hail, tornado and hail, that we've had the last several years. If you go back to -- I don't remember if it was last quarter or the quarter before, we can either make the decision that we're really smart and we've been unlucky or we can make the decision that something different is happening, whether we fully understand it or not, and we should react to it. We've chosen the latter. And as a consequence, if you look in the areas that are meaningfully tornado exposed, we used to talk about tornado alley, the data suggests that's not so relevant anymore. That the people remind me all the time, we have one in Springfield, Massachusetts this year sucking the water right out of the Connecticut River. So as you sit back, as we sit back and just think about weather in fact we're in some cycle, I'm not making any global warming statement here, but maybe we're in a cycle of more active storms, we've got to react, and so our reacting here. And all of -- many analysts tend to think all the time of Homeowners. They immediately go there. We have a substantial property exposure in our commercial book, in our small commercial business and in our middle market businesses. So the dynamic of property extends way beyond Homeowners, which actually, that's the reason I gave the data. We've been achieving 8 to 9 points of what we call their renewal price change for the last several periods.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right. So there, we have been getting high single-digits for a couple of years now.", "Jay S. Fishman", "That's right. And that maybe where you're getting it from. That was a comment about renewal price, renewal rate change, or price change in Homeowners. But there is a full dynamic of property exposure in our commercial business where, obviously, for competitive reasons, we're not being quite as transparent about what our particular strategies are other than to say it was the largest increase, right, it was the largest improvement.", "Operator", "Our last question, coming from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just trying to get a sense of how systematic the asbestos reserves charges might be. And in the press release, you mentioned the current litigation environment was driving higher settlement costs. Is it plaintive tactics, is it jury wars, is it the bad economy in certain states? Just trying to get a feel for what's continuing to drive the adverse development there and what you might be able to do to try and mitigate that?", "Jay S. Benet", "I'll try to answer the question and maybe Dorian [ph] or Alan will try them as well. But we make estimates all the time as to what our future costs regarding today. And in this particular case, we had made an estimate that would suggest that the costs would go down slightly. And instead of going down slightly, they went up slightly. We are in a situation where -- and we think is a good thing that the miso cases are the ones that are getting tried. It\u2019s not like many years ago where they were whole package pre-bankruptcies, and whole different set of circumstances. But this is slugging it out on court on a case-by-case basis. And depending upon what the situation is, your defense costs are going to be either smaller or larger than what your expectations are. And they just have been running a little bit larger than what we had previously expected, when we set the reserve. Having said that, we don't view it as any fundamental change in the way the asbestos environment is operating.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Right. And the only thing I'd add to that is there are several jurisdictions that you see an increase of the attack on peripheral defendants, which really don't have a lot of liability. But those meso cases are fairly serious. And so we're assisting in short defend against them. And so that's what's really driving up the defense cost.", "Jay S. Fishman", "For the record [indiscernible]", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Now that's helpful. Just to clarify then, so if it's your point, now it is a most mesothelioma cases and that kind of the broad asbestos kind of thing then, I mean, how do we think about this annually? It should be a Decane [ph] liability, yet you're continuing to have issues. So is this kind of the last gasp of this as these mesos move through the system? Or should we think about this being something we have to deal with every third quarter?", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, we do want to make a point that if you look at the gross reserve increase last year versus the gross reserve increase this year, it was less this year than last year. And as it relates to the population, one would have to believe that there's some point in time where this drops off, now just given the passage of time and the exposure periods, as well as when the asbestos exclusions kicked in, in terms of the way the policies were written. Having said that, whatever this decay rate is, it will be what it will be, and we're trying to estimate it each year. And that's what these adjustments relate to, what's the actual decay rate versus what's been anticipate in the reserve setting.", "Operator", "Ms. Nawi, I will now turn the call back to you.

Good morning, and welcome to Travelers discussion of our fourth quarter and 2011 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplements and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of the these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.

The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.

Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available on the Investor section on our website. And now Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased that we posted solid results in the fourth quarter with net income per share at $1.51 and return on equity of 10%. The story for the full year, of course, was the remarkable weather. Weather losses were far and away the worse in our history, and as a consequence, net earnings per share of $3.36 for the year were considerably lower than what we've become accustomed to. Nevertheless, we price our product for the long term, and of course, we don't control the weather. There will be years such as 2006 and '07 in which weather losses are surprisingly low, and of course, there will be years, but hopefully not too many, in which losses will be high. ", "Also a less financially significant, but nonetheless important piece of the 2011 story was the persistent low fixed-income investment environment. A 1.5 years ago, in the middle of 2010, we made the important decision that we were going to actively take steps in terms of rate terms and conditions to improve future returns in light of the insurance pricing environment and our view that it was increasingly likely that we would be facing low fixed-income yields for some time to come. We increased those efforts in the middle of 2011 in recognition of the possibility that weather patterns might be changing prospectively for the worst, particularly given the active weather we experienced in 2010 and into the first half of 2011. ", "We've shared with you before that we are just not big believers in magic market cycles. We understand that our business is about one underwriter and one agent discussing one account at a time. But we believe that our franchise were strong enough that we could seek improved profitability through improved rate terms and conditions without adverse effect to our business. And 18 months later, we have proven that to be the case in most of our commercial businesses. We take these actions selectively where analytics suggest they are warranted, and we try very hard never to be disruptive to our agents or insureds. In our judgment, the success we've experienced speaks to the value that we bring to agents and customers and the success we've had positions the company very well going into 2012. In particular, Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, had a pure renewal rate gain of more than 6% for the quarter and 8% for December. As a result, given our current view of loss trends, we anticipate widening of the underlying underwriting margins in Business Insurance in the first half of 2012. ", "In Personal Insurance, the regulatory environment is such that while the progress we've made is important, the real evidence of success remains ahead of us as we continue to roll out the pricing and underwriting changes that we have decided to pursue. But I want to emphasize that the steps we are taking are not limited to rate. There are a number of levers available to us in addition to rate as we pursue improved returns. It include underwriting actions, particularly with respect to risk selection and location, as well as changing underwriting standards with respect to roofs and loss history in Personal Insurance. We've always been attentive to our expense base and we continue to be very thoughtful in that regard. ", "Our commitment to improving perspective returns in Personal Insurance is no less than that which we had in Business Insurance when we began this program 18 months ago. Every personalized franchise is unique. Every company's agent group is different, and importantly, the value proposition to the insureds is quite different company to company. We believe that we will be successful given our agents, our insureds and the value that we bring. So while the bottom line financial results this year were less than we would hoped, we couldn't be more pleased and more proud of our people when we look at the progress we've made to achieve improved returns, particularly given the difficult environment that continues to confront the U.S. economy. ", "We have really demonstrate the value of the Travelers franchise to agents and insureds as well as the strength and diversity of the business that has allowed us to achieve all that we have over the past 18 months. We ran the business for the long term and focus on returns over time. We're also pleased and proud that since 2005, we've generated an average annual upgrade and return on equity of 13%. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that we have maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of $2.4 billion. Operating cash flow is $351 million for the quarter, which included unusually high claim payments that resulted from this year's severe weather and $150 million payment to our qualified pension plan that even in this very low interest environment kept our funding level close to 90%. And consistent with an ongoing capital management strategy, we continue to return excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.2 billion of our common stock, which was at the top of our previously announced range and paid $166 million in dividends, bringing year-to-date common stock repurchases to $2.9 billion and year-to-date dividends to $669 million. As was the case this quarter, there have been many periods during the past several years in which our share repurchase and dividends significantly exceeded our earnings. We achieved this by diligently and systematically identifying opportunities to free up capital, returning that freed-up capital to our shareholders. ", "After several years of working at it, the process of freeing up capital is now largely complete so we now expect the future common share repurchases will be driven more by future earnings levels, taking into account capital needed for business growth and corporate needs such as death service and pension obligations. Having said that, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital shareholders, whatever the source. ", "I'd also like to point out that all of our capital ratios remain at or better than target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains increased by $337 million during the quarter to $4.4 billion pretax or almost $2.9 billion after tax and book value per share rose to $62.32, a 7% increase since the beginning of the year. So now let me turn the microphone over to Brian to go through the results in more detail.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. I'll start with Business Insurance, and the real news in this segment is that the rate on the business we are writing is up significantly in the last 6 months and is now meaningfully exceeding our current view of loss trend. ", "Renewal premium change of 8% for the quarter included pure rate increases of over 6%. This marks the fourth consecutive quarter that Business Insurance has seen positive rate change on renewed accounts, and as with recent quarters, rate increase across all product lines, with the largest increases in workers' comp and auto. We are very pleased that the months within the quarter continue to show sequential improvement in pricing with December renewal premium change of 10% and pure rate increase of 8% for the segment. And based on our preliminary look at January business, pure rate gain looks pretty similar to what we achieved in December. ", "Net written premiums were up year-over-year, driven by pricing gains and positive audit premiums. Retention and new business levels were solid, though down somewhat from recent quarters. As we mentioned last quarter, execution on our pricing strategy may impact business volumes going forward, and so far we continue to remain very comfortable with a balance between improved pricing and volume. ", "Through 2011, this has been a very easy call. I want to emphasize here that when we speak about pricing strategy, our goal is not simply to increase the price on every account. It's a very granular approach based on analytics where we're looking for the appropriate price for the individual risk or the class of business. It's never been a one-size-fits-all approach. ", "Turning to losses. Overall loss trend was relatively benign. In workers\u2019 comp, we saw some higher-than-expected frequency from 2010. In commercial auto, 2009 and 2010 bodily injury and 2011 physical damage losses were above our initial expectation. So some movement in loss trend concentrated in the 2010 accident year, but more than offset by increased prices. ", "In summary, we feel extremely positive about the results in Business Insurance. And in our current pricing levels, we believe that we will be generating underlying underwriting margin expansion beginning in the first half of 2012. ", "In the Financial, Professional & international Insurance segment, operating income of $152 million for the quarter was very strong and consistent with the prior year quarter. This caps a very good year for the segment with full year earnings up more than 4% over what was a good 2010 result. ", "In surety, we continue to see strong margins and slightly less volume driven by sluggishness in construction spending. We could not be more pleased that we've been able to maintain our current position as the market leader in this business during a very challenging economic environment without a meaningful increase in losses. That we have done so speaks volumes about our ability to select risks, the credit quality of this business and our approach of running this business for the long term. ", "Looking at management liability. This remains a line of business where market pricing continues to be challenged, but less so at the smaller end, which is the source of most of our premium. While our pricing here has lagged most of our other businesses, we were able to achieve positive renewal premium change for the second quarter in a row. This is reflective of favorable production results in our private and non-profit business and is due in part to benefits from recent technology investments. ", "In international, net written premiums were down quarter-over-quarter due primarily to the timing of a few small reinsurance transactions and our exit from the personal lines of business in Ireland. Over the past several years, we have increased our focus on our international operations, and we are pleased with the progress to date. The quarter-over-quarter improvement in the underlying loss ratio more than offset the increase in the expense ratio, which is a good sign that the investment is paying off. ", "In Personal Insurance. Looking at auto profitability, the story is essentially the same as discussed for commercial auto. We've seen a moderate increase from expectations in bodily injury severity for the most recent accident years and the higher-than-anticipated level of claim frequency in severity in the physical damage coverages for the 2011 accident year. The quarter-over-quarter impact of these items both from prior year and 2011 prior quarters was almost 6 combined ratio points. Because of this volatility and the normal seasonality in the quarter, we think a better way to focus on the run rate of the business is to look at the full year combined ratio, which after adjusting for cats and prior-year development, was 99.5. This includes 1 point directly attributable to higher non-cat weather-related losses. And so 98.5 is our view of the current run rate, which is only 2 to 3 points higher than the combined ratio required to get us back to our historical target return. As Jay mentioned, we are committed to improving returns in this product in 2012 by aggressively pursuing rate and implementing local underwriting strategies. ", "In Homeowners and Other, profits were once again down in the quarter due primarily to adverse weather. Although, the impact of the weather in the fourth quarter was dramatically less than in recent quarters, it was still slightly higher than expectations, driven by the unusual northeast October snowstorm. In addition, we did have some increased claim activity in the non-cat weather from earlier in the year. ", "As we have said many times, we obviously don't know what the weather will be in 2012, but given the experience of the last several years, we are managing the business with the expectation that weather losses may continue to run above longer term historical averages. Accordingly, we are taking a broad-based assertive approach to managing the property product, which includes not only executing local pricing strategies but also seeking to tighten underwriting standards and changes in terms and conditions. ", "As examples, we are underwriting for age and quality of roof, re-assessing how we factor in the number and type of previous claims and implementing higher minimum deductibles for weather and non-weather claims. Additionally, we are changing a small portion of our re-insurance program to create a structure that better responds to higher frequency, lower severity events. So we are taking a lot of actions in homeowners and are confident that these actions will further enhance the long-term profitability of our industry-leading franchise. ", "Turning to production. For both Agency Auto and Property, renewal premium changed and retention remains strong while new business continues to trend down slightly as we accelerate our pricing, underwriting and terms and conditions action. With that, I'll open it up to.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Carlos, you can open it up for Q&A now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Yes, ma'am. Ma'am would you like me to read the Q&A instructions now?", "Gabriella Nawi", "No. It's okay. You can open -- you can open it up to questions now.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Ma'am, would you like me to go to the first question?", "Gabriella Nawi", "Yes, please.", "Operator", "And the first question comes from the line of Keith Walsh with Citi.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Couple of questions. First, Business Insurance. You've alluded to in the press release the underwriting margin, it looked like it would potentially improve in the first half of '12. Is this more optimistic than what you guys talked about last quarter where you seem to be a lot more adamant that this would take time to earn in over the next 12 months? And then I've got a follow-up.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, Keith, this is Jay. The rate that we earned -- the rate that we wrote -- I'm sorry, the rate we wrote in the fourth quarter was obviously at a higher level than that which we wrote in the third quarter. So going into 2012, as we look out into 2012 as it earns, we are not more optimistic because that implies an attitude. This is fact. The fact is, the rate in the fourth quarter was higher than the rate in the third. So wherever we were in the third quarter with respect to margins, we're better off today, and it will simply take the time to earn that written premium into earn. So I'd say that it's not a matter of optimism, meaning feeling, it's really a matter of arithmetic and fact. We're in a better position today than we were at the end of the third quarter with respect to the speed with which those margins will expand, and assuming that we continue to earn rate at this level, the effect that it will have in the margin arena.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then just sticking with Business Insurance. Obviously, the rates are good, but let's focus on the other part of the game here. I guess, the retention in new business which are both pretty -- down pretty sharply on the new business side, especially. So what are the dynamics of not just the accounts you're keeping, which we can see in the rate, but what about the accounts you are losing? What's really going on there? If you could talk about new business hit rate. Thanks.", "Jay S. Fishman", "First, I would disagree categorically with your characterization of this down sharply. The retention in Business Insurance for the fourth quarter was at 81%...", "Jay S. Benet", "79%.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'm sorry. 79%. 79% was commercial. 79%. In the context of thinking about business long term, that's still an exceptionally high retention rate. I mean, we've gotten used to rates in those mid-80s that, frankly, we've never ever seen before. If you go back to the period in the late '90s and early 2000s and middle market retention, we struggled to get it above a number that started with a 7. So what's happening on the Business Insurance side is really -- it's just fine. This is an easy trade-off. The one segment of the business where retention has been lower than others has been in the larger end of Select, right? You may recall that we define Select as the smallest end, which is highly technological. And then there's Express Plus, which is the larger end of Select. That category remains a more challenging pricing environment. It has to do with the way we think that regionals compete and how they view middle market pricing. They don't have the technology to really compete effectively at the low end of small commercial. They don't have the infrastructure to compete effectively at the true middle market business that we define, so they tend to land in that larger end segment. We've established our own thresholds for return expectations, and to the extent that we can capture business that meets those return thresholds, we'll take it, and to the extent somebody else decides they want to take it away from us at a lower price, that's just fine. We're -- so far, this has gone better than I think any of us would have expected 18 months ago. And the trade-off at this point between return gains and retentions, as we described it, is losses. It's just fine. What was the 81%? The 81% was...", "Brian W. MacLean", "81% was Commercial Accounts...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Commercial accounts, yes...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Overall -- this is Brian. Overall in retention, x the high end of Select, we are right around 80%, a little bit north of 80%, and we feel great about that. On the new business front, we're going to look at business in the marketplace and if we can find stuff that meets our return thresholds, we're going to write it. And in this environment, we're not going to search below that.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'd make other observation -- and it's more challenging for us in quantify it and demonstrate it, but we have indicators that will support what I'm about to say. New business pricing is also better than it was. It's part of the measure because you simply don't have the prior-year expiring premium to compare it, but we are comparing new business pricing against the manual rate that we construct. And when you look at that pattern, there are 2 things that are really encouraging. One is that there's clearly lift going on. And two, that the gap between -- and I'm not speaking necessarily about this particular quarter, but looking at it over a longer period of time here, 6 , 8 months, the gap between renewal and new has narrowed. And so both of those things give us a pretty good sense of confidence that the pricing for new business is lifting as well. Can't quite quantify it with the level of precision that we can renewal, but we feel awfully good about it.", "Brian W. MacLean", "The one comment last comment I'd make on new is that our flow is still very solid. So if this was a matter of we weren't getting opportunity to quote on business and we weren't quoting, we'd be a lot more concerned with that. So we feel good about the flow, we feel good about our activity in the marketplace and profitably levels will be where they will be.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay A. Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Two questions, both related to pricing. Can you talk about your desire in 2012 to continue to push for rate on the commercial side? Because obviously, you've achieved a certain amount of rate already. Is that desire still very much in place? Or will you be satisfied now where the priced ROEs are and you don't need to push as much? That's question number one. And then secondly, if you could describe the dialogue you're having with agents and brokers. Obviously, your effort is to improve profitability, improve returns, theirs is to do the best for their clients. How much pushback or are you getting from the agents and have you sensed a change in that pushback?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Jay, I'll take on the first one. No, our strategy now remains as is. We're going to continue to do this selectively, thoughtfully targeted, but we are going to continue. And our goal -- we get asked all the time, \"What's the target?\" We don't have one. And that's partially because some of the conditions that we're responding to were just not as clear to us as they might be. I'm speaking specifically about weather. I'm speaking about investment returns. And so we're going to try and drive our products and our returns back to the historical kind of broad-based targets. We still have a mid-teens ROE as a -- long term. We talked about it over time, but we still very much have that as a long-term target. We are most certainly, from an individual pricing basis, this is important now, I'm not speaking about the return on equity in the whole place, I'm getting very granular with you in talking about the returns on allocated capital of individual products based upon the rate that we have in place today and our immediate view of loss trend. We are getting closer. We are making real progress in getting back to the levels that will ultimately convert it to mid-teens ROE on a GAAP basis. So we got some to go yet but we are encouraged and we're going to keep driving until we find whether we can or not get back to our historical kind of return thresholds. So that's, I think, the answer with what does 2012 feel like from a strategic and tactical perspective. [indiscernible] Bill Cunningham to talk about the agent arena.", "William E. Cunningham", "Good morning. I would say on overall basis, we look at our agent relationships as very strong partnerships and as being a strong partner, not surprising them is critical. So being upfront early in the process with our agent in terms of what we're doing on an overall basis, but more importantly, as Brian mentioned, this is not a one-size-fits-all. So every account communicated to the agent as early in the process as possible because our ultimate goal is together, to be out with the client, explaining why we need a given rate increase on a given transaction. At the same time, we do -- from time to time, agents feel a need to test where we're coming from, so they give them time to do that. But I would tell you on an overall basis, it has been very positive in terms of the feedback we received and how we've handled it. And so again, partnership early in the process, no surprises, together sitting down with the customer whenever possible and not putting them in a position where their back is against the wall is key to our partnership.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "A couple of questions here for you. First, going back to the auto insurance results that you're seeing in the quarter. When you talked about the 98.5 and need to get it down to a 96, I guess, the question I have there is, one, kind of what are you doing to get it down there? Is it just pure rate? And is the market kind of receptive of the type of rate that you need to get it back down to those 96 levels? And then I have one follow-up.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Brian, these is Greg Toczydlowski. In terms of the auto strategy, predominantly, a rate strategy that we're focused on automobile. When Jay and Brian talked about all the other levers that we're looking at from an underwriting in terms of conditions, we're focused a little more on the property side of the house with that. So we're monitoring our competitive position all the time and given the regulatory environment that we live in, it takes a little bit of time before we can get that rate grow, but we're feeling that we're continuing to see good flow and good retention numbers and we'll continue looking at that as we go forward with the business.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "But obviously, if you're writing at a 98.5, 99, that's not your kind of an acceptable return level. They can't get a double-digit ROE off of that, right?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "That is correct. We are shooting closer to that combined ratio that you threw off [ph] in 96 and we're going to be doing that through pricing.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And some of the dynamics, Brian, that we've been experiencing we suspect are more broad-based. This is just one. But it's -- some unusual -- the pattern has developed with the slowdown of the new automobile business generally. Price of used cars has risen. If the price of used cars has risen, what's been interesting is the number of accidents that result in total losses, where the car produces salvage, have actually gone down. The car relative value up. Auto repair cost much less so more cars are being put back on the road. And a consequence, we've seen of that is an increase in sheet metal cost. I'm not talking about new sheet metal. I'm speaking now about replacement parts. And that's not unique to us. That's going to be a condition that's going to affect lots of people. Now it may impact us a tad more because we tend to write more comprehensive coverage than some other carriers do, so we may be on a more extreme side of that. But the kinds of things that we're seeing are not things that -- it's very important, are not things that indicate problems with underwriting or risk selection. They are more episodic issues with respect to specific costs that are not, I would say, unique to us . So our hope is, and of course, we are going to find out, that we can go to the market and drive the kinds of rate increases that will bring this back, just like we did in Business Insurance. We started extremely slowly. We started 18 months ago asking fundamentally if our folks can get 1 point. That's what we said. Let's see if we can get 1 point, and we've built on that every month. We're going to take that same systematic, thoughtful and patient approach to auto insurance and homeowners and see what progress we can make.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then question for Brian. When you mentioned pure rate also up 8%, can you define that? Is that just rate less cost inflation?", "Brian W. MacLean", "No. When we say pure rate, we're looking at the components of the premium change.", "Jay S. Benet", "No exposure.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So it's the rate charged per -- exposure on that, on the average renewal.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Got you. And then how would that compare to what loss cost inflation kind of looks like in the quarter?", "Brian W. MacLean", "We don't peg the exact number, but we've said we're meaningfully exceeding it.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. Excellent. And then just lastly, Interest rate assumption when you're talking about getting rate, getting close to your kind of historical kind of double-digit ROE targets, what are you thinking about the interest rate environment?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Mechanics on that are that all new money is discounted at the current yield curve, basically, where we invest money today, and the surplus embedded in the business in that calculation is a more historical element premised on the fact that we have surplus that rolls off from old products and then comes on to support new. But importantly, we're not kidding ourselves the investment return. That's all new money at all new -- at current yield curve today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is on pricing. We've seen pricing and workers compensation and commercial auto up sharply because of high loss cost trends. Curious about what are trends you've seen in pricing and other lines that you're pushing this year versus last year?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So a couple of just clarifications on that. The comp and the auto, we have the strongest rate improvement. It's not just because we're seeing -- or it's not because we're seeing sharp increases in loss cost there. Obviously, pricing always has something to do with the loss cost trend, but it's not a sharp increase. We saw a fairly significant increase of a couple of points, really, on almost every single line of business we write. So this isn't an example where comp is spiking up dramatically. Auto's up a lot and everything else is kind of flat. I would say every line in the commercial space is moving comp and auto more dramatically, but it's not completely out of pattern with everything else.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Are you talking about rate?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Rate. I'm talking about rate change.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And as Brian reminds all of us, and you as well. In many of our lines of business. It's very much a state-by-state story. There tends to be this view that it's one national rate. It's not. There are states where either frequency or severity underlying trends are either more concerning or less concerning than others. So our reaction with respect to rate and what we're trying to accomplish is very much driven by the state environment, specific to that particular risk.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Fair enough. That's helpful. As a follow-up, what is the impact of non-cat to weather for all the segments? I believe for the personal lines, it was 2 years for the full year.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Non-cat weather? I'm looking at Greg. Non-cat weather in PI for the full year. Can we disclose that level of granularity, I guess, is the question.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "It's not something that we've disclosed previously. We obviously have some view of it, but the substance of that answer is functionally dependent upon whether our assumption of normal weather is right or wrong or high or low. So rather than trying to get into a debate of how much was non-cat weather, we just -- that's just -- it's internal, and I'm not sure the data is all that meaningful.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Fair enough. And just one last thing, if I may, what -- to what amount of rate increase do you think on the personal auto line do you think will be necessary for you to get to your level of profitability that you're targeting?", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, the arithmetic is actually pretty simple. In Personal Insurance, if we want to drive the combined ratio down by 2 points, we got to get about 3 points of rate above and beyond what we otherwise would, because we are obviously in effect, I'd say, always getting rate. That's not universally true. But fundamentally, it's a business where the renewal price change has always been positive. I can't recall that it ever went to a [indiscernible]...", "Gabriella Nawi", "Up 2 to 3 points.", "Jay S. Benet", "So that's really the dynamic of kind of 3 points of rate above and beyond we would otherwise get, and under the presumption that loss trend stays about where it is. So there's an all other things being equal dynamic. But the answer to that is it's not as far away as it might otherwise see. Now the marketplace will have to say whatever it wants to say and we're obviously aware of that. And our influence, our market consequence, our breadth in Business Insurance is I think one of the attributes that's enabled us to accomplish what we did in PI whether -- we'll see whether that same dynamic holds true in personal in the same way. But it's just not that far off.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Just jumping back to his first question because we have answered part of this in the past, so on the non-cat weather. I mean, we said last quarter in Business Insurance, and it's still probably about the right number, is there's a point in the combined ratio of variance above a normal non-cat weather number for the year. I said -- in the quarter, it was pretty flat in BI, but for the year, it' still about 1 point. In auto personal lines, I said there was a point of clearly identifiable non-cat weather it might actually be more in auto. And the Whole number, I don't remember off the top of my head.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "They are going to go on a same basis. Full year property would be closer to 2 to 3 points.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Variance from a non-cat weather.", "Jay S. Fishman", "From whatever we [indiscernible] coming back to the notion of...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Whatever was normally our view of normal and weather always been.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays Capital.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Two questions for you. The first is on the share buyback pace for 2012. Should we be thinking about buybacks being equal to net income, operating earnings, retained earnings, can you just clarify?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, what we were trying to say was, it should be looked at based on earnings, so not retained earnings for sure. And then net income versus operating income, they are both income and they have tended to be relatively similar. So we think mostly in terms of operating income but if they were large realized gains or something, we would take that into account as well, but that would be more episodic.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. I just want to confirm. And then what's the sort of maximum comfort level on debt to capital x the unrealized gains?", "Jay S. Benet", "We've talked in the past about -- for AA company like us it's being in the 15% to 25% range. We are at a little over 23%. Part of the 23% is actually driven by prefunding $250 million of debt that's going to mature in 2012. So that's worth about 7 basis points in that calculation. But being within that range is a very comfortable place for us.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Got you. And then the final one is on the non-fixed income, after-tax earnings, it was down in 4Q versus 3Q. I'm just try to figure out what you feel would be a reasonable run rate heading into this year.", "William H. Heyman", "Jay, Bill Heyman. For what it's worth, the quarter came in just about exactly where we thought the quarter would come in on October 1 as we look to the matrix of factors which affect returns in the non-fixed income portfolio. I suspect the best way to make predictions about the future is to look at the bar graph. Back a few years, try to draw a mean, I figured that's about what we'll make because if we couldn't make that, we probably wouldn't maintain the portfolio. For what it's worth, there were no real surprises in the fourth quarter. This was about what we expected.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. So if I look at that over the past couple of years, probably averaging around $50 million to $65 million a quarter?", "Bill Malugen", "I'd have to look at the bar graph. I think on the low side of that.", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay. It's one of those things, as you know, it's really difficult to predict. So whatever you put in your model, there is a level of uncertainty. We have great visibility into the fixed-income part of the portfolio but this is going to be so dependent upon what the economy does.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to dig into the workers comp line for a bit, just get some color on the market, and I guess, more specifically, one of your competitors in Hartford has had -- has had some trouble -- some emerging troubles grow through 2011 in that line. Some other cracks are appearing from other competition. I know you don't believe in the cycle but what are you seeing specifically in that line? How do they manage their books of business different? And why are you so confident that this won't begin to have some issues into '12 and beyond?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Let me talk for a second about -- in a little more specific, what we're seeing. I'm not going to comment on how other companies might be managing their business but we can talk certainly about how we manage ours. So just to be clear on workers comp, what we saw this year, in the aggregate, continues to be a pretty strong picture for us. So if you look at the prior years, '02 through '09, every year continued to perform better than we had expected. So positive in every one of those years. In 2010, we did see...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Bill said to me yesterday, and make sure you still believe this, that if you look back to '02, the current expected loss outcome in each of the year '02 through '09 is currently lower than the original estimate at the time we made it.", "Jay S. Benet", "Better. Lower loss ratio, better result, right.", "Jay S. Fishman", "'02 through '09. So in 2010, we did see some continuation of the increase in late reported claims that we discussed in the second quarter. And we believe this is really a direct result of the impact of the great recession on workers comp claim reporting patterns. And so the 2010 year was out of pattern. But overall, all years, including 2010, we continue to have positive development on our overall workers comp book. The impact of all of that is fully reflected in not just 2010, but rolled into how we look at 2011 and what we booked there. And most importantly, is completely rolled into our pricing the products today. And given the pricing improvements that we've gotten, we feel good about the returns and the profitability levels of the comp business we're writing today. Now as Bill said before, it's a state-by-state game and very, very granularly managed.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And I've got a couple of other facts that I think would be helpful. First, the magnitude of the 2010, I'll call it, excess claim activity, to put a number on it, it was under $100 million after-tax. That's the -- that's the magnitude of that change. And again, what we see -- everything that we see tells us that those were occurring to dates, incidents in '10 that didn't manifest themselves until 2011. That's an unusual dynamic and something we haven't seen before. Maybe it's a function of the economy and how people feel about job security and whether they raise their hands or not. And again to Brian's point, we've rolled that forward into the 2011 loss estimate, book that fully and are currently incorporating that into our 2012 estimate for pricing and reserving. And this is -- I think it's important because it will, again, help quantify it. The combination of the rate gains and the loss trends and the positives and negatives and everything else, our estimate of that allocated return on capital measure that we use to measure the profitability of the products in workers\u2019 comp all-in now is low double digits. It's low double digits. So it's, I think, it's helpful to put a perspective on what we saw. Now our view on that 2010 development is that it's more, I'll call it timing rather than a permanent change. And of course, we'll see whether that's the case or not. To get back to your other question about -- and of course, you all know this, you're sophisticated analyst, you get it. The issue of how one company reports versus another. The critical element in all this is what did the company generally assumed? And so whatever experience we have in the loss arena is sort of one thing. But what original assumptions were made is a critical element in determining the embedded health of the business and I'd come back to the \u201802 to '09 period as at least indicative of the way we view the line. Importantly, severity remains as expected, that's an important element so the actual inflation dynamic there is not an issue. And lastly, and again, this just speaks to the mechanics of the business, and I think the integrity of the process here, the delta, the change that we had assumed from the '10 into the '11 year, that turned out to be a good -- at least so far, remains a good assumption. The base of your [indiscernible] change some, but the delta into '11 that we had anticipated turned out to be, at least, so far consistent. So a tiny bit of a complicated story but you've got all the news.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just a couple questions here. One thing you haven't talked about for a little while is the direct initiative. You mentioned and it looked like in the release about 80 basis points on a combined ratio, which something about $0.30 a share, if my math is right. Clearly, more significant than it was as a percentage of earnings when you launched it. Just kind of what do you look at in the development of that business to let you know that you're creating value and that you're hitting your objective so that it eventually starts to bring in earnings as opposed create that pressure? And just one follow-up.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'll let Doreen and Greg answer as well, but I picked -- the one element that we continue to work on from an operational dynamic is we're getting pretty good at getting people through the quote process and getting quotes out. And our next step is to do better. Next step, we're working on more than anything else right now is to do better in converting those quotes into actual sales. And it's not immediately apparent to us that it's a function of price, although, it won't surprise any of you. If you listen to all the ads, the comment is those who switched saved whatever the number is, $400. No great shock. $400, no great shock if you quote someone $400 more than they're currently paid, the likelihood of switching is actually pretty low. So to comment, price is not an insignificant element there. We have a -- I don't know exactly what to call it, but we have a conversion curve. We know -- relative to at least what the customer discloses to us, their current prices is, we know how far, either plus or minus to that mark, we -- in a large number of accounts, how close we need to be to convert. But we've got more work to do in the conversion process so that the dollars that we're spending in the media -- and we're not spending nearly what anyone else and the big players, but to maximize that investment, just to get more of the quotes converted into sales. So that's our dynamic. Some of it is, we suspect, I'll say, reputational. I think there are other companies that have, as a result of doing this for years, found a reputation for being less expensive. Whether that's true or not is a whole other question, but they've seen to have earned a reputation for it. And we have to continue to build a reputation dynamic around the value proposition that we give. We're never going to be great at selling half a coverage sandwich, which $6. We're not comfortable selling half the sandwich for $3.10. That's just certainly not that who we are culturally. We're much more comfortable providing customers with the coverage they need rather than the dynamic of how much they can afford. That's just not us. So we're going to keep working at this and we got our fingers crossed, but we're well on our way.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then just a little bit more on workers comp. Just the premium line was pretty bumpy during the year. I'm just curious. Is that a result of pure seasonality? Is that a result of maybe some change in the competitive dynamic or just the market itself or any strategic change on your end?", "Brian W. MacLean", "It's actually more just pricing and audit premium running through the numbers. So a decent piece of that is movement of the underlying exposure of the accounts and what payrolls have been and how those have moved up. And especially when compared to a year ago when many comp accounts had some fairly significant return premium dynamic. So you're going from a return premium environment to an audit premium plus environment, and that's probably the biggest single driver of the movement in that line.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And from our perspective, it's a good thing.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Yes.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Oh, yes, that's definitely true.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So it's not initially a policy count, it's more of a exposure per unit?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Payrolls. The initial premium is based on an estimate. We're coming down the road. When the policy expires, we do an audit. If the actual payroll was less than had originally been disclosed to us, then we have a return on premium if the payroll turns out to be more than what it was originally disclosed to us, we have an additional billing during the sort of depths of that great recession we were in the return of premium arena as customers shed payrolls far more aggressively than they have anticipated they would. And now they reached the stage where they were flattening out. That brought the audit premium back to 0, and have been growing modestly. And so what we're seeing again is now a change into the build arena of audit premium.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I mean, any change in the competitive dynamic just over a year, just in the larger case market that you've noticed?", "William E. Cunningham", "This is Bill Cunningham. Nothing discernible. I mean, in a large national...", "Jay S. Fishman", "When you say large, let's make sure...", "William E. Cunningham", "You're talking large national accounts less responsive business?", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Like your commercial accounts business, not the small, not the Select or Select Express, not the small and the commercial but kind of the down-the-middle commercial accounts business.", "William E. Cunningham", "I would just say over the course of the last 12 months, some of the crack that you've described, and we have seen competitors pushing price and moving price in another direction in a number of states that we compete with them.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Josh Shanker, Deutsche Bank.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'm sorry, let me -- before I could take that question, let me just -- because Bill used words that we understand here internally. I think what he was saying -- you should correct me if I'm wrong, but I think what you're saying is when you say cracks, what you're seeing is other competitors struggling with workers comp line and not an insignificant increase in rates by other competitors as well. We never deal with other competitors. We get anecdotal observations from agents. But that's what Bill is speaking about, that we're, particularly, in the states that have been more challenging from a loss trend environment where we see other -- we understand, again, trying to -- we never talk you never talk with other competitors about rates in any way but we see them reaching for rate as well in that environment. That's what our comment was.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay. Next question -- Josh Shanker, question, please.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "During the Goldman Sachs Financial Service Conference Call, you dissuaded investors from taking a look at Schedule P. Obviously, now we're going to look at that. But maybe you know more than we do, and if you can walk the math on why our look Schedule P would lead us to the wrong answers, and maybe if you can talk about what your reserve are going to look like when we do that following all of the 2011 numbers?", "Jay S. Fishman", "First, I don't think we ever dissuaded anybody from looking at the Schedule P. I just -- go back to that Goldman Sachs conference and we were talking about the complexity of making, I'll call it somewhat simplistic assumptions based upon kind of overall views. But our Schedule P is going to reveal the things that Brian shared with you earlier. You're going to see the 2010 accident year for workers comp had more claim frequency than we originally anticipated. You're going to see, in the auto liability line, particularly, I guess not particularly, but commercial auto for sure is going to see 10, 9 and -- 9 and 10?", "Brian W. MacLean", "A tiny bit in 8 but mostly 9 and 10.", "Jay S. Fishman", "9 and 10. And I think those are going to be the things that you'll see that -- and that's why we're providing the explanation here today, so that people understand what it is they'll be looking at when they see it.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And then so far from what you're seeing, looking at the beginning of the year of 2011 to where you are today, those things you're seeing in 2010 have sort of reverted to the mean are not showing up this year?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we booked the change into 2011, first of all. In other words, the base year, what we do, we develop loss estimates for a given year. We started out with the immediate preceding year. We'll make adjustments for frequency and severity that we anticipate. So when 2010 had that $94 million after-tax increase in claim activity that I spoke about, we obviously rolled that forward into our 2011 loss estimate, and that's been booked and recorded. As we look to 2012, we obviously are starting out with the base, again. But now you're asking the complicated question, of that $94 million in that year, how much is a timing difference that we see just from one year to the next, and how much is permanent difference? But we certainly are going into 2012 eyes wide open with respect to the 2010 accident year and what its effect was. That gets me back to my comment earlier that the estimated return on allocated capital for comp broadly speaking. I mean, before [ph] across the whole book is at the moment in the low double-digit range, so it's -- and that's incorporating that 2010 development into that.", "Jay S. Benet", "And if I could add a couple of things. I mean, there's a story line that you have to follow in our Q's where we're describing things that are taking place each quarter, some of which, as Jay said, impact us as we look at the business going forward. And that's when we talk about base year movement and our adjustments for current year loss picks and ultimate results for a particular year. There are other things that take place that get reflected in Schedule P that don't impact the numbers going forward. So if you look at some of the property line, as an example, what you'll see is disclosure in our 10-Qs talking about some development that's taking place, one that comes to mind were the Arizona hail storms that impacted us from 2010 where we made loss estimates associated with what we have been seeing. And then in 2011, saw a further development on those losses that get reflected in our property lines. Those are losses that are episodic, and therefore, don't impact us when it comes to looking at loss fix. So we say it's complicated, those are the kind of things that we're talking about. The granularity of information that we go through to make a determination, number one, are our reserves fairly stated at the end of the quarter which are at always best estimate. And then two, what do this information tells us about the past as well as the future and then trying to very granularly and thoughtfully build those into our ongoing analysis.", "Jay S. Fishman", "The important point I think we made the important point on the Goldman Sachs Day was that there seems to be a view somehow that current year reserve adequacy is a function of late. And that concept is just foreign to us. We don't understand it actually. We make estimates of losses and we make those estimates of losses, frequency, severity, and so the notion that we would not be making our best estimate because a couple of years ago, rate was more challenged relative to 5 years ago when it was less challenged. It was just completely foreign to us. We don't get that. So to us, at least, and I'm speaking just for Travelers, the way we establish loss reserves are independent of whatever the rate is, that's being very granularly determined and they are constantly being reviewed by actuaries internally. And you've heard us say, when we make re-adjustments to current year loss picks, current year loss picks, not prior year, it's because we're seeing activity either up or down that was different from what we had originally expected that loss activity to be, so that was the comment. By all means, dig into Scheduled P.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I appreciate, and thank you, very granular answers. Just a quick numbers question. Brian went through the math on personal auto. What is the run rate for this U.S. thing for annual cats per year in the loss ratio, normalized?", "Jay S. Fishman", "In auto?", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "You said you were targeting 96. You got to 98.5, but that doesn't include any normalized cats. So I just want to also get that part. I think, at least, maybe a bit.", "Jay S. Fishman", "No. That -- go ahead answer the question.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Josh. It leads us [indiscernible] really insignificant for the auto side and put this in normal expectation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of questions. One, just to start clarifying. Your 99.5 to 98.5 run rate, was that  Personal Auto Or Personal Insurance?", "Brian W. MacLean", "That was Personal Auto and the delta is the 1 point of pretty clearly identifiable weather-related activity above that pretty low normal activity.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right. And then within FTI, obviously, you've been exiting the personal lines of business in Ireland. You talked about that from a premium standpoint. Just curious whether or not that exit is having any positive impact on the loss ratio, and if so, how much.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I don't know the exact number. It should have a positive impact, but it will be pretty small.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just kind of timing wise, how far are we -- I mean, my sense is there might be one more quarter of kind of cycling through. Is that right in terms of timing?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Maybe 2, but I think the overall personal lines of premium in 2011 was about $24 million, $25 million. It's pretty small and should tell us in the next couple of quarters.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then, I guess, a bigger question, how customers are adapting to the rate increases? Obviously, we know exposures are up on an underlying basis with the economy. Which puts some purchase -- price pressure, at least dollar spend pressure, on customers who are raising rates on top of that. Are you seeing customers either change the limits they're buying? And I recognize not all your customers may have the flexibility to do so, but are you seeing any change in buying behavior? Either limits, deductibles or other things, clients are dealing to try to mitigate kind of the dollar impact on them?", "William E. Cunningham", "This is Bill Cunningham. I would say, we're not seeing any meaningful change in the commercial space on terms of conditions either limits or deductibles. Where we are seeing changes in deductibles would be on the larger property end in wind exposed areas, and that would on the margin, but I would say across the board, clients are opting more for the price increase than a deductible increase. But again, that's largely anecdotal. But the numbers would support that it's more about the price and less about the terms and condition.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Then can you just help, on a written basis, connect the dots between what you reported for rate increases, exposure increases in Business Insurance relative to what we're actually seeing show up on the net line in terms of written premium increases? I mean, I get retentions down, but it doesn't seem to be down relative to the positive push from those 2 things to explain kind of the delta.", "William E. Cunningham", "It's a retention and I would say new business dynamic, the new business being off of it.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I'm not sure I got the question there, Matt. I'm sorry.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, based on your chart, it looks like you're saying Business Insurance pricing are up 6%. It looks like based on your chart, you're showing exposure growth of somewhere between 2% and 4%, which would make the range 8% to 10%. Retention's down 4%, so that takes that to 4% to 6%. And I get new business is down a little bit but that feels more like 100 bps, so I would net-net expected better growth.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Okay. So you got audit premium spread. Why don't you...", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "That was a positive delta year-on-year too, though.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. Right. So if you're trying to reconcile written premium year-over-year, you've got the rate as a big improvement on a full year basis about 5 points. You got 2.5 points of exposure. You got retention down 5 points plus you've also got new retention business, a change in new business.", "Jay S. Fishman", "The biggest driver offsetting the price gains is retention in new business the quarter.", "Brian W. MacLean", "And then you've got audit premium swinging from negative to positives.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe I'll follow up offline because I'm not exactly following.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "I appreciate all the colors and disclosure on the reserve issues both in change. And you really substantial disclosures in your third quarter stat filings, which, I think, are better than a lot of your peers. The one question I'd have basically the follow-up on Josh's conversation and all the sort of talking we've done about workers' comp and commercial and personal auto and the challenges there. Recent past couple of quarters have seen a lot of releases from surety, as well as I think disclosures on your third quarter regulatory filings suggests that the asset funds and the liability, so claims made in occurrence, are funding much of the recent reserve favorable development, as well as -- it potentially sound like you're maybe a UA [ph] reclassification. And I think we use the word episodic before, I'm curious, should investors be looking at these as the sorts of things that we should be plugging into our models for next year as favorable offsets to potentially sort of modest favorable development and going forward in the other lines where we're talking about potential challenges?", "Jay S. Fishman", "This is Jay Benet. We've answered this question a number of times in the past. We, as a management team, have this very, very robust processes each quarter to evaluate, what our reserve changes look like, and to come up with our best estimate of reserves. We have no guidance. We have no views that we would have either internally or to share externally as to how reserves are going to develop. So I think, you, as an analyst, can feel free to think of whatever patterns you've seen, whatever you're hearing from other companies. As Jay said, it's all dependent upon what a company's assumptions are, what the starting point is, what are the loss ratios that they have at this point in time and how things are going to develop. So one company's development can look a lot different than in other companies. But I think you see our history, you see what we've done in terms of putting up reserves in the past, how those reserves have developed. And as I said, our view is we're always at best estimate and you can come up with whatever you view you think is appropriate.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes, that's certainly fair and expected, something like that. Just in the context of sureties, obviously, sort of an episodic, credit-related reserve and then the commentary you guys had suggested around the excess coverage, which is related to favorable traditional environment over the past number of years. And we're just wondering if we should look at this as kind of a onetime thing and maybe you've already answer that so...", "Jay S. Benet", "We're always building in the current view as to how an environment has changed. So if we have certain views of the toward environment, let's say, several years ago that we're driving a certain level of reserves and that sort of environment has improved to date, we'd look at, okay, where is it today and we have some view as to where we think it might go in the future and that would be the basis upon which we reserve. But what we don't do is we don't say, gee there some continuum of improvement. Let's book 1/4 of it now, we'll book a quarter next quarter, and we'll keep -- and keep going. It's always based on facts and circumstances as they exist and it's the best estimate at that point in time.", "Jay S. Benet", "And if you go back in time in our disclosures, what you'll see is the description of what's generating positive development, it's changed. It's been this line or the other line or that year in property or liability, or just -- it's a very big business. We're making estimates for multi-billions of dollars of losses every given year and things just workout somewhat differently than we had originally expected. But it's not as if there is a pattern there that somehow is reliable. It's just changed over the years and different line show up at different times. If we had -- as we said at the Goldman Sachs Day, our goal is to get it right. It's not to -- I know it feels good when you have that favorable reserve development in the period that it's reported, but we're pricing product every day. And if we're going to make the most of what we got, either growing our business or recognizing lost trend or adjusting, the only way we're going to make really thoughtful decisions, really good ones, is if we get it right. So that's our goal. Our goal is to get it right. It's obviously better than -- everybody says favorable, better than unfavorable. But -- and maybe that's true at the moment, but when we have favorable development, that means that we over-costed our product in the year in which -- from the year it relates to, and maybe we could have sold more if we had a different view of costs. So we're very driven to try and get it right.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "Yes, I think that's right. I personally grew up in business always thinking that the right answer is the right answer, and if they could lead you to better decisions, I think you guys, obviously, sort of do a good job of explaining, but we shouldn't count on these things going forward. And so I don't think there's any issues there. If I could just ask one final numbers question.", "Gabriella Nawi", "We'd like to move on to the next question. Thanks. We kind of gave you your tip.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Cliff Gallant with KBW.", "Cliff Gallant - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Just on the investment portfolio. Do you anticipate any changes in strategy? And can you comment on the outlook for the non-fixed income portion of the portfolio, please?", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, no changes in strategy. We have a strategy, which we think accommodates a very wide range of conditions. In terms of the outlook for the portfolio, am I allowed to give an outlook?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we sort of did. Someone else had asked, about the non-fixed income...", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, that was what we expected on an ongoing basis. I think I'm being asked for an outlook for the quarter. So the question is -- I guess, typically, we don't an outlook for the quarter.", "Gabriella Nawi", "That was it?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay. Well, thank you for joining the call. We appreciate the time given that we went a bit over. But if you have any further questions, please contact myself or Andrew Hersom in the IR department.

We're pleased to report a very strong start to 2012 driven by solid underwriting as well as investment results.", "In the quarter, we produced net income of $806 million or $2.02 per share and generated a 13.1% return on equity and a 14.7% operating return on equity. Even excluding the impact of net favorable prior-year development, which states the returns on an absolute year basis, the corresponding percentages are 9.9% and 11.1%. Net income of $806 million compares to $839 million last year, but last year included a $104 million benefit from the favorable resolution of prior-year tax matters.", "As we've shared with you previously, our current operating focus is simple and on course. Given the potential for continued severe weather in the United States as well as the outlook for continued low interest rates, we remain committed to improving our profitability by actively but selectively seeking price increases and improved terms and conditions on the products we sell.", "In Business Insurance, we continued to achieve improved pricing. Renewal rate change in the quarter was a positive 8%, up from 6% in the fourth quarter of 2011, while retention remained stable. Importantly, we believe that we differentiate ourselves from many in the marketplace by not taking a \"one size fits all\" approach to pricing. In our individual underwriting businesses, each customer's needs, characteristics, geographies and risk and loss profile is different, and as such, each transaction is analyzed and priced separately. In Select Accounts, analyzing the returns we earn from our insured\u2019s industry segment in conjunction with the individual insured characteristics is critical to success.", "We continue to leverage what we believe is industry-leading data and analytics to help us optimize rate and retention, that is, achieving higher retentions on our best customer relationships while simultaneously identifying the walk away point for our least-profitable relationships. This differentiation is best evidenced by an analysis of rate and retention by historical loss ratio performance that Brian will share with you later. We're very pleased how we're executing in the field, and this analysis summarize and demonstrates the effectiveness of our analytics and the thoughtful way we're approaching business pricing.", "In our Personal Insurance segment, we continue to take the necessary actions to increase returns, which include improved pricing, terms and conditions. Renewal price change in the quarter improved in automobile and Homeowners to 4% and 10%, respectively. In many states, we have implemented higher deductibles and changes to underwriting terms and conditions predominantly for new business. And while Personal Insurance new business in these states has been and may continue to be impacted for some time following these changes, we are convinced we are on the right course.", "I want to take just a moment to acknowledge the work our financial professional and international groups have done in recent years. Within FP&II, there are numerous businesses and product lines, each with its own individual story, but in the aggregate, we recorded a 24% improvement in profitability quarter-over-quarter and are more comfortable with our risk profile and better positioned for opportunity in our international business than we have been in the past. Additionally, the fact that our surety and Management Liability businesses have performed as well as they have is a real testament to risk management scale, especially given the economic environment over the last several years. The solid work these teams have done and continue to do is evidenced in their strong results.", "Lastly, I'm also pleased to report that our Board of Directors approved a 12% increase in the company's quarterly dividend, raising it to $0.46 per share. This brings our annual yield, based on last night's closing price, up to 3.1% from 2.8%. Since the merger of St. Paul and Travelers in 2004, the dividend has increased each year and, over this time period, has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 10%. As always, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks, Jay.", "I would characterize our first quarter results as being very strong and as having the following attributes: fixed income investment returns that were in line with our expectations; non-fixed income investment returns that benefited from strong equity market performance to the end of the quarter; underlying underwriting results that benefited from the significant price increases we have been achieving in recent months as well as growth in exposures and favorable audit premium adjustments; weather-related losses that were more or less within our expectations; and a relatively high level of net favorable prior-year reserve development. Brian is going to provide comments on our underwriting results, but before he does, let me say a few words about our reserves and their development.", "The strength of our reserves is evidenced by the net favorable prior-year reserve development we continue to experience: $200 million after tax in the first quarter, up from $155 million in last year's first quarter. While each segment once again reported net favorable prior-year reserve development, the Business Insurance segment was responsible for $162 million or approximately 80% of the total. BI's net favorable prior-year reserve development was driven by better-than-expected loss experience in general liability for the 2004 through 2009 accident years and commercial property for the 2010 accident year. Partially offsetting these favorable adjustments was the strengthening of our commercial auto reserves for the 2011 accident year due to higher-than-expected frequency and severity.", "Financial, Professional & International Insurance contributed net favorable prior-year reserve development of $31 million after tax in the quarter, a little higher than last year's first quarter primarily due to the better-than-expected loss experience in our surety business within Bond & Financial Products for the 2006 through 2008 accident years as well as in several lines of business in Canada and Lloyd's.", "Turning to financial strength indicators. All remain in excellent shape. First quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $814 million, a holding company liquidity of $2.2 billion and all of our capital ratios ended the quarter at or better than their target levels.", "Net unrealized investment gains, which were $4.35 billion at the end of the quarter or $2.8 billion after tax, decreased only slightly from year end, entirely due to movements in interest rates and credit spreads, while book value per share rose to $63.81, 2% higher than the beginning of the year and 7% higher than a year ago.", "And finally, as always, we remain fully committed to identifying and returning excess capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned a little over $500 million to our shareholders through common stock repurchases of $350 million and dividends of $162 million.", "Brian is now going to provide further commentary on our underwriting results.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay.", "A great quarter on many levels. And from an underwriting perspective, our GAAP combined ratio of 92.2% was 2.5 points better than 2011, and adjusting for cats and prior-year reserve development, the combined was 94.6% or 1.1 points better than 2011. So a really good start to the year.", "In Business Insurance, we are extremely pleased with our results this quarter. Operating income of $612 million was up slightly from a very good quarter last year, which included a $76 million tax benefit. Pricing continued to be very strong, with renewal premium change of 9% that included pure rate increases of 8%. Importantly, the improved rate that we achieved was broad based, with rate increases in all product lines between 6 and 9 points, with the workers comp and auto lines at the top end of that range.", "Net written premiums were up year-over-year driven by these pricing gains as well as solid exposure growth and audit premiums. By line, the growth was driven by workers compensation, again resulting from price and exposure increases. For your reference, Page 9 of the webcast shows the reconciliation of net written premiums quarter-over-quarter, and we believe this speaks to a picture of improved profitability on the business.", "Retentions remained solid, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2011 driven by improvements in commercial accounts. As you can see on Slide 11, Select Accounts retention has declined from 81% in the first quarter of 2011 to 75% in the current quarter. As we have discussed many times, our select business includes Select Express, the smaller-account-sized business; and Select Plus, the larger individually underwritten accounts.", "In Express, retention has come down modestly and is currently at 78%. In Plus, retention is down much more significantly to 71%. In the Plus business, based on our view of account and segment profitability, the competition has continued to price business very aggressively and at returns we do not consider acceptable. Accordingly, our retention is the result of our active and very deliberate strategy to seek the appropriate price for each account, and we are very comfortable with this volume and profitability trade-off.", "So stepping back to rate and retention for all of Business Insurance, we're very pleased with the results, but importantly, we're also very focused on how we got to those results. By that, I mean, did we get the rate increases where needed? And did we retain our best business?", "An example of how we manage this approach is on Slide 14, which shows our rate change and retention data for commercial accounts segmented by the individual accounts' long-term loss ratio. So the bar on the left represents our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%, and the bar on the right represents our worst-performing accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. You can see that the retention ratio was stronger for the better accounts and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poorer-performing accounts.", "I want to emphasize 2 points. First, our actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on individual accounts. Secondly, that this is -- this exhibit presents summarized data and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level: by business, by product line, by industry and by geography. And the conclusion is we feel great about how we're executing at those levels.", "Turning to loss trend. Across Business Insurance, we are seeing loss inflation at about 4% overall, which is consistent with our expectations. As with the rate story, by line, there's a pretty tight range around that number, with workers comp and auto slightly above the average. Looking specifically at workers comp, the frequency increase we talked to you about in prior quarters has stabilized. And in commercial auto, we continue to see a modest pressure in bodily injury severity and in physical damage frequency and severity.", "So in closing on Business Insurance, a critical takeaway: In the quarter, the earned impact of our pricing actions exceeded our current estimate of the quarter's loss trend by about 50 basis points. And this is obviously a step in the right direction.", "In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we had another very strong quarter, with operating income of $149 million, up 24% from the prior year. The improvement is due to lower level of cat losses as well as improved underlying margins in our international business where we believe underwriting initiatives have resulted in a better balance of risk and reward.", "Looking at production, Management Liability net written premiums were up 7% year-over-year as retention levels and renewal premium gains were at their highest levels in several years and new business volume was also strong. Management Liability is an area where we've made significant investments in technology and analytics, and the increased volume we are seeing shows that those investments are paying off. In addition, we are seeing the most growth in our more profitable lines.", "In surety, volumes continued to be impacted by decreased construction spending, while in international, net written premiums were down $8 million or 3%, reflecting the impact of our decision to exit the personal lines business in Ireland, as well as an increase in ceded premium year-over-year. So all in, a very strong quarter for the segment.", "In Personal Insurance, first quarter operating income, excluding cats and prior-year development, was $176 million, up 5% from the first quarter of 2011. The GAAP combined ratio, also excluding cats and prior year, was 92.3% and, excluding the impact of the direct-to-consumer initiative, 90.3%. So the underlying profitability, the agency business, was very solid.", "Looking at production. In Agency Auto, renewal premium change was 4%, up 1 point from the fourth quarter, and retention remained strong at 83%. In agency property, we also saw improved pricing, with renewal premium change of 10%, up from 8% in the fourth quarter, along with continued strong retention. In both lines, new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing and underwriting actions.", "Loss trends in home have remained within our expectations, while in auto, we continued to see severity pressures that we disclosed last quarter with a slight uptick in physical damage lines. Given the desire to improve auto margins that we discussed last quarter and the possibly of continued unusual weather patterns, we will continue to take the actions necessary to improve profitability in both auto and Homeowners. We've filed for additional rate increases in both products in a number of states. And in Homeowners, we've also continued to implement underwriting changes along with changes in terms and conditions, such as higher deductibles.", "As with Business Insurance, we continually measure the balance between profitability and growth in a very granular way, and we remain very comfortable with our actions.", "With that, I'll open it for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on insurance pricing levels. I know no one said that they've peaked, but they clearly are in excess of loss cost trends in most lines. Are you guys still seeing momentum there? And can you comment on Management Liability? Rates increased 4% there, do you think there's momentum in that specific line of business?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Mike, so this is Brian MacLean. I'll start off. And speaking specifically to Business Insurance, I'd start by emphasizing and repeating what we just said, that we feel good about where the market was this past quarter. And the 8% rate, 9% total price and the retention levels we're getting and, specifically, where we're getting it by account and by type of business, we felt good about. Our position in the marketplace right now as we move forward is, we're not changing our strategy at all. We're looking to continue to prove -- improve our returns. You are absolutely right, that we're now at a point where we're earning in something in excess of our current view of loss trends. And we don't make long-term predictions on the market, but we do have pretty good visibility into what's going to happen 60 to 90 days out. We're obviously quoting business out there and we have a decent view into April. And so we feel good about what we're seeing in the second quarter and, from a written basis, feel that the momentum is somewhat continuing. So we feel very good about where we are.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then lastly, in regards to workers comp frequency stabilizing, could you comment on what level it's -- has stabilized at?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I don't know if we've specifically disclosed it, but it's...", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Would you say it's at a level that's going down in terms of the trend, the absolute level of frequency?", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I think, in the fourth quarter, we've seen it level out. And we really haven't seen a change in the first quarter relative to what we have been seeing, so it's running within our expectations. Nothing has really changed.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, I mean, it's pretty close to 0, is what we're seeing and it's very stable.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And have rates, pricing, has that continued to improve on that line?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. I mean, we've -- workers comp is at the highest end of the price increases we're getting, and we feel good about what we've been able to do there. On the Management Liability side, Alan...", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Mike, it's Alan Schnitzer. You asked about Management Liability pricing, as well. And you mentioned before, the pricing is actually up 2. Overall, RPC is up 4, and 1/2 of that's rate and 1/2 of it's exposure. We are -- it is our strategy to continue to try to get rate in those lines where we think we need it. And just based on our feel for the market and what we're doing 30, 60, 90 days out, we think there's some room for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie Group.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "The first question is on the discussion on retentions. Obviously, the retentions have trended down successively every quarter. And I'm just wondering, if you keep on pushing rates, do we get to somewhat of a low-70s retention number as we approach end of 2012? Or do you think that the retentions numbers are exhibiting some signs of stabilizing, going forward?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so a couple responses to that. This is Brian. I'll start, and then -- let me start by saying that, historically, when we look at retentions in our core Business Insurance, at an 80% level, with the right execution and the right analytics, we feel that -- as a matter of fact, we don't have any doubt that we can perform very well at an 80% retention. We had said consistently, going back a year or so ago when we were running at 84, 85s, that those were at historical high levels and we did not expect to continue to have the business there. So we feel pretty good about where we are today from a retention perspective. As you pointed out, quarter-over-quarter, it went up a blip so fundamentally stable where it is. The other thing I would emphasize back to that exhibit we showed in the webcast: We look really hard at, as retentions move up or down, why they are moving up or down. And to state the obvious, but it's -- the execution on this is critical. If we're retaining our best business and retention is softening in the weaker business because the market -- because we can't get the price increases that we think we need, we're going to be perfectly fine with that trade-off. So we don't sit here with a magic number and say, if it gets to 75, we're at a panic level. If -- whatever. It's really about the composition of what's going on inside of it.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And this is Jay Fishman. I'd just add 2 quick comments. First, just to clarify, in Business Insurance, the retention was actually stable, dead on, first quarter to fourth quarter. So sequentially there, that was actually a tiny bit up. It rounds to a flat number, but it was actually the tiniest bit up. And so sequentially, it is right on. And I'd point also to Brian's comments about the Plus business. There's no question that, if we had a different strategy in Select Plus, the retention could be 5, 6, 7 points higher, but our analysis suggests that, that's not the way to create long-term value. And a lot of -- in many of these market segments, in fact in most, it's an active decision, not a passive reaction. We make the decision of the price-retention trade-off all the time. And the slide that Brian showed that ties loss ratios to retention in rate is absolutely critical in the analysis particularly as you get into a granular level. And we actually -- if you do some quick arithmetic on that slide, what you'll see is the summary of that slide shows an 18-point rate increase against accounts with a historical loss ratio or long-term loss ratio in excess of 90%. That -- the result, the arithmetic result of that is a 14% decline, not a 14-point decline but a 14% decline in the actual loss ratio. I mean, it's meaningful. So it's -- as you have the analytics and the ability to look at your book of business just as granularly as we do, we tend to view the retention as a result of thoughtful, well-executed strategies, not a target or a byproduct that's in effect for us -- on us.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Got it. That's helpful. Just one other question and this is a follow-up to the prior question. In terms of California comp, you mentioned that -- I'm sorry, the workers comp line, you said that the rates were at the highest end of the range. And I couldn't quite discern what exactly the number was, what you were alluding to, what exactly that number is. I think you mentioned the loss costs were 4%. Just trying to understand the delta between pricing and loss cost. And if I understand correctly, what you were suggesting in the prior answer was that, probably, the way you look at it, 2010 was the peak in terms of loss cost. And I know you've discussed that in the past, too.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So let me do a couple things and I'll repeat some of the stuff, just to make it clear. We said 8 points of rate increase between 6 and 9 by line, and comp was at the high end of that. So -- and then on the loss costs, I said 4% across all of BI, with a relatively tight band by product line around that. And comp is at the high end of that. I mean, comp and auto were the 2 lines where we're seeing the most loss pressure and we're seeing the highest rate increases. So we think there's rational behavior there.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And what Brian gave you in rate just a moment ago was the written rate increase. And importantly, he shared with you that the earned effect of the pricing strategy, not just rate but that portion of exposure that acts like rate, actually had an earned impact in the quarter of approximately 50 basis points higher than the -- than our current estimate of loss trend.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right. Now you made a comment and I wasn't quite sure where you were going but that we implied that the fourth quarter was kind of the peak of...", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "No, the 2010. 2010 was the peak in terms of loss trend.", "Gabriella Nawi", "[indiscernible] Amit, this is Gabby. When Brian said the question we had been asked was workers comp frequency, which we were saying was essentially flat. But certainly, that is never implying that workers comp loss costs are flat. Obviously, we've always talked about the severity dynamics to it.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "So is it still going up, overall? Or you think that it's stabilized at this level?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, the question is what is -- that you're asking is, we're not exactly sure what you mean by it leveling. Our -- when you add in frequency and severity and you look at workers compensation -- and I'll say this without checking all the facts, but Gabby can. I think, in virtually every year, that it's a net positive inflation rate on loss costs that, even if severity -- even if frequency has been down, our assumption about the combination of medical inflation and indemnity inflation, both, more than offset whatever the underlying assumption has been even in a declining frequency arena. So our analysis always is that loss costs are always rising year-to-year.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right. And then so the pieces we're giving...", "Jay S. Fishman", "As we've already [ph] said. Sometimes, we get favorable reserve development years later, and lots of you comment on that, where our initial loss estimates turned out to be way too high where, in one year, too low, and it obviously changes. But as we initially set them, we're always contemplating an increase in the inflation dynamic on a combined basis.", "Brian W. MacLean", "And I'll repeat the pieces we had given you, and I think they can get you pretty close. I mean, we just said frequency was about 0 across all of BI. Frequency Plus severity is about 4%, and comp's a little bit above that. So that, I think, gives you the pieces, yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Wanted to just ask about the buyback and the dividends. A very nice increase in the dividend in the quarter, but it looks to me like you -- the combined $500 million in buybacks and dividends was less than operating income. And I just wanted to -- and perhaps you said it in your commentary, but I just want to just reassess, what is the guidance for capital management, going forward? Is it 100% of operating income to be returned to shareholders?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, this is Jay Benet. We try to be as clear as we can about this in our 10-Q. So let me just reiterate a couple of points. First of all, just in terms of the magnitude in the first quarter, we did return, as I said, a little over $500 million, $350 million in the form of repurchases, the rest in terms of dividends. Obviously, we don't know the actual amount of earnings in a quarter until the quarter is over, so we are buying back our shares during the quarter based on some presumption of where we'll be. I'll remind you that, and this is what is written in the Q, the combination of dividends and share repurchases isn't likely to exceed the income for the year. And the share repurchases are also going to depend on a variety of factors. There are capital needs that we have as we grow our business. Maintaining capital levels commensurate with ratings. We do buybacks on the basis of having excess cash available. So we take into account pension funding needs and other corporate needs. So there's lots of things that go into it. And I wouldn't read from any particular quarter the earnings of the quarter versus the amount of the share repurchases as indicative of much of anything at this point.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And then shifting gears, on the core margin side, excellent trends. Everything you're saying is sort of playing out in the reported numbers. The one thing I'm trying to tie, though, Brian, is you mentioned earned premium is ahead of losses -- loss trend by 50 basis points in Business Insurance. And yet, if we're doing our math right, it looks to me like the core margin for that specific unit actually deteriorated by 30 bps year-over-year, which is -- points to a very near-term inflection point for that division importantly. And so I'm trying to tie the \"earned premium to loss\" commentary with the reported number. And I guess the question will be, is there a lag? Or how should we be thinking about that in the models?", "Brian W. MacLean", "And I assume, when you say you're looking at the reported -- if I look at the x cats, x prior-year development combined ratio for Business Insurance, it was 96.4%. A year ago in the first quarter, it was 96%, but importantly, for the full year of 2011, it was 97.9%. So we've got some pretty significant improvement: It's come down 4 consecutive quarters. With all of that said, in any given quarter, there's going to be a lot of stuff that's going to go into the combined ratio that, when I talk about that core margin expansion, I'm not talking about unusual weather, I would -- so I'd be taking out favorable or unfavorable weather, large losses, mix of business changes. We could be moving something in the accident year that's going to distort that given quarter's GAAP combined ratio. So I think, in a specific quarter, there can be a lot going on. Obviously, as we go forward, we're going to speak to those things. But the core underlying margins showed some improvement in the quarter and bodes well for the future.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And while we -- Greg, this is Jay. Thanks for the question. It -- while we don't -- certainly don't want to make predictions about rates or anything else, the one thing that is quite just arithmetic and quite predictable is the effect of written rate because you can go back, you take 1/12 of the previous month, plus 1/12 of the month before that and 1/12 of the month before that and you calculate the rate dynamic, and you can actually calculate the rate impact on premium, the earned rate impact. Now there's a portion that's not nearly as visible to outsiders. There's a portion of exposure that really looks like rate. It doesn't have loss cost associated with it, a change in valuation on a property. So there are elements, so we very granularly go through that. And so on the presumption that, that exposure piece stays the same quarter to quarter, what we can say with reasonable assurance, because things would have to change so dramatically is to be unlikely, is that the earned rate impact in the second quarter, earned rate, will be higher than the first. That's pretty ascertainable at this point. We don't know obviously what our second quarter view of loss trend is, and so it's very difficult to make predictions and feel like you're doing it in any substantive way, but the earned rate impact is really quite discernible.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Keith Walsh of Citi.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Thanks for the slides on retention. Very helpful in the pack. Just getting back to Jay Fishman's comments earlier, on Slide 14. Can you talk a little bit about the elasticity of retention and the trade-off between raising rates on the really good loss ratio business that looks like it's sub-60 versus keeping more of it, retaining more and maybe not raising rate as much?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, that's -- it's -- actually, it's a very good question and it really gets to the core of how we execute in the marketplace. The -- first, in its most simplistic form -- and you all are knowledgeable enough about our industry to understand it: If you get 1 point of rate, 85% of that, I'm taking 15 points of commissions and taxes, direct costs, if you will, fall right to the pretax line. So 1 point of rate is really quite powerful from a profitably standpoint. Now 1 point of retention has dramatically lower impact on profitability because you have all the loss costs associated with it. So you have the variable cost that goes up, but you also have the direct loss cost that goes with it. So it's quite easy to say that 1 point of rate is worth a multiple, 5x. And I'm guessing at that number, sitting here this morning, but 5x 1 point of retention. Now the -- that theory is good until your last account. At some point, it breaks down. But as we sit here looking at 1 point of rate on the margin versus 1 point of retention, that's a really easy call as long as we're being thoughtful about how it's executed. Now I'm going to get back to the slide you referenced. One of the reasons why we don't at all set a corporate mandate for pricing -- and there are some, we believe, companies that do. They say, \"You've got to get x percent on a renewal or you can't renew it.\" Well, what happens is you'll lose your best accounts because they don't need the x percent of rate. And in your least-profitable accounts, you get the x, and it needed twice x. And so while it looks initially like you've done good work, the fact is you've got underlying real adverse selection working against you. So first on the margin, when you're in an improving profitably dynamic, that point of rate versus the point of retention is just such an easy call. On the marginal dynamic, that's an easy one. And -- but importantly, the ability to execute and understand where one draws the line on that chart is just critical to the actual improvement in profitability. Otherwise, you're going to have a whole series of operating dynamics that are going to look great, but unfortunately, it's never really going to translate into improved profitability. So it's the combination of recognizing the trade-off between rate and retention, which again, on the margin, is an easy one, but executing it based upon the history of the account. I'd make one other point with respect to that chart because it's really an important one and it can get lost. This is the long-term loss ratio. So if we -- this is the actual experience of an account up to as much as 7 years, if we have the account that long, because we also understand the premise that an account can be terrific performing over 2, 3, 4, 5 years and then have an unusual loss, an unusual fire. And you certainly don't want to react dramatically to one insured loss. We're in the insurance business, we anticipate losses. So it's not -- we're not looking at a 12-month loss performance here because, again, that would give you a potentially very adverse effect as well. This -- analytics here enable us to look at the long-term profitability of an individual account.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I just want to emphasize. This is Brian again. One other thing I made in my comments generally, but I think it's really important to understand who we are and why we think we can perform the way we do in the industry. The exhibit that we've got is a very simplified view of how we actually manage this. So what we actually use in our operation doesn't just have 3 segments, it has at least 5 by each of our business. So we've got our business separated by quintiles and it's got the long-term combined loss ratio plus a bunch of other factors. So we're not just looking at the loss experience of the account. We're looking at a lot of other things. And we're looking at that by individual business, by industry, by geography. And believe me, when we see the numbers come out, we go, \"Okay, they look okay, they don't look okay, but let's really understand why.\" So your question, again, Jay said it is great, that keeping the best business for the right reasons and taking the right actions on the more challenged business is what we have to do. And at the end of the day, that's going to result in numbers. And if we did the right things, we're going to be happy with what the numbers are.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And I -- while I can't prove this to you because I'm giving you back the reflection of conversations with agents and brokers -- we tend to forget about them in these conversations. There's an agent or broker who represents every single account that we're dealing with here. And that agent or broker understands the market deeply, understands alternatives and choices and flexibility and in the end makes a recommendation to his client based upon the actions that we're taking. One of the reasons, and this just comes from conversation, that agents continue to be supportive of the strategy here is that it's not being applied as a \"one size fits all\" dynamic. When we sit down and have a conversation about an account, it becomes apparent why we're having that conversation. And we're not -- we talked earlier about never -- we're trying hard not to be disruptive to an agent's business or to our insurance business, and that means getting granular enough to understand that the pricing actions fit the individual account and account strategy that you have. And that's one of the reasons why agents can embrace it because they understand what we're doing and they understand the economics behind it.", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And then the second question I just had on Slide 9, the new business number and the revenue roll-forward or the premium roll-forward of $423 million; retention, really good, keeping it stable. It seems like this number is a little more challenged. Does this speak to a more competitive market with lots of capacity for new business? And just how do you -- how does that intertwine with your view on expanding rates, going forward?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Is your question -- I'm sorry, just to clarify, is your question that the new business amount seems low to you?", "Keith F. Walsh - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Yes.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I think we would agree with that, actually. It's really very difficult to -- we remind folks all the time that the profitability of our business and its long-term value-creation is a lot more dependent on how we treat our renewal book than what happens in our new. And the last thing that we really want is for agents to be confused, to find that we're being thoughtful and disciplined in our renewal book but we're being aggressive from a pricing standpoint from new business. I -- and so we recognize, going into this, that it was entirely possible as we became somewhat more urgent about profitability improvement, that the new business levels could very well fall off. Now this is a summary of lots of areas. There are some areas where I think we've overdone it a little bit where I think we could -- I think we've been almost too conservative with respect to new business and we've got to dial up. It gets -- it's not an overall strategy. There are regions where we've got it just right when we look at the numbers and it's working terrifically. And there are others where we've gotten a little too conservative and you want to dial that back just the littlest bit. But I don't perceive it as a comment on the competitive market. I'm sure there's some truth to that, but I think the more substantive dynamic is the approach that we bring to our enthusiasm, our aggressiveness or our conservatism at the point of new business.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Jay, looking at the overall x cat and x prior-year development combined ratio of 94.6%, it's meaningfully improved from any of the 4 quarters of 2011. And I just want to get your sense as to whether we should think of that as the right run rate, going forward?", "Jay S. Benet", "Jay, this is Jay Benet. I think it's -- what Jay and Brian were talking about is the earning end of rate increases that we've been getting over the past 12 months. And when you think about whatever estimates you're making for a loss cost trend, you have to look at the amortization effectively of these written rate increases. And you've essentially seen an upward sloping line of rate increases in that period of time. So just arithmetically, if nothing else changed, if the weather was exactly the same, if loss cost trends were exactly the same, you would just see the combined ratio move in a favorable way based upon that amortization. So we'll see that happens with all the things I just mentioned. But it's not that it's reached a steady state, it's reached a different state than it's been in.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And Jay, I would add that one of the things we're taking for granted here as we're responding is that you understand the impact not only of catastrophic weather, which you immediately pulled out, but small weather, such as we call it around here, has had a significant impact quarter-to-quarter and even has some seasonality to it. It's not just a property loss. We've seen -- traditionally, fourth quarter, there are more auto accidents. We can have a conversation about why that is. And even the fact when there wasn't bad weather in the fourth quarter, there still seems to be some seasonality, so it's not quite as smooth as we'd all like to think. It would sure make it easier for us to manage if it was, but there is some seasonality and movement up and down, so I'd resist the temptation to just say, that's the number and it gets better from here. I have no idea what the next 3 quarters will bring, but I'm sure we're going to be sitting in front of you with some quarter where small weather was either much better than we thought it was going to be or much worse than we thought it was going to be. And that's going to evidence itself in the numbers that quarter.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I see. And my follow-up question is, was there any seasonal influence on the pace of reserve releases in the first quarter? Is there a certain book of business that gets analyzed because that picked up as well versus any of the prior 4 quarters?", "Jay S. Benet", "No. Our reserving processes are very uniform quarter-to-quarter. So this is just getting really the fourth quarter data from last year, analyzing in conjunction with everything else we've known about the reserves and seeing some very favorable movements. As you know, when you're looking at reserve development, you're seeing trends, you have to always determine whether those trends are real or whether there's some anomaly that's taking place. So we do want to make sure that there's enough data that has manifested itself as being real before we make adjustments, but that's something that's going to happen on a quarter-to-quarter basis. There's really no magic about the fourth quarter versus any other quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just have actually one question about -- I know there was a case, a John Mansville (sic) [Johns Manville] case, that was talked about in the first quarter just in the media in an asbestos settlement there. Did that have any impact on the reserve development in the first quarter?", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay Benet. No, we had no change whatsoever in our asbestos reserves in the first quarter or our environmental reserves. Actually, you can see that in all the discussion associated with the litigation and asbestos information.", "Jay S. Fishman", "There's no provision. I'm sure we have paids.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Right.", "Jay S. Benet", "I\u2019m sorry. We had no provision. No incurreds. We did have paids...", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then you -- I assume having asked this before, is -- on the 2010 book, you had some latent frequency, some late-reported claims. And I just wanted to see if we can get an update in terms of, has the late-reported claim activity abated for the 2010 comp accident year? And is it too early to talk about whether or not any of that activity has manifested in the '11 accident year?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So this is Brian. And again, you're talking specifically about comp year. So no, I think that we've seen the frequency dynamic relative to that business level off, and so we did not see any further activity in the first quarter on the 2010 year and are not seeing a similar dynamic through 2011.", "Jay S. Benet", "There's no change of any magnitude of -- in workers\u2019 comp reserves for either 2010 or 2011.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then just last one. It was on the Slide 14, you mentioned -- what is the retention? What has been that sort of trend of retention over time, if you can? And I realize there's a lot of information in that slide, but are you seeing an improved retention of the business you want or stable retention of the business you want as you've taken rate over the past several quarters relative to kind of the retention of the business that you would rather not have that's on the higher side of the loss ratio spectrum?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, this is Brian. I would say, directionally, from a retention perspective, this is pretty consistent what we would say. It's the strongest retentions to the left here, and this one obviously, the middle bar, is slightly higher. But very solid retentions, in the plus 80% and the weaker activity on the far right. So I think, directionally, it's going to be similar.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, what we do from time to time is we look in our management information system for things that we use to manage the business and share them with you. So this is a slide that is prepared for many of our businesses on a monthly basis that we have just compiled for you to see the granularity in which we actually manage it. But it's not something that's showing a different view than what we would previously have had, had we been putting this together for you.", "Jay S. Fishman", "The analytics are not new. The analytics have actually been around for a long time. This is -- particularly just given the rate environment and some of the focus that some of you have had on rate and retention, we thought it would be helpful for you to actually see it and understand how granular you need to be for the strategy to be successful.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matthew Heimermann of JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A couple of questions. First, just on the Page 14 slide. The over-simplistic view of the world might be that you'd expect lower retentions as you go up in terms of the loss ratio bands, but when we look to 60% to 90%, it's a little bit higher than the less-than-60% band. I'm assuming a lot of that just has to do with mix, but would love a little color there.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, it's Brian. I wouldn't overly analyze the precision of the -- which bars are higher. It was meant to be pretty much a representation of something, as we've said over and over, that we actually manage on a much more granular basis. We also don't look at just the loss ratio and the loss performance, so it's -- you've got a lot of other things going on there. As Jay said, it's a long-term loss ratio, so...", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'd actually remind you, because this is I think a pretty good example. We have shared with you in previous quarters, this goes back perhaps a year, that when we bring on a block of new business, what that loss ratio performance looks like and largely through the implementation of our own loss management practice, we're sitting with a group of 750 professionals who are really dedicated to helping our middle-market customers lower their losses. So if we've come into a situation that's not been managed, that we've not had before, it's new and they are engaging with us in loss management practices so that we actually believe that we can help them lower their loss experience in a reasonably short period of time, that will have us have one view of the account versus another kind of account that simply doesn't do it. That's another example of an important variable that goes into what our thinking about price and return acceptability is. We're -- we -- the reason we give you a long-term loss ratio here, how we look at it, is because that's what we're trying to achieve: long-term loss ratio performance that creates real value for everyone, by the way, not just for us but also for the customer. So that's an example of a pretty good variable, an important variable that we consider as we go through the pricing analysis.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, that's fair. I just wanted to make sure I was thinking about it right in terms of -- to the point you just made, there might be business in there you think shifts to a better cohort in terms of loss ratio over time to the actions you think you could take. There could be business in there that is Homeowners in the state of Oklahoma, which probably is suffering from last year, but you're making changes to try to -- I just want to get around some of -- I'm just trying to make sure I'm thinking about some of those things correctly.", "Jay S. Fishman", "You are, although, I'll point out this is just commercial accounts you're looking at. [indiscernible] This is just commercial accounts. So Homeowners Oklahoma, not part of this, but your concept is right.", "Brian W. MacLean", "But your concept is right.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, okay. I could have said small business Alabama instead. Okay, no, that's fair. And then just on the dividend, I guess one of my questions I have is, if cycles have changed, and we've talked about this a little bit in the past, and we're now troughing out at higher levels of -- higher earnings return levels than we would have in the past, how do you change -- you just raised the dividend, but if I kind of look at the new dividend, it's only -- if 2011 accident year earnings with kind of a 3.5% cat load is the right way to think about kind of the earnings base, that would still only represent kind of a high-30s payout ratio, which when you think about historical trough payout ratios or peak payout ratios for all the trough earnings seems pretty low. So just curious how you -- how -- whether or not that impacts how you think about the dividend over time and potentially kind of what a dividend payout could look like.", "Jay S. Fishman", "First, I'll tell you that we analyze it here independent of any cycle dynamics. We just, as I -- we shared with you before, we're not big believers in the concept of some mythical cycle that carries everyone up and then carries everyone down. But the nice thing about our whole capital strategy is that our philosophy is to return it all, is to return all the excess capital, and it's really in a combination of share buybacks as well as dividends. And so we don't perseverate a lot about the payout ratio. We also recognize that you can have a 1 in 500 event tomorrow and then you could have another 1 in 500 event the following week, and suddenly our payout ratio would look real high. So we always stand ready to pay claims, have liquidity, be available to make the payments we need to make and yet have a philosophy of we're not keeping any capital here that we don't think we can use productively. And we could certainly have an interesting debate about whether dividends and share buybacks have preference. And I've talked to many shareholders and I would tell you that it's split about 50-50 as I talk to them. So it's not something that we spend a lot of time, really, dwelling on. As long as we have a competitive yield, an attractive yield for owning our stock and we're committed to returning the rest of the capital, we think we're in pretty good position.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Langen McAlenney.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "On the commercial auto reserve strengthening, you had strengthening last year for that line. It's continuing now. You mentioned frequency and severity. I'm wondering if, given how long this is persisting, whether or not it's become more of a severe -- severity issue on the margin for you guys.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, Larry, this is Jay Benet. The trends that we had been seeing, we factor into our loss specs. And what we saw in the first quarter, based upon the analysis of the fourth quarter results, was a higher level of frequency and a higher level of severity. In the physical damage area, we're just seeing higher costs associated with car repairs. And every time you get more data, you're trying to evaluate what the proper pick is. And in some respects, we're chasing it a little bit. The dollar magnitude is not very much. When you look at what we're seeing in commercial auto as part of the reserve development, it's like $50 million. So don't think -- on a pretax basis. Don't think of this as some very, very large item for us, but like everything else we're doing, we react quickly and decisively to the kind of information we see. And as Brian said, it does impact our pricing as we move forward.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Great, that's helpful. And then can you just give us a little color, if there's any to be had, on your lower advertising spend for your direct consumer? Clearly, the underwriting loss associated with debs [ph] also came down in the quarter. Has -- is   anything changing on the margin with the strategy there?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Larry, no. Our strategy remains the same, and I think this is worth just 1 minute or 2. It's -- we made this investment as a long-term investment, and I'd just start off by saying that none of us feel differently about how we believe our independent agents' personal lines business is going to act. We know the customers we have. We know their socioeconomic dynamics. We know their risk management needs. It's hard for us to believe that, that class of customer is ultimately one day going to really want to take it on himself without someone advocating for choice and alternatives, but we also recognize that we could be wrong. And so we're going to -- we began to underwrite this with 2 concepts. First, a defensive one, which was, if we were wrong about the longer term and we wanted to be positioned to be able to respond. And then offensively, we also saw the possibility. And we do see who the customer is who buys direct, that's one of the real learnings of this. We understand now with real clarity who it is who's buying, that to the extent that change continued could we create a model that would build a successful business around it? And we started with nothing. We started without the technology or people in seats or an understanding or a marketing program. And over all these periods, I can tell you the things that have gone just terrifically. We have a technology platform that's solid and reliable. We have developed a marketing approach that actually does generate response, importantly, things that we learn. We figured, once someone would begin a quote process, they'd finish it. And we learned in the early days, not so. That in our early days, lots of the customers would start and then drop off. That required changes in processes and people and the rest, and ultimately, we now have solved that problem. We're pretty good at getting people to respond. We're pretty good at getting responders to get to a quote. And the next step is to get the quotes converted to sales. And so now, we're talking about not only process but pricing and competitive positioning and how the product is sold and the advice that's given. And we're going to gear our advertising spend now to when there's something to be learned when we're making a change, implementing a process and we've got to see what happens, so we'll go out and we'll be more active and we'll drive activity and we'll be able -- we'll be able to see what comes back at us. If we -- the great risk in all this, and 20 years ago, this happened to us once before, we had a great marketing success but a financial failure. And we're going to guard very carefully not to have that happen. And before we begin to really step down, we're going to make sure that there's a real -- a high likelihood of success financially that we can make the requisite investments, start to do the spending that's necessary to drive more activity and ultimately convert it, not only to sales but to sales that are priced and underwritten that produce an appropriate return. And we're just not there yet. We're not at that level. But we have a talented group of people who are driving the effort. It gets the attention of the senior leadership here. It's 1 of the 2 most strategic initiatives that we have. It's not a backwater activity, it's front and center. I'm proud of what we're accomplishing, but we're not going to make the real bad misstep of being convinced that we're ready to go before we are. So it's just going to be cautious, and we're going to keep learning and we're going to keep going. But I wouldn't read anything into the timing of our spending other than what's tied to the underlying process changes from which we're trying to learn.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Jay, could I add one thing? This is Doreen Spadorcia. And I just wanted to make one other comment. In addition to that, we will have a lumpy spend. It's not going to be a set amount of dollars that you'll see every month. For example, we're looking at local heavy-up in the next few quarters, so you may not even see us on national TV. But in particular states where we know we've got a broad product appetite and match, we'll be in those places. In addition, we are spending quite a bit of time on digital marketing. Again, things you might not see and the cost structure might be different but very targeted, again, to the kind of customer that we match with so, again to Jay's point, that we can push that conversion rate up. So you just won't see probably big national spends, but we are doing marketing. Thank you.", "Operator", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Gabriella Nawi for any closing remarks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good. Thank you, Tina. Thank you for joining us all today. As always, Andrew Hersom and myself are available in the Investor Relations department for any follow-up.

Welcome to the Third Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Thursday, October 18, 2012. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2012 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions. Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we report a very strong third quarter. Net income was $864 million or $2.21 per diluted share, producing a 13.6% return on equity. Operating income was $867 million or $2.22 per diluted share, a record for the quarter for operating income per share. Operating return on equity for the quarter was 15.5%. Our earnings were driven by superior underwriting results, as well as solid investment income.", "From an underwriting perspective, we benefited from lower weather-related losses, net favorable prior year reserve development, as well as the cumulative effect of rate gains we have achieved over nearly 2 years.", "In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, written rate increased to nearly 8% with retention increasing as well to 81%. In Personal Insurance, renewal prices increased in both Auto and Homeowners to 9% and 12%, respectively, while retentions remained stable. Also in Personal Insurance, we continue to execute on improving terms and conditions, along with pricing, and while we are experiencing lower new business volumes, we are taking the right actions in order to improve our profitability and returns.", "In FP&II, rate increases continued to improve in our Management Liability businesses, reaching 6% in the quarter while maintaining stable retentions. We continue to be pleased with the execution in each of our segments.", "While we are encouraged by the success we are having executing our granular pricing strategy, I'll remind you that it is not just about the headline numbers, that is what is happening underneath the numbers is the real story. Our success is premised on really understanding which accounts or lines are in need of improvement and which ones meet or exceed our expectations.", "Brian will take you through Slide 13 in more detail, but the conclusions from this slide are positive. We initially showed you this analysis several quarters ago as an illustration. It is a very summarized look at what we do at a very granular level, and it is also important that you understand that loss ratio performance is only one of the metrics we use to manage our portfolio. And even on this very summarized basis, the analysis demonstrates real progress. It is the package of analytics that we deploy that is illustrated on Slide 13 that gives us the confidence that we will get the right combination of rate and retention on the right accounts that will translate into increased profitability.", "As we've said before, we remain committed to taking the steps necessary to improve returns. This means leveraging our data and analytics across all of our businesses to underwrite and price each of our products very thoughtfully. We continue to assume that our operating environment has changed. Notwithstanding the benign weather we saw in the third quarter, Mother Nature seems to be increasingly unpredictable, and we believe the low interest rate environment will continue to impact our business for the foreseeable future. Therefore, we will continue to seek improved pricing and take those underwriting steps necessary to improve profits and produce higher returns on capital. This remains business as usual for us.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Let me begin by echoing Jay's comment, the third quarter operating income of $867 million and operating ROE of 15.5% were very strong, and along with the timing of certain payables, drove extremely strong operating cash flows of $1.5 billion for the quarter.", "As Jay indicated, third quarter operating results benefited from a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses when compared to both the prior year quarter and to what we would consider normal for the third quarter, as well as a significant amount of net favorable prior year reserve development. Operating results also continued to benefit from earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in 2 of our segments, Business Insurance and Financial, Professional & International insurance, as well as a relatively low level of large loss activity. In addition, our investment portfolio had another quarter of solid performance, driven by real estate partnership and hedge fund returns, and the non-fixed income portion and fixed income investment returns that are in line with our expectations.", "Another item I would like to mention is that our net favorable prior year reserve development included an addition of $114 million after tax on a net basis to our asbestos reserves. Coincidentally, the same amount added to our asbestos reserves on a net basis in the prior year quarter. On a gross basis, the current quarter's asbestos reserve addition was actually $24 million less than in the prior year quarter.", "Although the underlying asbestos environment remains essentially unchanged from recent periods, payment trends have been modestly higher than we had previously anticipated, resulting in a need to modestly add to these reserves.", "Turning to financial strength. All of our indicators remain in excellent shape. Holding company liquidity of $2.04 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio now stands at 21.9%, down from 23.4% at the beginning of the year and well within its target range.", "Net unrealized investment gains ended the quarter at $5.08 billion before tax, increasing by over $500 million during the quarter, while book value per share rose to $67.81, 9% higher than the beginning of the year and 11% higher than a year ago. And during the quarter, we returned $529 million to our shareholders through a combination of dividends of $179 million and common share repurchases of $350 million, bringing our total dollars return to shareholders to $1.57 billion year-to-date.", "I should also note that due to the strength of our year-to-date operating results, we have generated more excess capital than we have returned to our shareholder so far this year, which is strictly a matter of timing. Our strategy of returning all excess capital to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and common share repurchases remains unchanged.", "As such, we expect that the dollar amount of our common share repurchases during the fourth quarter will be somewhat higher than the $350 million quarterly run rate of share repurchases we have been doing in recent quarters.", "With that, let's turn to Brian.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. So very strong results. And from an insurance operations perspective, I believe there are 3 key takeaways that apply across all 3 business segments: First, we're really pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy to improve margin, both in the quarter and year-to-date; second, given the interest rate environment, the weather volatility and loss trend, we need to continue to execute on this strategy; and finally, we see opportunity for better results in those areas of our commercial business that are at the lower end of the return spectrum and in the case of Personal Insurance, where weather losses have been most challenging.", "With that, let me go to the specific segment results. Beginning with Business Insurance. Operating income was up 85% year-over-year with catastrophe losses lower and favorable prior year development higher. Excluding these impacts, operating income was $549 million, up nearly 36% from the prior year quarter and the combined ratio improved more than 6 points. The strong results this quarter were driven primarily by earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trends and lower non-cat weather-related losses.", "Looking at the production statistics starting on Page 9, we saw renewal premium change, pure rate and retention all increased in the quarter. Renewal premium change was 9.3%; rate, 7.8% and retention was above 81%.", "The rate progress that we continued to achieve was broad-based with increases between 6% and 10% across all lines led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. These increases in pricing, along with the growth in exposures and audit premiums helped to drive net written premiums up 5% year-over-year.", "New business was somewhat lower in the quarter as it has been for the last several quarters. Over time, pricing on the new business we've written has improved. But given our strategy to improve margins, we remain very comfortable with the volume tradeoff.", "We're obviously pleased with the aggregate production results, but are even more pleased when we look at our execution on a more granular basis. Slide 13 shows our renewal rate change and retention data for Commercial Accounts for both the second and third quarters, segmented by the individual accounts long-term loss ratio.", "We have shown you this data before, but are now adding a comparison to last quarter. The bars on the left represent our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios of less than 60%. And the bars on the right represent our worst-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%.", "For context, the bulk of our business is in the less than 60% loss ratio band, while about 15% falls in the greater than 90% band. You can see on the slide that for our best-performing business, rate has held steady while retention improved modestly from the second quarter. In the middle tier, rate improved over 2.5 points while retention increased nearly 5 points. And for our worst-performing business, rate increased over 1 point to 18% while retention improved slightly.", "What this data tells us is that we're doing a great job of retaining our best business, improving the profitability of the middle tier and that we have an opportunity to potentially get higher rate increases on our poor performing accounts. So as we've said many times, it's not a one-size-fits-all strategy and you can see that very clearly in this data.", "As you evaluate the slide, it emphasizes several points: First, actual pricing and underwriting decisions are made on an individual account basis and include many additional dimensions beyond loss ratio; second, the exhibit presents highly summarized data, and we actually measure and manage our performance on a much more granular level by business, product line, industry and geography; and finally, key to this analysis is our ability to measure returns on allocated capital at the individual account level for these individually underwritten businesses.", "Slide 13 focuses on Commercial Accounts, which is our largest individually underwritten middle-market business. But our focused pricing and underwriting approach also applies to our commercial flow business, Select Express, which is the small account end of our Select business. If we were to display the Select Express business in a similar fashion, as we did for Commercial Accounts, you would get a broad array. In terms of loss ratio, the CMP product would be in the middle tier. And similar to the middle tier for Commercial Accounts, we're improving profitability in the case of Select Express with renewal premium change on CMP in the mid-teens.", "Our monoline Commercial Auto product within express, which is less than $100 million of written premium, would be at the poorer performing end of the spectrum. And so where our data analytics suggest for the Select Express book, we are focused on underwriting and pricing actions. Again, this is another example of how we apply our powerful analytic tools to drive superior results.", "In the Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, we once again posted strong results with operating income for the quarter of $180 million. This is down year-over-year due to a lower level of favorable prior year reserve development. In Bond & Financial Products, net written premiums were down just slightly quarter-over-quarter as the continued decrease in surety volumes was partially offset by higher volumes in our Management Liability business, notably in those areas that are producing higher returns.", "In Management Liability, renewal rate change, which came in at 6% for the quarter, has increased sequentially in each of the last 5 quarters. It also increased from month to month within the quarter. Management Liability retention was a strong 86% in the quarter.", "In International, net written premiums were up 24% or $66 million on a constant currency basis. 1/3 of that is due to lower surety volumes in Canada and our exit from personal lines in Ireland. Nearly 1/3 is due to policies that were written last year with terms of around 18 months and so they didn't come up for renewal in the quarter, and a smaller piece or about $12 million is due to disciplined underwriting in our businesses in Lloyd's in Canada. The risk and reward work we've done in international continues to pay off as the underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably.", "In Personal Insurance, results for the quarter benefited from a year-over-year decrease in the level of catastrophe losses along with an increase in favorable prior year reserve development. Excluding cats and PYD, operating income of $190 million was up 23% from the third quarter of 2011. This increase, along with the related improvement in the underlying combined ratio is largely attributable to favorable non-cat weather.", "As we seek improved returns in this segment, we are particularly pleased with the significant pricing gains we continue to achieve in both Auto and Home. Auto renewal premium change was 8.7% for the third quarter, up over 3 points from the second quarter, while Homeowners was up over 1 point to 12.4%.", "Turning to Auto margins. We've achieved a meaningful written rate increase over the past few quarters which are just beginning to earn in. In terms of loss trend, severity continues to run at mid-single digits, while frequency, when mix adjusted, is about flat. So we're pleased with the progress we've made to this point but see the need to remain disciplined in our pricing strategy going forward.", "In Homeowners, the story continues to be about weather. Roughly 60% of our loss dollars in Homeowners are driven by weather. So obviously, frequency and severity trends for this line are also driven by the weather. Because of the volatility in weather, in addition to the 12% renewal premium change that we achieved in the quarter, we continued to aggressively pursue terms and conditions changes that both reduce risk and improve returns.", "The rollout of these modifications is ongoing, but our progress to date has been substantial. In the last 12 months, we've made underwriting guideline changes and increased deductibles in more than 40 states. So we feel good about the progress, but we see the need to continue to push these levers going forward.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Andre, we are ready to start the Q&A session. And if I could please ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I was wondering if you could provide a breakout of the reserve release by business line within the commercial line. So the $208 million outside of the A&E, just wondering where that broke out and specially with Worker's Comp, wanting to see if that was net redundant and especially in recent accident years.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, this is Jay Benet. So we look at what's taking price in terms of reserve development in Business Insurance. As we said, it's net about $41 million. And if we look at the components of that property as a big component, if we look at favorable loss development, where did it come from, the recent accident years, 2011, was a big driver of that. And we also had some better salvage and subrogation recoveries in some of the older years than we had expected. Some other areas, CMP, same sort of thing in terms of the property-related items. Worker's comp actually developed a little favorably mostly due to some of the tabular claims that we had for accident years 2010 and prior. We had some strengthening of Commercial Auto given some of the claim severity that we've been seeing in recent accident years that we've been talking about. But net-net, as you saw, everything was on -- was favorable.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And I guess, I mean, did that -- I appreciate the color. I mean, so the Worker's Comp was stable, which is, I think, unique to Travelers. But kind of stepping back, I mean, how should we think about where the reserve trends going overall. For the industry overall, I think, the expectation is that redundancies would diminish. Travelers has had an excellent reserve result. But as this goes forward, should we think of this redundancy as winding down?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We don't make any predictions whatsoever about where our reserve development is going. We make our best estimate every quarter and we stand by that. And then, as the data develops, as more information comes in, we adjust the reserves accordingly.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "And just one more on comp and then the accident year '11, was there -- was that also favorable or was that deficient?", "Jay S. Fishman", "In the quarter, it was essentially breakeven. It was a tiny bit -- we had a tiny bit of strengthening in the 2011 accident year in the third quarter. It was under $10 million. So this is kind of the quarterly analysis that we do to get things right and effectively given the size of the reserves, we're talking about rounding them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "The underlying combined ratio improvement within the BI segment clearly very healthy. Can you provide any color on which lines of business within the segment are exhibiting the most and/or least margin improvement?", "Brian W. MacLean", "This is Brian, Mike. I would say it's pretty broad based. As we've said, comp and auto have been getting the most rate increases, but the range across the lines is 6% to 10%. So everybody is getting some significant rate. As Jay Benet just mentioned, Auto is one of the lines we're seeing a little more heat, so we need the rate there. But I think that by and large, it's been really across the board with our products.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. In terms of -- if you're getting -- what kind of rate increase are we getting in commercial auto then? Because it seems like we've been -- it feels like you guys have been getting healthy rate increases for a while now and you're still talking about margins not being that great in that line.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. I think about 9. Yes, 9 points in auto and comp was around 10, so those were at the top end of the spectrum. Which I think it's consistent with what we've shown in the past. We've talked about and others have talked about the bodily injury trends in the auto business, both commercial And Personal. And so that's been one of the reasons why we're getting those increases.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then as a follow-up in regards to rate increases across all of the segments. Is there a dynamic of stronger momentum in some of the longer tail lines that are more impacted by the low interest rate environment? And are you at all surprised at how well retention is holding up in the face of the rate increases?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I don't think there's any -- yes, obviously, as anybody looks at the economics of the product, the longer tail lines which would be more significantly impacted by the investment yields, that factors into how we think about it. I'm not sure it factors into how the customers think about it, so we work at it. And on the retention thing, I would go back to our comments on Slide 13. So we're obviously pleased that aggregate retention is going up, but it's really the texture underneath that we obsess about and are we keeping the right accounts. So honestly, I'm not really surprised that we've been able to execute in a way where we're keeping the best business. And...", "Jay S. Fishman", "And certainly -- it's Jay Fishman. And while the interest rate environment certainly plays a meaningful role in the evaluation, it is just one factor. And I'd make an observation that our Worker's Comp portfolio, broadly, and of course you can get different conclusions in different businesses, but broadly speaking, has actually been doing better. I'm not sure, Brian, how you might characterize it, better than what we perceive the rest of the industry to be or it just hasn't been -- it hasn't been in a situation where the rate need there has been enormous. I'm not sure how to exactly characterize it. But we're starting from -- we're starting from a position in Worker's Comp that was not as problematic as, I think, sort of conventional wisdom might have thought.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, you can look at our line results for a good number of years, and our performance in Worker's Comp has been significantly better than the industry. We think that's due to a lot of things. Risk selection. We think our claim model around medical management is the best in the business and all that stuff really matters.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, Gabby hosted an Analyst Day where there was a considerable amount of time spent in the nuts and bolts of Worker's Compensation management. And really, I think demonstrated clearly, or at least attempted to demonstrate clearly, the real competitive advantages that we bring to the Worker's Compensation line. So again, it's not that we're -- we are just not all in the same situation or the same environment. And so I'd resist the temptation to just leap to the conclusion that long really needs help and short doesn't. It's just more -- unfortunately, more complicated than that.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I agree that you guys did demonstrate very well that you have guys have a best-in-class Worker's Comp business at Travelers at the Investor Day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore Partners.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "You guys have done a great job of taking rates pretty significantly. Just curious what you're seeing so far in the fourth quarter? And the reason I asked is because, you've taken rate starting fourth quarter of last year. So I just wanted to see if you're successful in getting significant rate on rate.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Vinay, this is Brian. Let me take a shot and I'll start with, we say it all the time, but we're not prognosticators here. We're not going to guess at what's going to happen in the future. I'd point to 2 things. Number one is what we saw in the third quarter, we were encouraged by. So the results that we were able to post, the texture underneath the results, and the dynamic and the feedback that we've gotten from our agents and our customers. Anecdotally, as we look at what we're working on in the fourth quarter, because we've obviously got some view of that but it's anecdotal, is similarly encouraging. So we continue to see a little bit of progress here. And at the end of the day, whether it will be up a little or down a little, we don't know. But the anecdotes right now feel pretty good. But we're also real cautious. The world can change in 30 days, and we'll see where we are at the end of the next quarter. But that's our mood right now.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, fair enough. The second question is, how much of a benefit that you guys get from low non-cat weather? I think you mentioned that it was slightly below normal this quarter.", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I think, when you take a look at what's taking place in Business Insurance as an example, you see a very strong increase -- I'm sorry, increase in profitability, decrease in the combined ratio. And it's difficult to split out the components on an exact basis, but I would say this, at least, a couple of points in there, where favorable non-cat weather has influenced us. And I think, if you go over to PI, you've got the same kind of result. I don't know if it's couple of points or not, but certainly working its way through and seeing some heads nodding around the table. So I think, a couple of points is probably right.", "Jay S. Fishman", "But it's a very -- it's truly a guesstimate because you're asking us to compare a level with whatever we thought normal might have been. And I don't know that we know normal compared to anybody else. So it's a challenging question to answer. And again, because you're asking for what was your experience relative to what you thought the experience would be, I don't know if what we thought was the right number to begin with. So that's the complexity.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Vinay, let me -- it's Brian, let me give you a perspective at what you might be looking for, which is the margin expansion in BI, we think, was about 2.5 points of the combined ratio. So the price over the earned rate over the loss trend dynamics. So -- then the rest has got non-cat weather, it's got other stuff that always -- large loss movement that goes through the quarter, et cetera.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford & Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So in the Q, you seem to be guiding to -- for a continued pricing in the fourth quarter in 2013, and I'm trying not to be redundant in the last question. But we're all trying to figure out how pricing -- how long pricing lasts. And I'm wondering, 2 questions -- well, I'll ask them first and you guys can respond as 1Q. First, when you're actuaries do indication analysis, how much more -- what's the output of that? How much more rate do you think you actually need to get to target accident year, sort of ROEs and target accident year returns? And then separately, Brian, I'd love to just follow up, you made the point about sort of visibility to a pipeline, obviously, you have the sense of what's going on in sort of actual production that you haven't yet reported. But you also obviously have to file rate increases and -- across probably what, 30% or 40% of your business, at least, where that's primarily sort of driving the rates you end up charging. And I'm wondering if you can give us a sense of actually what's in the pipeline and what you think you'll be effective in written rate levels in the fourth quarter or '13 as we look forward.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Josh, it's Jay Fishman, I'll take the first part of your question. We have not set a goal, a threshold number at which we stop. And it's driven by the fact that the environment remains really unpredictable and somewhat volatile. Not only do you have the weather dynamic, and obviously the interest rates which are -- at least, the interest rate portion is quantifiable. But you've also got the uncertainty of the fiscal cliff and what happens to the economy and all the factors around it. So for the moment, what we've decided to do is to continue to business it -- continue on business as usual, continue to pursue what we're doing because we know that to produce the kind of returns I think investors will come to expect, we need to do more. So that's honestly, as far as we've gone, which is we're going to continue to do this and we'll see how we do. And I have no idea what the competitive environment will be or what will happen to us. It is nonetheless a very competitive environment and remains fragmented. All we can do is tell you what we're intending to do for the next -- for the near-term outlook. I don't even want to go beyond that. All I want to do is to say in the near term, this is what we're going to do and we'll evaluate how successful we are and do the data and analytics continue to show us that we're doing the right things and on the right track. And we just don't have that goal line to say, we're X months away from hitting it. It's just -- we just don't have it, and that's really all we can say on it is business as usual, and we're going to keep going.", "Brian W. MacLean", "On the filings perspective, you could -- someone could go and pull them. I would say on the personal line side, we don't have any real big filings in the works that are going to change where we are today. So we took a pretty good bump up in Auto and that was because some things kicked in, in different states and so a little bit of steady as she goes there. In Select, we've recently put in some filings, which are just becoming effective. And so we've got some momentum maybe there, and those would be the 2 big places where we've got filed rates.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Where filings matter. In Commercial Accounts, really it's not a file environment, we're really doing -- wrestling with that. And I'll just kind of revert back to Brian's comment about the anecdotal observations. It's still pretty early in the quarter. And so what we're getting is feedback from our folks in the field who are in agents' offices every day, renewing accounts and having conversations and getting a sense of what the market is. And the anecdotal feedback -- and I wouldn't overemphasize it because it's -- it can change. First of all, it might not be right, it might not be accurate of the real environment and it might change. But the anecdotal feedback that we're getting is -- continues to be so far, so good. And so it's encouraging and gives us a basis for saying, we're going to continue. That's -- it's about as good as we can do right now for you.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So Jay, not -- just to paraphrase, make sure I get it. So basically looking out over your guys' planning horizon, you're not going to give a target, of course. But ultimately, you're going to march to your own drummer, raise pricing, sort of get to continued levels and the market's going to what the market's going to do, but you're going to drive to sort of continued pricing momentum along the lines you've been doing thus far in 2012.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, what I'm -- what we don't want to do is to tell you that with certainty that we're going to succeed because I don't know. It's just -- it's been environment where every company decides its own strategies and has its own conversations with agents and brokers about individual accounts. So all I can tell you with some degree of certainty is in the near-term how we're going to act. That I can tell you because we drive that. How the market responds and how competitors perceive the marketplace and what they do is well beyond our control. The data that we have from the third quarter is encouraging that we're not hitting some wall. The important thing -- the question that I asked definitely here is, are we achieving what we're trying to achieve in the market? A lot of your -- not your questions, particularly, but many of the questions that we get seem to be, are we asking for 20 and getting 8? Or are we asking for 8 and getting 8? And that actually is a relevant question and it really -- we're not trying to get 20. We're not attempting. We've always said from the beginning of this that it was going to be disciplined, thoughtful, account by account, loss driven, evaluated in the context of interest rate changes, thinking about weather, and most importantly, nondisruptive, nondisruptive to our agents and our brokers and our insureds. We're trying to manage a business and relationships. This is not a trading account. It's real people with real businesses, paying real bills and real agents that stand between us, and we're just trying to manage this thoughtfully, gently, doing what we need to do to make sure our business remains viable and has substance to it, but not doing it in the way that causes disruption. So again, I look back at the third quarter, the data all says we're making that happen and gives us a basis for saying, let's keep going.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I guess, one question I have is when you look at your profitability and kind of what you've talked about from here, what do you think is more important or how would you kind of prioritize the rate actions you're taking versus the actions you seem to be taking on the loss management side? And where do you think the industry is on those measures, whether it's terms and conditions or infrastructure to help kind of push down claim cost? And just one follow-up.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Brian and I are going to split this. I think if you looked at Business Insurance, our strategy is predominantly rate driven. We've always been a company that's been actively engaged, helping our insureds manage and lower their losses. We have a substantial risk management group. They are involved and always have been with our insureds to try and help them manage their losses and do better business for them. So that's -- our dynamic in Business Insurance really price driven, rate driven. In Personal Insurance, underwriting terms and conditions play a much more significant role, and I'm going to let Brian speak to that.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, I mean, and I'd say clearly, personal line heavily on the Homeowners side. And to some degree, more broadly property all around. But the place where terms and conditions are really important is our Homeowners' book. And just to give you a perspective. Industry deductibles in the '70s were typical average $250, maybe a $500 deductible. Now the average is probably a $500 deductible. If we just kind of loss inflate that over the 40 years, we think the average deductible should be somewhere around $2,000. So the product has changed. So we're driving deductibles. We've actually been pretty successful historically in getting deductibles on the coastal hurricane exposed, so that's not the issue. The issue has been the inland tornado, hail exposed and we're making real progress. And so there, that's important. The other dynamic is underwriting, and a lot of that is around roofs. So age and quality of rood is an important underwriting decision now on time reporting, on claims and is different in the policy in a lot of places than it was before. So all of those pieces really matter on the property side.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And our hope in deductibles, by the way, is not unique to loss mitigation, that's an important part of it. But we also believe that customers shouldn't be buying more insurance than they need, right? Insurance should be to protect for catastrophic events. And we would encourage all insureds to not pay for more insurance than their own capacity to deal with losses would suggest. And so part of this is not, again, not just loss mitigation important, but it's also to make sure that we're doing the right things for our customers even if they don't always see it exactly that way. It's a $500 deductible today becomes a policy that responds to a lost iPad, and it just isn't the way a homeowners policy was really designed to be.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And just one question on the directors. I know we haven't talked about it a lot recently. But I mean, it seems they kind of be floating along in terms of premiums are growing a little bit, the drag on, the combined ratio is about flat, looks like 5% to 7% of earnings right now. And what is the strategy there? I mean, it's -- you've kind of been in this state for a little while. At some point, would you look at trying to get -- purchase something to help kind of build that platform? Or is it -- or is building it still kind of the expectation?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we have been and continue to be in the test-and-learn phase. It's -- and I don't mean test. What I'm talking about is testing in the very specific dynamics of building the business, whether it's how you get customers to respond or how you encourage a high conversion rate from response to quote. And then most importantly, how do you generate sales from quotes, and that gets to not only the technology or interactive behavior at a call center, but also to the pricing structure. And so we're still in the phase of doing what we need to do to gain the learnings necessary to launch, in effect, sometime down the road a successful business. This is not yet launched. We are still in the test-and-learn arena and we have more work to do in that regard. We're going to resist the temptation. We've done it -- I've certainly in the old, old Travelers days, have been involved into one where we launched a program way too early and had a marketing success and a financial disappointment. And that's a real problem. And so we're going to resist the temptation to do this early. There are always young customers coming along. There's -- it's not as if there's a finite group of customers and they're there. And once they have insurance, they're gone. We all get a day older every day, and there's always another group of customers that are emerging, that are getting drivers licenses that become young adults that need to buy insurance. And so as we think about it that way, we're more than willing to be patient and do it right. More important to do it right than to do it quick and fix as we go. So that's where we are.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And to the timeline from here is just kind of as it develops. And do you feel like you're getting the learnings from it to kind of offset the cost that you're investing in it? And I'll stop.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we're certainly learning whether it offsets the cost or not ultimately depends upon whether we conclude that we have the ability to launch a successful business. I mean if you're asking, do we think that, that's still -- are we still on track to do that? The answer is, yes, but nothing is ever certain. And the real question that we're down to now, as we've said this repeatedly, we are charging the same price in our direct channel that we charge in our agent channel because it is the only price that we know. And the real question is going to be, in that kind of framework, can we actually write a policy, underwrite a risk and produce a reasonable return based on that, whereas, there's some other pricing structure that's going to be necessary? And it's going to take us some time to figure that one out. If we end up concluding that we have everything that's necessary to build a business, yes, we will recover these costs. If it turns out that we ultimately conclude we can't, then unfortunately, we won't. So the substance of your question is, is a challenge to answer, but I -- but we still feel pretty good here. The people working on it are first-rate people. They -- one of the things, and I've said this before, I used to think this was an insurance business. It actually is a lot more about human dynamics and technology management than it is about insurance. And it took a little time for us to even understand that. I think we've got people from outside the insurance industry with real expertise in this arena, and we are learning a lot, really a lot, and we're hopeful is sort of where it stands.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I wanted to touch base on 2 items. The first is the exposure growth in Business Insurance. Based on what you sort of see as the forward-looking indicators, to what extent might that pick up over time?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We're looking at each other here trying to figure out what do we know in the data and what do we see. It's -- first, one of the things we have learned is that notwithstanding the fact that intuitively, we keep thinking that the exposure data is going to turn out to be predictive of the overall economy, and we've spent some time trying to actually link those up and in effect, build an index around it. It's just not nearly as predictive as we might hope. If you look at the data broadly, I think what you would characterize it as is sluggish growth. Now those are words against some numbers, but that's kind of what we see. Now it's -- we should be careful not to confuse the dynamics that we measure in exposure to GDP. We're measuring payroll, we're measuring projected sales, we're measuring trucks on the road, we're measuring real estate square feet. And as we all know, you can have recoveries that have -- jobless recoveries, not my words, words other people have used. And so our data suggests sluggish is what you'd see, but I'd be careful to link that up to a conclusion about GDP. It's not nearly as predictive as we might have hoped.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. Next issue, on the return of capital. I think in the past, Travelers has talked about returning, in terms of the combined share buyback and shareholder dividend, having that equal to around 100% of operating income. And I think, on track year-to-date, it's around 75%. So based on the commentary that, that will probably be higher in 4Q versus 3Q, I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you feel confident that could get closer to 100% as we think about next year.", "Jay S. Benet", "Jay, this is Jay Benet. As we said, we do these things based upon expectations. And thankfully, we have a good problem that our earnings were stronger than our expectations, so we created excess capital. So it really is a matter of timing as to when we repurchase shares. The expectation, as we said, for the fourth quarter is to do something higher than what we've been doing on a run-rate basis for the first 3 quarters. And as we say in our disclosures, there's lots of things that go into that decision. There's capital that we need to support the growth of the business. There's capital that we perhaps need or cash that we need to deal with what's taking place in the funding of our pension plans. I might add that we don't have a very large outstanding pension plan given the history of the company. But when you have interest rates as low as we have today, we want to make sure that the thing is properly funded against the assets. So we'll look in all of that, but at this point, what we could say is that we have created the excess capital beyond what we need at this stage and we haven't bought it back at the same rate, so we will be increasing it. And over time, which I think is really the critical phrase, over time, it will be the earnings that will drive the amount of capital that we return to shareholders, both in the form of dividends, as well as the share repurchases.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "All right. And I just want to clarify a prior response. I think there was a question about pace of rate increases in BI in 4Q. Now you were saying roughly similar to 3Q, and I just want to clarify that, that using the 7.8% rate increase that was in 3Q is sort of the baseline.", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, no. You've misheard that, I'm afraid. We were asked the question and we said, we don't make predictions and we're certainly not prognosticating on rate gains. What I think Brian said was that the anecdotal feedback and that's all it is, it's not data, it's just anecdotal feedback just suggests so far that the fourth quarter is, so far, is sort of looking the same way the third quarter did. Don't over read that. There's no precision in that comment other than conversation. That's all it is. But if we had heard from people out in the field that something substantive had changed, that there'd been some meaningful difference in the environment, that I think is important. We've not heard that. We just heard, yes, it's about the same. Now it's going to be a matter of what accounts actually come up for renewal, what's the mix, where on that grid do they fall, what lines of business. So no predictions whatsoever. And all we were doing there was providing the anecdotal feedback that fourth quarter is sort of so far, so good. Bill is -- I'm looking at Bill and asking him to nod, yes, and he did. So that's where we are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One clarifying question was just, I think, it was Brian who said about 250 basis points of kind of core margin improvement year-on-year. And obviously, the last quarter had a bunch of non-cat weather and large losses in it. But I guess, what I was trying to get a sense of was, how was non-cat weather, large loss activity in the current quarter relative to normal? Was that a benefit or not? And if it was, any numbers you could put to it?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I'm trying to -- so 6% -- if I look at the quarter-to-quarter combined ratio in Business Insurance was improved 6% CapEx, ex-cat, ex-PYD, about 2.5% of that was the earned rate over the loss trend. The next largest piece would have been the non-cat weather which was clearly better, and then we'd had large losses, I think that's the right sequence. I don't have the exact numbers on each of those pieces, but...", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm sorry, I think I confused the issue. I understand on a year-over-year basis why the non-cat weather and the large property is a such a big contributor. I guess, I was -- if you look at 3Q of this year, individually, would you characterize non-cat weather and large loss activity as kind of a nonfactor in kind of the way the underlying margin played out? Or was there any benefit to speak of? Because you've mentioned in the press release, but I wasn't quite sure if that was just with respect to the year-over-year or there was something -- it was just a reversal of that a year ago or if it actually was also good this quarter.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, the bigger impact was the reversal of bad from a year ago with regard to non-cat weather activity. But as it relates to the current quarter, the current quarter also was very light in weather, whether it was cat or non-cat. So we did have a benefit in the current quarter from what we would otherwise consider to be normal. And as Jay Fishman said before, the consideration on normal has lots and lots of judgment in it. So we're not going to sit here and say, well, it was worth 1 point, 0.5 point or 1 point. But what we can tell you is that the weather was benign in the third quarter and our results benefited from that.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then one question just on the construction surety, volumes are in decline. I was curious if you could get a sense -- give us a sense of how much of that is coming from commercial end markets versus residential end markets? And is there anything you see kind of as you look out that potentially could start to dampen that trend?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, this is Brian. I'll flip it to Alan. But we don't do a lot of residential. So...", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "It's way more driven by municipal finance and municipal construction, so not very much of it would be coming from the residential side.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, but I would assume that...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we're not active in that market. Our data is largely driven by the municipal arena but it's not because, it's not the -- we don't know what's happening in the residential segment, we're just not a real participant.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "But way more of the surety market relates to municipal construction projects where there is a statutory requirement for the surety product. So you don't have the same requirement or the same level of surety premium coming out of residential construction generally.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, I guess, kind of as a pass-through though to the municipal piece, there's always part of that is extending services into new areas, correct? So I guess on -- I'm just -- that was kind of what I was thinking -- asking the question was kind of what I had in mind, completely recognize the comment.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "The infrastructure buildings, roads and other utilities to service, development broadly. But I certainly don't have at my fingertips have the breakout between that and say highway construction. I wouldn't have that breakout.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to -- the one disconnect that I'm sort of wrestling with is the top line, in other words, premiums written and earned premiums. The percentage gains year-over-year are just not even close to where rates are at, and retentions look good. So it seems to be coming down to new business. So my first question, I guess, is it new business falloff that's sort of driving the lack of flow through, the actual reported top line? And if it is, I'm sort of wondering why do you think people are choosing not to join Travelers as much as they were before?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So the short answer is, yes, it is primarily new business. As you pointed out, retentions are down slightly in most of our businesses, but very solid and we feel great about those. We're getting price increases.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, down slightly from historical norms.", "Brian W. MacLean", "From historical norms, right. And actually across Business Insurance, for example, the overall retention, on a historical basis, a very strong number. Premium is up because we've got price exposure and audit premiums kicking through there. But across much of our Business Insurance area and clearly in personal lines, as we've executed on our strategy of improving margins and raising prices, the new business marketplace has become more difficult. And...", "Jay S. Fishman", "I think I'd separate the discussion into Commercial and Personal, because I'm not sure they're nearly as similar to that. But first, just an observation business, low exposure is a part of this 2, low exposure growth. That's talking about the overall, general economy. In Business Insurance, there is a phenomena that's been interesting to us. We have historically tracked a relationship between renewal pricing and new pricing. And in this quarter but also in the second, the spread between for us -- I'm not speaking about a broad market comment here, I'm only speaking about us. The spread between renewal and new that we booked actually narrowed, meaning it was better than historical standards would be. So in the context of the new business that we're taking on, we feel pretty good about it. If there's an opportunity here, if there is, it's making sure that our folks who are working so hard and focused on renewal -- renewal retention and gaining rate, don't ignore the new business opportunity. I don't believe, Greg, and I can't prove it to you, but I don't believe that it's people not choosing, as your words, not choosing to be with Travelers. I think if anything here, it's making sure that our folks have the energy as they go through the renewal process to make sure that they don't miss the opportunities in new that at these pricing levels any way are increasingly attractive. And we are focused on that and suspect that -- if you talk to an underwriter, they will tell you that renewing an account flat in a flat environment is pretty quick and pretty easy. But if you're discussing a rate increase with a broker or an agent on an individual account, it just takes more time. A lot of accounts and a lot more time being absorbed in the renewal arena, and we believe -- can't prove it to you, that we believe that this is mostly an issue of emphasis and effort and attention more than it is some substantive dynamic around new business that's in any way problematic. Can't prove it, but that's what we believe sitting around the table. In the Personal Insurance arena, we think it's different. There, the combination of -- particularly in homeowners, but also in auto, the combination of rate and then in homeowners the change in the deductible strategies that Brian has spoken about has -- we're most certainly leading. Again, that's our observation. We are leading in the market, but responding to what we think are substantive issues, the change in the weather, the other dynamics around it. And for the moment, there are alternatives, there are other companies that are available to new customers that may, in fact, be looking like they are less expensive. You get into the whole deductible dynamic and how much you pay for it. So on the Personal Insurance front, we're watching that carefully. It's almost -- personal, it's almost like where we were in Commercial a year ago, which is we were moving ahead and we were hopeful that we would be able to be successful with the strategy, turned out of course, at least, so far that we have been. In Business Insurance, you've seen -- I'm sorry, in Personal Insurance, you've seen the rate gains come on particularly in the last 2 quarters as the filings have taken hold, and combined with the underwriting and deductible dynamics, we're watching it carefully and seeing if it will be successful in the new arena, but only time will really tell. I hope that's helpful, and it's really a fulsome answer as we can provide.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Yes, that is. And just a quick follow-up then. Turning just to the business side. It sounds like that's a prioritization or a point of emphasis within the organization, deciding in a new business versus retention. I mean, my understanding is a point of retention is -- has a far, far better payback within your P&L than new business. Do the people within your organization get paid sort of the same for retention versus new business? Or in other words, are they agnostic or are they actually pursuing what is -- where the highest payback is in the Travelers' P&L, which is go get rate on the current book?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we can tell you how they're compensated. I hope that they're reacting consistent with it, but of course, you never know. We don't pay for production, we don't pay for new, we don't pay for renewal, we pay for an overall evaluation of performance, not only at an individual office level but actually right down to an individual underwriter level. The data analytics package, I spoke about earlier, really makes it possible for us to have a very granular conversation with each of the frontline people about how they've done. What you can't do is tell people that you really want to improve profitability, and when they take the right steps, even if that means that they lose an account, that you somehow think that's a bad thing. You have to embrace it and understand that it's a good thing. So the numbers, in and of themselves, of production, if you pay based to that, you can get some, not only unintended consequences, but frankly, it will make it difficult to employ the strategies that you know are right to improve profitability. So our payment process is one of -- let's evaluate what each of them has done in the past 12 months as everybody else in this place is evaluated, and we make the payments accordingly. I do think that -- it is hard being a field person right now. They are juggling lots of accounts, negotiating renewals, driving for rate, having to do the analytics behind all that to make sure that the selections they make are thoughtful and smart. And then you tell them, and by the way, don't forget to make sure that you're following up on new business opportunities. I do believe -- yes, and I can't prove it, but I do believe that it is a matter of emphasis and time management far more than it is pricing out of the marketplace. I have no indication that, that's the case or that there's some substantive dynamic of customers choosing away from us. I don't believe that either.", "Operator", "This concludes our Q&A session. I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Nawi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good. Thank you very much for joining us. And as always, myself and Andrew Hersom are available for follow-up questions.

At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our fourth quarter 2012 results.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Given Storm Sandy, we are very pleased to report fourth quarter net and operating income of $304 million and $278 million, respectively. For the full year, we reported $2.4 billion of operating income and operating return on equity of 11% and a 9.8% return on equity. Our financial and operational results for both the full year and the quarter were strong and demonstrate the success of the strategies we have implemented over the last few years.", "In Business Insurance, excluding National Accounts, we continued to achieve meaningful positive rate gains of nearly 8% in the quarter, while retentions continued to remain stable and new business remained at only marginally lower levels.", "Our Management Liability businesses have also produced similar pricing successes over the past year, achieving nearly 8% rate gains in the quarter. The operating environment for our businesses remains the same. Interest rates remain at historically low levels and weather patterns continue to be uncertain. Catastrophe losses this year totaled $1.2 billion after tax, making it another year with a very high level of catastrophe losses by historical standards. As such, we remain committed to our strategy of pursuing rate gains across all of our businesses in order to improve returns. We are particularly pleased with the rate gains we've achieved over the past 2 years and the compounding effect we are now recording.", "In Personal Insurance, both our Home and Auto business were also significantly impacted by Storm Sandy. Notwithstanding that impact, we are especially pleased with our Agency Homeowners business, which produced a 96.4% combined ratio for the full year and a 78.7% underlying combined ratio for the year.", "In our Agency Auto business, while we believe we are very much on the right path, we are not yet satisfied with our results. Our 99.2% underlying combined ratio for the year is not at a level that produces sufficient returns. As we have discussed previously since the fourth quarter of 2011, we have been experiencing an increase in auto severity, resulting in levels that have continue to exceed our expectations. But with the rate increases we have already achieved, earned rate gains exceeded our updated view of loss trend in the third and fourth quarters. In this regard, we are now achieving widening margins and we intend to continue this strategy. Assuming that we continue to achieve rate gains at this level, and the loss trend does not materially increase from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line. Brian will discuss this in more detail later.", "Turning to capital management, we remain committed to our strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders. In that regard, we repurchased $400 million of stock in the quarter, bringing total capital return to shareholders in 2012 to over $2.1 billion, including $700 million of dividends. Since embarking on our long-term strategy of returning excess capital to shareholders in 2006, we have reduced our shares outstanding by $362 million or 52%.", "Just another quick word on Sandy. The storm had a significant human impact on Travelers, as well as our customers and employees. We're extremely grateful to all the individuals who made personal sacrifices to help us deliver on the promise we extend with each one of our policies. Storm Sandy produced the largest number of claim notices in our history and even in this event, we were able to handle virtually all non-NFIP claims with our own adjusters. Just to give you a few highlights, in total, nearly 5,000 employees contributed to our response, we followed up with 80% of all claimants within 48 hours after their initial claim report and virtually 100% were recontacted within 72 hours and we paid or resolved approximately 90% of our Personal Insurance, non-NFIP claim estimates within 30 days of the first loss notice. These are really solid results that I was able to witness firsthand. Our claims group really makes us proud.", "In closing, we remain very pleased with the ability to deliver rate improvements across all our segments and generate superior returns over time. We entered 2013 with a real sense of optimism based on the strength of our competitive position.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks, Jay. Let me begin by stating that, as always, we've maintained our strong cash position, ending the year with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion. Operating cash flows were over $450 million for the quarter, despite the high claim payments related to Storm Sandy, as well as a discretionary $150 million contribution that we made to our qualified pension plan to maintain its high funding level even in this extremely low interest rate environment. Note, too, that for the full year, we generated over $3.2 billion of operating cash flows and, as Jay said, we returned over $2.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy.", "Turning to reserve development. We once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, $222 million pretax for the quarter, up from $126 million in the prior-year quarter. Also, as has been the case throughout the year, each of our business segments experienced favorable development. Business Insurance accounted for a little over half of this quarter's total, driven by better-than-expected loss experience related to last year's catastrophes, lower-than-expected claim department expenses or ULAE, and a modest improvement in Workers' Comp reserves. Most of the rest of this quarter's favorable development came from the Bond & Financial Products businesses within FP&II, and surety and management liability. For the full year, net favorable prior year reserve development, on a consolidated basis, was $940 million pretax, up from $715 million in the prior year.", "I'd also like to share with you a preliminary view of what our 2012 Schedule P will look like when it's filed. All accident years, other than 2011, have developed favorably, including accident years 2002 and prior, notwithstanding the A&E charges we recorded earlier in the year. Unfavorable development related to the 2011 accident year was small, only approximately $155 million pretax that was mostly due to higher-than-expected severity in Commercial and Personal Auto.", "Similarly, looking at our preliminary Schedule P data on a product line rather than on an accident year basis, shows that all of our product lines, with the exception of Commercial and Personal Auto, experienced net favorable prior year reserve development in 2012. Commercial and Personal Auto developed unfavorably on a pretax basis by only approximately $110 million and $25 million respectively, again, driven by the 2011 accident year.", "Finally, I would note that all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the year. Net unrealized investment gains, which were up for the full year, decreased slightly during the quarter to almost $4.8 billion pretax or $3.1 billion after-tax, while book value per share was $67.31 or 8% higher than at the beginning of the year.", "So with that, let me turn things over to Brian.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. I'm going to give an overview of the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance. Although operating income was down quarter-over-quarter in Business Insurance due to the losses from Storm Sandy, the fundamentals of the business continued to strengthen. As Jay just mentioned, prior year reserve development was favorable and higher than last year, and the underlying combined ratio of 92.8% was a 4-point improvement from the fourth quarter of 2011. On a full year basis, the underlying combined ratio improved more than 3 points year-over-year, with about 2 points of that improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend.", "Looking at the production statistics, starting on Page 9, retention continued to be strong at 80%, while new business was up slightly versus both the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2011. Net written premiums increased 6% in the quarter, with the largest increase in Workers' Comp, driven by higher pricing on our guarantee cost business and growth in residual market pools.", "Drilling into the pricing results, renewal premium change was 10%, up about 1 point from the third quarter, driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of 2%. The 8% rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from the third quarter and up 2 points from the 6% that we saw in the fourth quarter of 2011. The rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto. I would note that within the quarter, rate change was highest in the month of December, with total Business Insurance rate change of 8.3% and Commercial Accounts rate change of 9.8%.", "Loss trend, excluding catastrophes, has remained at approximately 4% overall. Specifically, the loss trend concerns in Workers' Comp and Commercial Auto that we spoke about several quarters ago, appear to have mitigated and are trending toward long-term historical trends. So overall, excluding weather, a very stable picture.", "Now I'd like to take a moment to discuss our results in Select, our small commercial business. In this business, we are pleased with the performance of our platform and operational dynamics, and we've seen great success in the marketplace. On the pricing side, as seen on the data on Slide 10, we've also made significant progress. Renewal premium change this quarter was nearly 12%, up consistently over the past 2 years. Along with these pricing gains, retention was up 1 point in each of the last 3 quarters, coming in at 78% this quarter. New business was down somewhat from recent quarters due to an increase in new business pricing. These pricing and underwriting actions have had a meaningful impact on our product, profit margins in this business, and we are very pleased with the results to date.", "So summarizing the entire Business Insurance segment, we were able to sustain our level of rate gains this quarter on top of the 6% gains from the prior-year quarter. This compounding of pure price improvement, combined with the 4% underlying loss trend, has had a meaningful impact on returns. However, given the ongoing weather volatility and challenging investment return environment, we will continue to -- we continue to see the need to execute on our targeted pricing strategy.", "In the Financial, Professional & International segment, our operating income decreased by 14% due entirely to the impact of Sandy, largely in our Lloyd's business. The underlying combined ratio improved about 3 points, for both the quarter and full year, driven primarily by increased rate in portfolio management in our Management Liability business, as well as risk selection in International.", "In Bond & Financial products, net written premiums were flat quarter-over-quarter, with higher production in Management Liability, offset by continued decline in surety volume. In Management Liability, retention remained strong at 85% in the quarter, while pure rate gains increased to 8%, making this the sixth consecutive quarter of sequentially increasing rate. Renewal premium change was 6%, which included negative exposure of 2% in the quarter, driven by a reduction in multiyear policies.", "In International, net written premiums were up about 4% or $12 million on a constant currency basis. The increase was driven by results in the U.K. and somewhat lower levels of seeded premium, partially offset by lower volume in the Canadian surety market. The International underlying loss ratio continues to trend favorably on a quarter-over-quarter basis.", "I'd also like to note that in December, we exercised our option to increase our ownership interest in the Brazilian joint venture from, round numbers, 43% to 49%. The results in Brazil have been very good, and we are pleased with our progress there.", "In Personal Insurance, fourth quarter results were significantly impacted by Sandy with after-tax cat losses of $370 million for the segment. Excluding the impact of cats and favorable prior year development, the underlying combined ratio improved over 9 points for the quarter and nearly 5 points on a full year basis. However, to really understand the dynamics in the segment results, we need to look at Homeowners and Auto separately, because they are somewhat different stories.", "In Auto, As Jay mentioned in his opening comments, we are not yet satisfied with our performance but believe we're on the path to improving our results. We continue to be very pleased with pricing gains, with renewal premium change of 9%, up about 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of 2011. Retention remained solid at 81% but as anticipated, our new business volumes have been impacted by our pricing actions. These pricing actions are in response to the severity challenges across all coverages that we began speaking to you about in the fourth quarter of 2011.", "The physical damage severity pressures we saw in 2011 persisted through the first half of 2012 but have since returned to near-normal levels. The bodily injury severity trends, however, have continued at elevated levels throughout the year. In addition to expected general inflation, we believe this increase in bodily injury trend is a result of more severe accidents. There are a number of environmental factors that can contribute to this trend, for example, data recently released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration shows road deaths for the first 9 months of 2012 increased 7% year-over-year, the largest such increase since 1975.", "So over the last 2 quarters, severity for all coverages is running just over 5%. With mix adjusted frequency about flat, overall loss trend is in the 5% range. Given the renewal premium change we've been able to achieve over the last 4 quarters, earned rate is now more than offsetting the aggregate loss trend.", "This margin expansion is somewhat difficult to see in our reported results due to prior period adjustments. On the Agency Auto combined ratio exhibit on Page 16, you can see these adjustments and the resulting adjusted underlying combined -- GAAP combined ratio, which improved about 1 point for both the quarter and full year. So on a go-forward basis, as you heard Jay say, at our current level of rate gains, and assuming loss trend does not increase materially from current levels, this will result in improved underwriting profitability in the line.", "Turning to Home, pricing was also very strong. Renewal premium change coming in at 13% was up 1 point from the third quarter and up 5 points from the fourth quarter of last year. Retention continued to be strong at 84%, while new business volume was lower than recent quarters due to the execution of our pricing strategy, higher deductibles and other profitability initiatives. Given these initiatives, our core underwriting margins are seeing significant improvement. However, it is difficult to evaluate this line's performance, excluding catastrophes, especially given the last 2 years experience. Accordingly, with the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to seek improved underwriting and policy pricing terms and conditions.", "We feel good about the progress we've made in the Personal Insurance segment, but challenges remain. We will continue to locally execute rate increases, underwriting changes and modifications to terms and conditions to further improve the risk profile and profitability of this business.", "So in summary, looking across all the business segments, let me reiterate what you've heard from us for the last several quarters. We are encouraged that we've been able to successfully execute a strategy that has resulted in tangible improvements in our underlying underwriting margins. We believe that these pricing and underwriting actions are appropriate, given the current level of investment returns, weather volatility and general loss trend, and we are well positioned to continue to thoughtfully execute on our strategy in 2013.", "With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. We will now begin the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Andre, we're ready to begin.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I have a question on the Sandy loss. I'm just trying to get a sense of where you might be in the kind of the finality of your loss estimates. I'm particularly interested in kind of cost inflation on reconstruction, if there's a tail from business interruption? And if you can quantify closed versus open claims at this point.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So one is -- this is Brian. Obviously, with this magnitude of event, there are always claims and issues that are still outstanding, but broadly speaking, there's no significant issue that we're looking at from the business interruption or liability or whatever side that leaves us feeling that there's a big tail. I'd turn to Doreen on the specifics with the closed claims. If you've got some of that data, Doreen, and want to share it.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I do, Brian. This is Doreen Spadorcia. Jay quoted you some statistics as to where we were 30 days from thinking -- reported from first notice of loss. At this point, since we're further on than 30 days, probably on the property side, we're at about 95% of our losses in that position. In terms of tail issues, on Auto, we still have salvage losses to collect and we're in the middle of doing that, but those we've factored in. And on Boat & Yacht that those losses tend to take a little bit longer as well, but again, all of them have been factored into our analysis. So we're pretty well through most of those claims that were reported.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And Doreen, my comments were to Personal Insurance; your comments were to all lines.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Yes. Absolutely. Thank you, Jay.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "So just to clarify, you're saying you're 95% closed on those property claims?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Yes.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Wow. And then just on, would -- just one on demand surge, a lot of reconstruction going on in New Jersey. Is that becoming an issue, like it has with past events, or is that under control?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I would say, at this point, our estimates of what we saw when we initially evaluated the property, our holdings, we always have situations, Randy, when someone has additional damage and we look at those. And that's kind of a normal course. But at this point, nothing out of the ordinary.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, just 2 questions. The first is in the Personal Auto side, the PIF count shrank, a bit more than it had been. It looks like renewal is relatively stable, new business is down. I'm wondering if you could just give us some color around that PIF growth because that was down a bit more than it had been, and more than we had expected.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Jay, this is Jay Fishman. I think you're analyzing it correctly. The PIF is being impacted by our pricing increases. We recognize that we're -- in some areas that there are less expensive alternatives that are available to agents and in some cases, they're embracing it. Our pricing strategy is based on what our loss trends look like and the severity dynamic is real, and it is substantive and doesn't appear -- we may be wrong about this, but it doesn't appear to be a Travelers-only phenomena. This seems to be broad-based. So we're taking the actions that we know we have to, to produce appropriate returns over time. And if the policies in force shrink somewhat, that's fine, and we will just continue to price it as we know have to, to achieve the returns that we speak about.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Makes sense. Second question, in the past, you have given some discussion or guidance around capital management kind of forward-looking. As you look at 2013, can you talk about your buyback expectations relative to your earnings?", "Jay S. Benet", "Jay, this is Jay Benet. I'd go back to the wording that we had in the Ks and the Qs. Nothing's really changed. We have earnings that we're going to generating. From those earnings, we need to have capital to support whatever business growth we have. There may be some needs like pension contributions into our qualified plan, whatever. We lay those out. But ultimately, the idea behind our capital management strategy is to return all the excess capital that we have to the shareholders, and that'll go back to shareholders in the form of dividends, as well as common stock repurchases. And it's really going to be driven by the level of earnings, ultimately.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Let me -- it's Jay Fishman. Let me just come back with one sentence on the PIF count. You did see it, but I just want to make sure it's clear. Retention remains stable in Auto. We are not losing existing accounts. What we have done is experience a lower level of new business than historical trends, but retention importantly, is remaining stable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I have 2 questions here for you. The first one, I was hoping, Jay and Brian, maybe you could comment about where we are with respect to rate adequacy in the Business Insurance area. If I look at it on an at or near basis, it looks like you're probably kind of low to mid-teens ROEs on that business right now, is that correct?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we -- Brian, it's Jay Fishman. We haven't disclosed what our product line returns are. I think you can look at the overall business and really make 2 adjustments that are available to you, and you'll come up with what, I think, a reasonable way to think about return on equity is. One is, you can easily eliminate the favorable development. And two, I think you can adjust the catastrophe costs back to what a more normal run rate would look like. Those 2 are not identical in the absolute level, but they're actually pretty close. They just about cancel each other out. And if you do that, you'll get to a business ROE overall that's round numbers. And I'm not being precise here because I don't have it in my hand, but round numbers, it's about 10%. Now in terms of -- 10%, to 11%, let's say, and people are looking at me. And the real question that you're posing that's so difficult to answer is rate adequacy in the environment where the risk-free rate is 1.5%. We've talked about -- in previous quarters, we've talked about maintaining our aspirational goal of mid-teens return on equity over time. But we've said that under the current environment, it's simply not achievable, and it remains not achievable. And I think most of us who are responsible for managing complex financial businesses are wrestling with if your cost of equity at the moment is sitting in the 7% to 8% range, what is rate adequacy, what is return adequacy in this environment? This is unprecedented, and I spend -- we spend a fair amount of our time thinking about what level of returns is really appropriate. Because I think one of the risks in managing any business, and I think we saw it in 2008, is when management decides that it's going to try and get blood from a stone, it just doesn't happen. But if you look at it overall, we're sort of in that 10% to 11% range at the moment, and a bunch of factors coming at us. But I know you have a longer question, but that's sort of where we sit at the moment.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then, the second one is a little more detail on the Commercial Auto loss trend situation there. Is it physical damage, is it liability, what's going on with that line?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Within Commercial Auto, it's not dissimilar to the conversation we just had on Personal Auto. So it's fundamentally severity-driven. And at this point, the bigger severity issue is on the bodily injury side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "The accident year combined in Business Insurance improved by -- improved materially 400 basis points. Was that all quarter-to-quarter, or was there some catch-up from other quarters this year?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, this is Jay Benet. There really aren't any catch-up adjustments relating to earlier quarters in the year. So that's -- with minor variation on that, that's a pure number.", "Adam Klauber - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "Okay. That's -- it was a very good number. Could you ballpark that -- and not looking for an exact number, but I mean how much of that 400 basis point improvement is from nonrenewing poor business versus getting rate versus loss trend and existing business?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So this is Brian. Hard to precisely segment that, but I did say in my comments, we're getting about 2 points from pure rate over the loss trend now. And then, there's always other stuff within a quarter that's moving within the loss ratio, so the non-cat weather, other large losses, fire losses, et cetera will be volatile. And some of that was moving to the good. So the biggest driver is the rate in excess of loss trend, which is 3 points? Okay, 3 points in the quarter -- in the quarter, yes, right. So that's the biggest piece of it. Obviously, there's something with the re-underwriting issues in a lasered way that you're talking about, but that is not the broad-based issue moving through the results.", "Jay S. Benet", "And we don't track, because I wouldn't know how, candidly, to track the improvement in profitability that resulted from nonrenewing accounts. That's -- specifically to your question, that's just not something that I -- that we measure or keep track of.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "If I can go back to Agency Auto really quickly, I think, when we saw the decelerating new business despite, maybe, incremental improvements in pricing, does not mean that the environment is becoming more competitive?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, I don't think it's an incremental improvement in pricing. I'd use a different word, and the kind of pricing change that's occurred here is substantial. And at the Agency Auto level, with increasing use of comparative raters at the agency level, pricing is certainly more important, we suspect, than it was, let's say, 5 or 6 years ago. A greater ability, technological change at the agency level for agents to generate multiple quotes relatively quickly and efficiently so that it's -- the comparison process is just easier. So I think that, that's really what's driving it. This is a meaningful change in pricing, driven by a meaningful change in loss trend and weather and interest rates and all that goes with it, and the price is the price, and it'll show up on comparative raters. I don't believe, I may be wrong about this, but I don't believe that the Agency Auto business has become a business where the only thing that matters is price. We do believe that agents have views about companies and their ability to serve individual customers in certain ways, and that's what we've traded on all these years and continue to now. So whatever the new business dynamics are, they are. We have a really strong philosophy here, which is that volume is not a goal, it's a result. If we do all the things that are right, and we're moving in the right direction, the revenues, the premiums will be what they'll be, and then we manage the business accordingly. And that's really what you're seeing in Personal Auto.", "Meyer Shields - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's very thorough. The tax rate on the non-net investment income component was a lot lower than, I think, it's been in prior quarters. I was hoping someone can explain that.", "Jay S. Benet", "I'm not sure that's the case. So if you take a look at the tax accruals, if you were to just separate investment income from the rest of earnings, effectively, what you do is, you take round numbers, 35% of the non-investment income, that's the tax provision or tax benefit, if there's an underwriting loss. And then, as it relates to the investment income, we give you the effective tax rates. So I think if you do the arithmetic, you really come very close to what the tax provisions are.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So I had one question, just kind of looking over the last couple years, looks like you've got 8 points of rate in Business Insurance over the last 12 months or so and then, another almost 7 points the year before that. So 15 points in the aggregate of a couple years, looks like combined ratio is a bit better. Just trying to understand, does that mean that more rate -- we should expect more rate to earn through over the next 12 months? How much of that dynamic is due to mix changes, the Commercial Auto stuff that Jay mentioned upfront, or is there something else? And I just have one follow-up.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I think we'll answer this in a couple of pieces. First, obviously, written rate becomes earned rate, so yes, what we've written in these last several quarters will convert to earned over the next several quarters, and that's just arithmetic. The -- our intent here is to continue. This was always a granular, active pricing strategy. We've commented before we're not big believers here in sort of mythical cycles that carry the industry up and then carry it down. We think that it is one agent, one underwriter and one account at a time. So this strategy here has been extremely active and very granular and applied to individual accounts, putting rate at accounts that need it, taking all of the factors into account: taking interest rates, taking the perspective of changing weather and taking some of the loss trend that affect some of the lines into account. So that's going to be the -- that's going to be our prospective policy, and we're going to continue to do that. I don't know if you have any...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, specifically on the mix issue, it's not fundamentally a mix issue. We've talked for a number of quarters now that, although Commercial Auto and comp are at the higher end of the rate change grid for us, it's really pretty broad based, and we're getting between 6 and 10 points in all lines. And we haven't really shifted our line mix significantly at all. So that's not driving it.", "Jay S. Fishman", "We shared with you in the last quarter, in the previous quarters, the breakdown of the accounts, the segments. The one we show you are the ones that track profitability, a long-term profitability, combined ratio by account -- loss ratio by account, actually. And we said in the last quarter and before that, that our greatest opportunity was in those segments of the accounts that were at the low end of the profitability spectrum. We still believe that to be true, that the greatest opportunity for us in terms of improving profitability is at that less-profitable end of the segment, which again speaks to the granular nature of the strategy that we're applying.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And I just wanted to revisit maybe direct. I mean, we've talked about it maybe a little while back. How are you thinking about that? It looks like the first time that PIF started to fall a bit, maybe ratio. I don't know if that's advertising came down a bit in the quarter on a sequential basis. How are you thinking about that? And what is your outlook for when that business needs to rightsize in order for that to be an area of continued investment?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, it's a pleasure. In the direct business, we've been involved for the last, I don't know, several quarters, 2, maybe 3, something like that, in a very granular test of elasticity pricing strategy applied in, I -- 2 or 3 states, I -- where we really didn't have a robust agency business. And we were able to change the pricing in those states, both agency and direct, to begin to test the elasticity of demand in the direct arena. That's one of the reasons why the advertising spend is down, because it's being applied in a very narrow way in these last several months, just trying to drive activity in these 2 states, I'm told. And the results have been extremely informative and encouraging in that we're getting increasingly close or closer to having a pricing schedule, a pricing strategy, that we think can work in the direct arena and can be applied both at reasonable marketing success, we believe, as well as an underwriting success. But we remain some distance away yet from what I would call launching in a broad way, but we continue to make real progress and are encouraged by the results. There's nothing that causes us to think that we should discontinue the spend on it. Quite the contrary, we feel really encouraged about what we're learning and discovering. And as I've always said, the thing that we could do wrong here is have a marketing success and a financial failure. And that would not be acceptable here, so we're going to continue to take our time and make sure that when we aggressively approach the business, that we do so with all the requisite knowledge and learning and skills and with a high degree of confidence in the success of the program.", "Operator", "And this line is -- Mr. Zaremski, your line is open.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. I was hoping to better understand the underlying margin improvement drivers within Home. So other than pricing, is there quantifiable elements coming from geographic culling and/or terms of condition changes that you guys have been talking about for a while?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, first of all, the biggest driver is pricing. There's no question about that. And...", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, and weather. Yes, and there's been a number of things. In the fourth quarter of last year, we had an unusually high concentration of fire-related losses. This year, we had a low level of fire-related losses, relative to some norms. In addition to that, there was a little more weather in the fourth quarter of last year than this year. So Brian spoke before about just things that happened on a quarter-to-quarter basis that caused some variations but those along with, the major item being loss cost trend x weather, which is a hard thing to really talk about as it relates to Homeowners being lower than earned rate. And if you look at those 3 components, the lower fire losses, the lower weather-related losses, as well as earned rate over loss trend, then that's really what's making up the difference.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And to answer your question directly: We really don't have a metric to convey to you the impact of, let's say, increasing deductibles on the profitability of the business. We would have to go back and rerun the losses using the deductibles that existed previously, and that's just not possible for us to do.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then lastly, as a follow-up to the questions about the capital management for 2013. So I see you've contributed, I think, over a couple hundred million dollars to the pension this year and you have $500 million of debt coming due in a couple months. In regards to the pension, if interest rates stay low, should we expect a similar contribution? And are you guys considering refi-ing with that?", "Jay S. Benet", "Let's talk about the pension first. If you strip away all that takes place in valuing the -- a PBO versus the assets, there's a normal level of earned credit, if you will, that runs through the numbers. And it's about $100 million, round numbers, a year. So if everything worked in accordance with the assumptions, in a steady state, the pension contribution would be about that. The reason the pension contribution is higher this year is things don't work as a steady state. We had a good return on the assets. On the other hand, when you look at the valuation of the pension benefit obligation as of 12/31, which is a spot rate interest concept that you use, you had very, very low interest rates at that point in time. So we looked at that and said, \"Gee, on balance, it feels like $200 million is the right number to put in this year.\" It got us to a funding level that was high, approximately 90%, which is where we started the year. If rates spike up, we're not going to be terribly overfunded. We'll just adjust future funding accordingly. And that would be a nice position to be in, frankly, if rates went up a bit. But $100 million is what we think about as more of a normal level on a year-by-year basis. As it relates to the debt, as we generally do, we try to maintain full flexibility in dealing with our capital position. So we ended the year, as I said earlier, with over $2 billion of holding company liquidity, which allows us to be in a position of paying the debt when the debt's due to avoid any kind of liquidity concerns. And then we'll just continue to evaluate what the proper structure of our balance sheet is going forward based on interest rates and based on how we feel. But certainly, in terms of capacity, we have the capacity to keep the debt ratio just where it is today if we so choose.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "My first question is on your catastrophe reinsurance coverage, which I know expires on June 30. And maybe this is a bit too early: The -- when you new look towards 2013, 2014, do you think your cat cover will look similar? Or has the thinking changed post Sandy?", "Jay S. Fishman", "The thinking actually changed a little bit a couple of years ago when we reintroduced -- I'm sorry, when we introduced an aggregate -- cumulative aggregate element to our reinsurance program. And we started that, I think, last year at the July coverage and actually expanded it some effective January 1. We actually increased this cumulative aggregate program, which has the effect of giving us a benefit against the retention in the cat program should the individual events exceed retentions and then cumulatively apply against the overall cat program. With respect to the cat program itself, I wouldn't anticipate any significant changes to that. Our property coverage exposure really has not changed. We were comfortable with where we were last year. It may depend upon pricing move a little bit up or a little down, but the important change, the more important change, is the introduction of this aggregate program to our overall cat merits.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, the one thing I would add is, when we did Long Point Re II, we had pegged it to RMS. And when RMS 11 came out, it raised the trigger points associated with that. And in this [ph] past year, we issued a $250 million cat bond with Long Point Re III. And as Long Point Re II turns itself over, we will probably bring those limits -- bring those trigger points down into something that looks more like Long Point Re III.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Got it. That's very helpful. The only other question I have is on Business Insurance pricing and maybe using Slide 9 as a backdrop, and perhaps this question is for Jay. The -- when you talk to your largest agent or business, post Sandy, is there a greater acceptance on pricing? Or do you think there was an uptick in December, and just based on the economic conditions, it's already beginning to sort of normalize as you look towards Q1?", "Jay S. Fishman", "I think it's -- well, I think the environment, particularly for the January 1 renewals -- and this is anecdotal, what I'm giving you, because I don't -- we don't have the data yet, but the anecdotal observations for January in renewals and the related rate was very similar in the aggregate to what December looked and felt like. So I don't -- I wouldn't anticipate any immediate change of consequence in January. I -- Sandy is a tough one to really talk about pricing. I think that it continues to reinforce the notion that weather patterns may be changing, and we've been saying that now for a couple of years and embracing that in our pricing strategy. And I suspect -- again, no evidence on this, but I suspect that the storm will simply make that argument easier to make, both at the agent level as well as the insured level. I would tell you this, notwithstanding how -- sort of the perceptions of Sandy, it was in the playbook. The storm itself, the track, the path, it wasn't something that -- as we do our analysis and modeling, that we didn't contemplate. It was certainly there. I think the surprise, to the extent there was one, in Sandy was, to some extent, the timing of it. Meaning, it was full moon, it was 2 tides. There were a lot of ancillary factors that made it more significant than it might otherwise have been. But importantly, the flooding was more severe. And this is really -- it's predominantly a -- I'd say it's largely a Homeowners kind of question with respect to the NFIP program, but it does have its impact on commercial insurance as well. There were buildings that we insured in Lower Manhattan that we would not had contemplated would have been part of a flooding event. The flood coverage that we extended was really episodic for them, meaning we contemplated broken pipes or backup or things of that nature, not a flood coming out of the East River or the Hudson River. And importantly, the dynamic there is the sea level. And this is just from things I read, but sea level is, depending upon who you ask, anywhere from 6 to 12 inches higher in Manhattan than it was about a century ago, driven largely by the melting of the polar ice caps and what that's doing to the water level. So I think what Sandy will do is cause people to think somewhat differently about concentrated flood risk than they had before. It'll take some time, it's a complicated issue. But all of us, I suspect, we certainly are, looking at flood concentrations in the commercial segment and analyzing it with a little different perspective than we did before. Those were -- that was, I think, the big takeaway from Sandy that was different from what we might otherwise have contemplated.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "This is a follow-up to Brian Meredith's question before on sort of rate increases in Business Insurance and the ROE, because the ROE right now seems to certainly be pretty healthy [ph], in fact close to about 11% x the OCI. So just first, curious on the Business Insurance front, how do you see rate increases this year versus last year? Do you see them tapering off a little bit? Or are you pushing for the same magnitude of rate increases?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, it's -- as I've said before, it's a very granular approach. We have accounts that are at pricing levels that we're satisfied with, that we feel good about, and we have accounts where that's not the case. And that may be driven by the loss experience. It may be driven by the mix and long tail versus short tail, and the impact of interest rates. And it may be impacted also by geographic concentrations relative to catastrophe management. We look at this very granularly. In some businesses, as we've told you before, we break accounts down into quintiles. In some business, we actually break them so far as deciles. And our pricing strategy is driven by the account and its sports class and its performance and where it fits. So we'll let the -- we will continue to do what we do by looking at individual accounts. We have no artificial limits. We look at an account and we try and understand its profitability and how it contributes. And if it's not contributing in what we think is a substantive way, we have a discussion with the agent. So that strategy is no different than it was a year ago. And we'll continue to do it, and the number will be what the number is. And I do -- I would acknowledge to you that a very important question in all this, and I don't have an answer for you but it's one that I think about a great deal is, again using a 1.5% risk-free rate, what level of overall returns are achievable and sustainable without jeopardizing the risk profile of the organization. That is the question. And we're not there yet, but we're -- so we're going to continue to push.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "So fair enough. And you mentioned that the rate increase is, I think, 8.3% in December, so tipped towards the higher end. Could you give us some color on what the rate increases were in January of this year?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. So when the -- so this is Brian. In the middle-market businesses where we have a little bit better transparency into that, the January ones, the early January that we've seen the middle market look a lot like December, so that's encouraging. Small commercial, it's harder to state, and so we'll get a better look at that at the end of the quarter. But the little peek that we've got is encouraging, but that's -- it's a little window.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that helpful. And just one follow-up. From the Commercial Auto, there were some adverse physical [ph] development. If you could please provide some color on sort of the subcomponents of that -- those small fleet versus big fleet, along with trucking, and whether that was more of a severity issue or a frequency issue.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So it's a -- just like we said in personal auto, it's a bodily injury severity issue. And it's really across the book of business. So it -- we don't think -- the Commercial Auto book of business, right. We don't think of it as a really lasered underwriting as in a problem in one business, but we're seeing it kind of systemically in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to -- in your prepared remarks, you mentioned Schedule P and sort of gave us a sneak peek. I just wanted to confirm the -- so the Workers' Comp line has inflected. So I seem to recall that the 2010 policy year developed adversely when we look at the '11 data. And it sounds like, from your remarks, that '11 policy year is going to have developed favorably when we look at the '12 Schedule P. Is that true for -- and this is for Workers' Comp, specifically?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, well, for Workers' Comp overall last year, we did see, as you talked about for the last -- yes, I should get into the years because we're in 2013. Well, if you look -- if you go back a year and you're in the end of -- the beginning of 2012 looking backwards, the 2010 accident year did develop unfavorably at that time for Workers' Comp. If we now roll the clock forward, there hasn't been any further developments associated with the 2010 accident year in 2012. And then if we look at the 2011 accident year for Workers' Comp, a year later in 2012, we've seen some slightly favorable development for that. And overall, in 2012, as I said, our Workers' Comp has developed favorably. So that's the Workers' Comp story. And I think it speaks to what we were communicating a year ago. Given the nature of our processes, the granularity of the data that we have and the quarterly diligence we have, we like to believe that when we -- we see trends early, we react to those trends and we book them and move on.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, good. And I mean, that's a great inflection. Do you -- this may not be fair, but do you think the industry is going to see the same or, as, I guess, your remarks just suggested, are you way ahead of it?", "Jay S. Benet", "I hope that -- well, we certainly can't speak for the industry. I mean, everybody has got their data, their views, their reserving practices. And I think you just have to look at what companies will be doing. But in terms of our data and our analysis and being able to stay on top of things, we think the numbers speak for themselves.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And last on Comp is just I haven't heard a good explanation: Why did frequency spike up? I think it was a frequency issue, at least at the industry level. With the benefit, in some ways, of hindsight, what is the reasoning behind this, the higher loss trend that came through that was somewhat unexpected that, obviously, now you guys have gotten in front of?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so we've talked about it a good bit, I don't know, a year-plus ago. But as you hit the economic downturn, clearly, losses mitigated -- frequency mitigated as it usually does. People are concerned with maybe losing their jobs so they don't go out on a Comp claim. As employers lay off workers, they lay off the least experienced first, et cetera, et cetera. And then you would typically see a rebound from that as there's a -- there's kind of a pent-up delay in loss reporting. And so what we saw clearly in our results, we can't speak to the rest of the industry, was that, that spiked up a little harder than we thought it was going to. And so we had a backlog, and so delayed reporting, from the previous years, and that kind of came through. So our frequency picked up. Again...", "Jay S. Fishman", "It was 2010. It was in 2010 that we saw a spike in what we have come to call late-reported claims, accidents occurring prior but reported in 2010.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right, right. So these are people who maybe an incident in '09 and tried to work through it and by the time 2010 comes along -- and again, we expected some of that. It was just greater magnitude than what we had originally expected. And we've seen it mitigate.", "Jay S. Benet", "And this is Jay Benet again. I just want to -- I'm being reminded by one of my colleagues, the word \"preliminary\" is a very critical element of my discussion of schedule fee. It is early. We still are putting it together, but directionally, we feel that this is -- what I said before, is where we're going to end up.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I had just a couple of follow-ups. The first is on investment income. Can you talk about the seasonality of that? It seems to be stronger in 4Q than in 1Q, and I'm just thinking if that trend will repeat in 2013, 4Q '12 versus 1Q '13.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, in the fourth quarter of '12, a lot of private equity funds were trying to sell companies because of an uncertain tax filing in 2013. That may be a one-year occurrence...", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was referring just to the fixed income aspect.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I'm not sure there really is seasonality there. I mean, the -- there's $1 million difference where someone seized on. There are 3 elements to that. There's volume of the portfolio, there's rate and then there's calendar days in the quarter. And the net of those accounts for -- generally accounts for any small difference quarter-to-quarter. But net investment income from fixed income comes in pretty much like the tide.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Well, I was looking at fourth quarter '11 stronger than first quarter of '12. And I'm just thinking, well, should we not use that $500 million of after-tax fixed income from 4Q '12 as the run rate for the beginning of '13?", "Jay S. Benet", "Well, what's taking place in fixed income is there's a constant maturity of certain securities in the portfolio, and they're being reinvested at today's rates. And there's been several analyses we've put out into the marketplace, which I'd refer you to, that talk about some estimates of the maturities in the portfolio, how much the yield is on that block that's maturing. And then you can pick your number whether they're going to be reinvested at 200 basis points; 225; 175, less. What you're generally seeing is a deterioration in the overall yield in the portfolio. It's not dramatic, but it's real. And the numbers that you see in the webcast, in the fixed income slide, are reflective of that in terms of, as you know, quarter-to-quarter comparisons.", "Jay S. Fishman", "But there's no seasonality in the fixed income result at all.", "Brian W. MacLean", "We track book yields quarter to quarter and year to year. And over the 12 months of 2012, book yield of the portfolio declined by 33 basis points. And that's not unusual. But the decline is inexorable until we reach the point at which reinvestment rates -- in which all the securities with high book yields have run off and they're replaced, and that's 2 or 3 years off.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then my separate question is on Personal Auto. To get you to your targeted returns, what type of combined ratio do you feel you need to be able to generate?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I would say, about a 97, between 96, 97 combined.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Matthew Heimermann with JPMorgan.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Two questions. First was just -- is -- you've noted non-cat weather this quarter, and that's been a theme all year. I guess I was just trying to get a handle, is there a number you could give us to kind of quantify how much of a tailwind that was this year? And I recognize that we're comparing 2012 to what was a slightly worse-than-normal year in 2011.", "Jay S. Benet", "I don't know that we can give you a number. I think we try to do it the other way around. Brian's talked about what the impact of earned rate versus loss trend is. And these other things, whether it's non-cat weather or, as I said earlier, we had fire losses in one quarter higher than another quarter, or there's large loss activity. But we try to do it the other way and talk about what's underlying it in terms of rate versus \"loss trend.\"", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Is there a way to give us a sense of whether or not it's -- I would assume -- tell me if this is right, I would assume it's just more a personal lines benefit that it is a commercial lines benefit. Is that perception correct?", "Jay S. Benet", "No, it's meaningful in both, depending upon the quarter.", "Jay S. Fishman", "It's not unusual. And I -- we're not, not answering because we don't answer. We're not answering because you're asking a question that's exceptionally difficult for us to actually quantify. It's how much of a -- you're sort of asking, within our normal loss estimates, how much are we relying on of weather, and that's a tough question for us to answer. I -- we do note, though, that it is not unusual in a high-cat year to have lower, what we call, non-cat weather. And I -- and we suspect, can't prove, but we suspect what happens is that some of the claims that would ordinarily show up as non-cat weather get included into the catastrophe estimates, and those customers who had some loss previously now get rolled into here. I -- and it's an anecdotal observation, but it does appear to have some actual fact in the numbers.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "No, that's fair. I guess the fact that you know it's happening, though, makes it a little surprising to me that we can't get a ballpark number but -- because -- you know what I mean, because that implies there's some recognition of the trend somewhere but...", "Brian W. MacLean", "But for example, in BI, as I said before, about a 4-point improvement in the combined, roughly 3 points of that is the core price in loss trend. So it's about 1 point of other stuff, a decent chunk of which would be what we're talking about, so -- but it's not...", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes. I was -- yes, can you give -- but do you have that handy for the full year? I mean...", "Gabriella Nawi", "It's not out. We'll try and take some of this off-line because I know we've talked about particularly what affected 2011 for the full year, and you can see some of that in the run rate. So I'll get you off-line.", "Matthew G. Heimermann - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Yes, no, that's fair. I just don't want to over- or underestimate the core. I guess the other thing was, should we think about the normalizing loss trend we're seeing in -- or what you characterize, I think, as a normalization of the trends in Work Comp as knocking on the -- to kind of the implied rate need in 2012? I know that's been an area where you've been getting some of the bigger headline gains, so I just wonder -- as we're all really focused on what the headline rate number is, but I'm just wondering if that's kind of a very -- a transparent example of where a headline rate might come in, but when you think about what you're getting relative to loss trend, might not affect that spread whatsoever.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, when -- we're looking at each other. First, I'd make -- we -- in Workers' Comp, most certainly, the rate gains are exceeding loss trend in Workers' Comp, resulting in improved profitability and improved returns. So while the loss -- or the projected losses in Comp are substantive because we -- it's long tail and we're dealing with medical and wage inflation, so there's a real number that we use. We -- it's not a number that we disclose. I think it is proprietary and a pricing strategy element. But we do assume a real loss level in Workers' Comp that contemplates changes in those -- in both wage and medical. But at this point, the rate gains are exceeding it. Now I would remind you that Workers' Comp as a return -- thinking about Workers' Comp in a return manner, that it's real long tail, and interest rates really matter there. So it's one of those lines where the interest rate, long-term interest rate, impact is substantive relative to the returns. So that may be as much of the driver as the loss trend dynamic in that line.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Yes. And Matt, just to be precise, the only thing we talked about moderating was the frequency dynamic that we've seen in 2011. We didn't comment on the other.", "Jay S. Fishman", "We continue to assume a real number, both in severity, both related to wage and indemnity. It is just a frequency, to Gabby's point, that is -- that we've seen return back to the normal trend line.", "Operator", "This does conclude the Q&A session for the call. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Nawi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you very much. Thank you for joining us today. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, you can call myself or Andrew Hersom in the investor relations department.

Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, April 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our first quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also in the room, available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before turning to our results this morning, I want to take a moment and comment on the events of the last week. No doubt, someone will ask about the cost of the events in Boston or in West Texas. While right now we don't expect either event will be meaningfully costly to us, my real answer is that the human cost is stunning, and we are reminded of the fragile nature of the world in which we live. Our sympathies go out to everyone affected in these horrific events, and we will do all we can to help them in the recoveries. As we are reminded of September 11, we wish only the best for the folks in Texas and embrace fully the sentiment of Boston strong.", "Now turning to our results. We are very pleased to report a strong start to 2013, with operating income of $2.31 per diluted share, which is the highest quarterly operating income per share since Travelers' initial public offering in 2002. Both net and operating income increased 11% from last year's first quarter results to $896 million and $887 million, respectively, producing a return on equity of 14.1% and an operating return on equity of 15.8%.", "Our margins improved significantly, with a GAAP combined ratio of 88.5%. Importantly, underlying underwriting margins increased across all our business segments, in large measure the result of the pricing and underwriting actions we have taken over the last few years. Our 90.8% underlying GAAP combined ratio was an improvement of almost 4 points from the prior year, as earned rate increases outpaced expected loss trends in each segment.", "While we are certainly pleased with these results, we will continue our strategy of taking the steps necessary to continue improving accident year profitability and returns. Our focus is evident in the production statistics for each segment this quarter. Renewal rates were at or above levels achieved in recent quarters and exceeded expected loss-cost trends in each segment.", "In addition, retention rates remain at very high levels. We also saw modest new business growth in Business Insurance. And while new business in Personal Insurance remains meaningfully down from historical levels, it was consistent with fourth quarter 2012 levels. Brian will take you through the details by segment.", "Next, I'd like to comment briefly about our total return to shareholders as measured by the net stock price change plus cumulative amount of dividends over the same time period assuming dividend reinvestment. We've shown this information in the past and believe it is an important measure of our long-term success.", "The universe you see on Slides 4 and 5 contain the 20 largest S&P financial companies by market capitalization, as well as companies in our P&C insurance peer group. As Slide 4 demonstrates, our total return to shareholders for each of these periods is impressive. Slide 5 shows the return on a Treynor risk-adjusted basis. And amongst these companies, we are first on a 1- and 5-year basis, and sixth on a 3-year basis. These results are very gratifying.", "It's worth noting that over the last 5 years, the compound annual growth rate in our book value per share has been 9.4%; in earnings per share, it's been 8.6%; and in dividends per share, it's been 9.7%. If we include the dividend increase announced today, it's 11.5%.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I want to take a moment and extend the best wishes of 30,000 Travelers' employees to our friend and colleague, Chuck Clarke. Chuck is retiring after 55 years, indeed a lifetime of service with Travelers. It is not possible to overstate the impact that Chuck has had on so many of us at Travelers, and we will all benefit from his powerful legacy for many years to come. He is the best in our business, and we all wish him the best in this next chapter in his life. I will miss him more than I can express.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks, Jay. As Jay said, we're very pleased with our first quarter results as well as our liquidity and capital positions. Operating cash flows of approximately $530 million. It was strong despite higher-than-normal claim payment related to Storm Sandy. We repaid $500 million of debt that matured in March and maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $1.5 billion. We continue to generate more capital than what is needed to support our businesses, so we returned $476 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $176 million and common share repurchases of $300 million, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy.", "And we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.46 per share to $0.50 per share, an increase of almost 9%. We also recorded on a consolidated basis, pretax net favorable prior year reserve development of $231 million for the quarter, which was lower than the $304 million we recorded in the prior year quarter. And each of our segments, once again, saw its reserves develop favorably.", "I should point out that this quarter's reserve development included an unusual item, a $42 million pretax charge, precipitated by legislation in New York related to the New York fund for reopened cases for Workers' Compensation.", "Business Insurance accounted for a little less than half of this quarter's total reserve development. Favorable development in BI was driven by better-than-expected loss experienced in general liability for accident years 2003 and prior, as well as accident years 2004 through 2010, resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected; and by property loss development for accident years 2010 through 2012.", "I should also note that BI reserve development was reduced by the $42 million pretax charge precipitated by the New York legislation concerning Workers' Comp that I mentioned previously. And excluding the impact of this legislation, our Workers' Comp reserves were essentially unchanged for all accident years.", "The rest of this quarter's favorable reserve development primarily resulted from better-than-expected loss development in Bond & Financial Products contract surety business for accident years 2006, '07, '08 and '10, better-than-expected loss development of several international businesses within FPII and better-than-expected cat and non-cat loss development in Personal Insurance Homeowners business for accident year 2011.", "On a combined statutory basis for all of our U.S. subs, accident years 2003 and prior as well as accident years 2004 through 2011, all developed favorably in the quarter, while accident year 2012 developed very slightly unfavorably.", "And finally, to update you on Storm Sandy, our current estimate of total ultimate losses is now $1.011 billion net of reinsurance and pretax, down $13 million from our fourth quarter 2012 estimate.", "Finally, all of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels at the end of the quarter. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $4.4 billion pretax or $2.9 billion after-tax, a slight decrease from the beginning of the year, due to the rise in interest rates that took place during the quarter. And book value per share was $68 or $0.07 -- 7% higher than at the end of the prior year quarter and 1% higher than at the beginning of the year.", "So with that, let's have Brian talk about the operations.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. I'll go through the segment results in some details, but the overall headline from an underwriting perspective is the margin expansion that we saw in all our business segments.", "Beginning with Business Insurance. We continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved slightly versus the prior year. While the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by more than 4 points.", "As always, there's some non-run rate items in the quarter, but 3 points of the improvement was driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trends.", "Net written premiums increased 5%, with the largest increase in Workers' Compensation, driven by higher rate and exposure in our guaranteed cost and National Account businesses.", "Turning to the production statistics, starting on Page 11. Overall retention was in line with recent periods at 80%. Pricing remains strong, with renewal premium change over 10%, and new business volume was up slightly from recent quarters.", "Drilling into the pricing results. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 8% and exposure of over 2%. The rate gains we achieved this quarter were up slightly from both the previous quarter and the first quarter of 2012. Rate increases ranged from 6% to 10% across all lines and were once again led by Workers' Compensation and Commercial Auto.", "As we've explained before, when comparing the quarter's data with prior periods, keep in mind that the data develops over time and can bounce around a bit, and this is especially true of exposure.", "On Slide 15, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012. This slide presents a summarized view of how we analyze the pricing and retention on our renewal book to ensure we are taking the right actions.", "The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratio, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing business, accounts with long-term loss ratio of less than 60%; and the bars on the right representing our worst performing businesses, that is accounts with long-term loss ratios exceeding 90%. The results show that retention is stronger for the better business and the rate change is dramatically higher on the poor performing accounts.", "I would emphasize that this is summarized data, so don't overanalyze the precision on the page. But what this data continues to tell us is that our underwriters are making the right targeted rate decisions, class by class, account by account.", "So with the continued improvement in pricing and loss trends holding across Business Insurance at about 4%, we continue to see meaningful margin expansion.", "In our Financial, Professional & International Insurance segment, the combined ratio for the quarter was 82.3%, an improvement of 5.5 points year-over-year. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly 4 points, driven by underwriting actions across the segment, along with increased rate in our Management Liability business. This marks the ninth consecutive quarter of improving underlying loss ratios for the segment.", "Net written premiums increased by 7% in the quarter, driven primarily by lower reinsurance cost across the segment. Gross written premium showed a modest increase of about 1% in the first quarter, driven by strong rate gains in our Management Liability book of business, partially offset by a slight decline in surety premium. All in, a great quarter for the segment.", "In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the first quarter of 2012, due to higher underlying underwriting margins, lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. The combined ratio for the quarter of 89.4% improved more than 8 points versus the first quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio showed more than a 3-point improvement year-over-year.", "Looking specifically at Auto, we continue to be very pleased with both pricing and retention, with renewal premium change of nearly 9% and retention at 81%, both in line with recent periods, while new business volume was down year-over-year. What these results demonstrate is that we've been successful in achieving rate increases on the renewal book, but our pricing actions have meaningfully impacted our new business, and we are watching this trend carefully.", "Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 94.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, reflecting the earned impact of the written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. It's important to remember that there's a significant amount of seasonality and losses for this line, and the first quarter loss ratio typically runs a little below the full year average. I would also note that the unfavorable prior year development in this line is due to a slight increase in our estimate of Sandy Auto claims.", "Regarding loss-cost trends, we've been talking to you about increasing bodily injury severity for more than a year, and we were encouraged that the bodily injury severity trend we saw this quarter remained consistent with what we have seen in the previous 2 quarters. In addition, earned pricing remains in excess of our current view of loss trend. And assuming loss trend remains at this level, we will see year-over-year Auto margins expand for the remainder of 2013.", "Looking at Homeowners. Pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at 12%, down slightly from the fourth quarter of 2012 but up more than 2 points year-over-year. Retention remains strong at 84%, while new business volume was meaningfully lower than the prior year quarter due to the execution of our pricing, underwriting and deductible strategies.", "The underlying combined ratio for the quarter of 81.1% improved more than 4 points over the prior year quarter, benefiting from a lower level of non-cat weather and fire losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss-cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result. But given the ongoing volatility of weather patterns, we will continue to implement improved underwriting pricing in terms and conditions.", "Overall in the segment, there was progress on the underlying fundamentals along with some benefit from the lower weather-related losses but still a work in process, and we'll continue to execute on our strategy in order to further improve our results.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Andre, we're ready for the question-and-answer segment. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just -- I have one question, Brian. In -- you talked about Personal lines, you talked about the rate gains you're getting both on the Homeowners and the Auto side. But I think in the Q, the outlook you mentioned that you expected profitability to be roughly in line with what you saw in 2012. Just trying to square those 2 items, and just one follow-up.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So -- and specifically, I just want to make sure, that's a Homeowners...", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I think you said in the Q, I think it's said the outlook for Personal lines, overall, was that profitability would be -- should be in line with 2012 or you would expect it to be in line with 2012. And just given that you're taking mid- to high-single digit, I think you said double-digit rate gains, I'm just trying to understand how -- why that number shouldn't be better next year than this year.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes. This is Jay Benet. What we tried to say in the Q was that what we had last year were various quarters that had favorable weather, favorable fire losses. And as you can easily understand in the Homeowners, it's very difficult to predict what a normal level of these things are. So thinking about what the outlook for the year was in Homeowners, our view was well, they were favorable last year, so whatever normal is this year, sounds like it should be a little higher. So despite having this underlying concept of rate exceeding some view of loss trend, and that's a pretty difficult concept when you get into a business that has so much of its losses tied up in weather and fire-type events, we do feel that there's an improvement in profitability coming about through pricing versus this concept of loss trend, but that improvement will be offset if these other levels of losses go back to whatever a\"normal\" is. So it's a very difficult equation, if you will, to try to come up with an outlook for that business but that was our best shot as it relates to Homeowners. And then on the Auto side, the view was a little marginal improvement based upon pricing, where it is today versus in that business a much better view as to what loss trend looks like. So...", "Jay S. Fishman", "A better meaning, more accurate, more predictable. Yes.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, yes. So looking at the 2 combined, one getting better, one if things go back to normal in Homeowners, who knows whether they will, getting a little less margin, the 2 of them should kind of offset and the profitability should be roughly at the same level.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Understood. Okay, great. And then just in Business Insurance, we certainly saw exposures kind of pick up in some of the reporting that you provided us with. Just trying to understand, so you've got -- so you've -- you're taking rate, you're expecting to continue to do that, your retention is not falling and you're seeing exposures lift. Is that exposures on the business that you had? Or is that potentially being impacted by new business or new endorsements on old business?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Michael, this is Brian. So the exposure numbers we show are all on our renewal book, for starters, driven by a whole bunch of things. In Property, for example, there's been a lot of movement to improve insurance to value. So that would -- we could have the exact same building but getting a different insurance to value on it, and that would be driving exposure up. It can be more employees in Workers' Comp. It could be more vehicles, more receipts on a GL rating, so it can be a whole -- all of those different things. As I mentioned in my comments, too, I would also point out that the granular nature of the exposure data, in particular on Commercial Accounts, moves around a bit, as premium audits come in, et cetera. So there is a lift there but maybe not as dramatically as some of that data shows. It moves around.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And the premium auto, it's been trending in which direction recently?", "Brian W. MacLean", "For the last several quarters, they've been pretty flat. They rose dramatically as we came out of the 2008-2009 time period. But for the -- yes, and clearly, it's positive. Premium audits have returned to the traditional couple points of positive on average.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So this is obviously a great quarter. And as we sort of -- as we work through results, we're starting to get -- see some players get more comfortable with margins. And obviously, Travelers has been the leaders thus far in raising pricing and talking about sort of accident years being not a target. I'm curious to get a sense of how far you think we may have to go on pricing. You're guiding to continued pricing in '13 in your outlook in the K -- in the Q and would love to get a sense of how much further accident year sort of margin expansion you think that the industry needs to get back to target.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Josh, it's Jay Fishman. I can't speak to the industry or any other company. I can tell you what we're doing. We're going to continue, and it's driven by 2 factors: First, the weather remains unpredictable and just more uncertain than it has in many years, and that's been the case for the last several years and that's been driving much of our action. But the other part is that as our investment portfolio continues to mature, the effect of reduced interest rates will continue to push the fixed portion of net investment income down over the next several years. We've provided those projections to you previously with -- or actually they're more than projections, they're almost the actual numbers, such as that bonds as they mature will be reinvested. So we will -- I would refer you back to that schedule to get some sense of that impact. So that net investment income will continue to decline for the next several years at least, unless interest rates change. The weather remains very unpredictable and uncertain, so we're going to keep going.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's helpful, Jay. The other thing that's surprising about this, just as a follow-up, a couple of years back, it was clear that it was easier to maintain margins and maintain sort of pricing in the soft market in the sort of smaller areas and in personal lines. But it sounds like if I'm interpreting what you guys are saying correctly that I think that there is more pricing momentum to continue in sort of the larger mid-market Commercial Accounts, National Accounts businesses as opposed to the smaller businesses in Personal lines. And I'm wondering if you can talk about one, I guess, if that's right but then also just sort of underlying what that -- sort of how those 2 different markets have diverged and what we all ought to understand about how they operate differently.", "Jay S. Fishman", "No worries. We tend to think of those markets really in 3 segments, and even that's an understatement of what's -- of what the real environment is, but we tend to think of small middle market individually underwritten accounts and then the National Accounts business. And certainly, over a long period of time, the competitive dynamics in the National Accounts arena, in particularly has been more dramatic than the level of competition in the smallest accounts. In fact, if I recall correctly, I don't think that renewal price change in our Select business actually ever went negative. We should check that but that's my recollection. I don't believe it ever did, and obviously, it did in middle markets. And for those who engage in the real National Accounts business, and I would observe that our participation in that segment is actually relatively modest, that's been the most competitive. So that's a historical framework, I think, around which to think of pricing. For what's happened over the last several years, we have been successful at passing along price increases, both in our small commercial business, as well as our middle market individually underwritten businesses. And I'm not sure that the differences in the ability to pass or at least as measured by rate gains or renewal price change in the small business, I don't think that there's been a significant difference in the ability to be successful in those 2 segments. The dynamics are quite different on the individually underwritten business, it's account by account. It is in many cases, loss driven. It's the experience of the individual account. In Select, you're dealing with class underwriting. And so you're dealing with -- think of it as one with personal lines, a price established for a class of business. So the nature of the underwriting decisions are different but the results are interesting in that we've been successful at getting rate gains in that small end, as well as the individually underwritten business that are largely in the aggregate the same. Do you want to talk about National Accounts at all? Or -- I'm looking at Brian.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I mean, National Accounts is a little bit more of a service model. A lot of what we do there, the majority of what we do on the casualty side is all loss responsive. And the market conditions have been such that our service capabilities have been viewed very favorably, and so the pricings improved there pretty dramatically. But -- and we've done really well there. So we feel good about -- we're not a large casualty risk taker in that space.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And that is an important distinction. We -- our -- even our National Accounts business, we'll write national property on a guaranteed cost basis, we'll do that. Our casualty business, both in terms of liability as well as, in particular Workers' Compensation, is largely in one fashion or another, a fee-for-service business where we are managing a claim on behalf of the clients. So we are not -- as one would think of a guaranteed cost risk taker in the larger end...", "Brian W. MacLean", "The risk we would take there would be excess [ph].", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, yes, exactly right. I hope that's helpful.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets.", "Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Just had a question about the Personal lines business and the change in PIF this quarter. While the retention seems to be holding constant on both the Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners, there's been a pretty significant decline in PIF year-over-year. Wondered if I could just get some more insight on it, just a rate change or a competitive dynamic shift?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so this is Brian. I'll start. We're clearly watching that closely. So obviously, in our statistics, you can see the renewal book is performing well. We feel great about that. The actions that we are taking and we believe it's very directly tied to the actions we're taking from a pricing, deductible, underwriting perspective, specifically on the last point there on Homeowners, is impacting our new business volumes and our competitive position in the marketplace. And like I said, we're watching it closely and we're going to continue to manage it. But we're committed to improving the profitability there. Jay?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, I think you've expressed it right. In the Homeowners business, our sense is and this is a more anecdotal than we can -- than factual. Our sense is, is that the increase in minimum deductibles, in particular, in not an insignificant number of states to really try and bring the policy back to its historical intent is having an impact on new business competitively. It had been our hope, I think, more than anything else that the weather changes that are -- that we're confronting, those are systemic. They're not unique to us. They are systemic in that any thoughtful underwriting-driven company would, in the long run, evaluate how you make a reasonable return in that business. So we've taken steps that we think makes sense for us. We're not going to allow our business to continue from a policy in force standpoint to decline in double digits for long without beginning to take other steps that we might have to take. Now one of those steps is not to reengage in the business and make substandard returns. So we'll have to wrestle with the strategy and how we implement that in the marketplace if what we're doing now strategically and tactically doesn't turn out to be competitively viable, and that's why Brian's comment that we will continue to watch this carefully.", "Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "And then I guess, just sort of a follow-up to that. Any thoughts on how the direct-to-consumer channel is sort of coming along? Or any growth plans to sort of push that line, either advertising or otherwise, accelerate the development of the business?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Not yet. We continue to -- the test that we're actually continuing to do internally, we refer to as Little America. Our Little America test is -- don't know whether it's 2 or 3 states, but we're actually doing pricing testing in those 2 states, taking states where our agency business was not nearly as prominent as other states, so we can determine the price elasticity of the product and what actions we take and what drives volumes. We're -- we also believe in learning about this that the notion of what I'll call traditional advertising, media-based advertising, that may have run its course. Meaning, we're just not convinced that taking a substantial amount of resources and applying it in traditional media channels actually is going to result in a growth strategy for a business. So we have been deeply exploring digital and the way to drive digital business around it, which we think, at least at this point, has more viability to it and a greater impact. So that's at least a learning in the process that it's possible that American eyeballs are just exhausted from auto insurance ads, and to become another name in that quest may not make a great deal of sense. And lastly, we watch with interest who responds, and we're always wrestling -- not wrestling, that's actually an incorrect word. We are evaluating, is perhaps better, the dynamic of who responds in that channel, the nature of the customer and always wanting to make sure that when we are ready to launch this more substantively, that we really understand the customer that's responding, and we like that customer. And so those are still learning points for us. And until we really feel comfortable that we know what we're doing and we have a likely successful outcome, we're going to keep testing and making sure we wire the thing up properly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "I guess 2 quick follow-up questions. First of all, if I look at Slide 14 for other Business Insurance, it seems that, that exposure rebounded meaningfully over the past few quarters. Can you just sort of delve a bit deeper into the cause for that?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so this is Brian. A decent amount of that business is property. So it's got our national property business there, it's got our marine businesses there. As I said, insurance to values improved pretty significantly there, so we've had some movement. And some of the other activity in oil and gas has moved there, so it's a couple of specific things. I wouldn't read robust economic growth into it.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. I guess, the only other question is going back to the charge regarding to the New York fund for reopened cases. Can you sort of just expand on that? And is that the fund, which will close at 1/1/2014? I guess, what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a possibility as more new claims come in, could there be further adjustments down the line?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Sure, you're welcome. It's Jay Fishman. And yes, this is the fund that will close 1/1/14 as a result of legislation undertaken in New York. And your question actually is quite relevant. The $42 million pretax that we've provided is an actuarial estimate of the amount of reopened claims that we otherwise would have been -- that would have been seatable to the fund. And as a consequence, we did not build into original loss estimates, loss picks, if you like, in our Workers' Compensation business. And now that's the best estimate we have, given all the data that we have of the amount that will no longer go back to the fund, so we have to provide for the reserve levels. And if in fact the reserve -- the claim activity is different from that actuarial estimate, yes, we will have a variance to that $42 million. Perspectively, it can go up or down, obviously. And -- but the answer to your question is yes, that's correct.", "Brian W. MacLean", "There isn't anything structural that will require us to take further action. If our estimate is right, we think we've appropriately assessed the liability.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "I was hoping we could flesh out the audit premiums impact during the quarter. I believe there was a component of healthy growth in at least 1 line. And I was curious if it benefits the combined ratio in a way that we should be cognizant of as well.", "Brian W. MacLean", "This is Brian. I'm thinking through the question for a second, but I don't think it has any impact on the combined. As we say on the pages of -- well, I'm looking at the Page numbers, 11, 12, 13, those are illustrative production statistics that we use in managing the business. And particularly in Commercial Accounts, how the true-ups of audit premiums flow through that data develops over time. But from a loss projection -- from a loss ratio perspective, I don't think it has any impact.", "Jay S. Benet", "I mean, without getting into the details of accounting, we have this thing called earned but unbilled amounts on the balance sheet that's trying to take into account everything we know about the particular policyholders that we have. So there's nothing really about the audit premiums per se that are going to drive a major change to the combined ratio at any given quarter. It's just all part of the entirety of the estimation process. And then as far as the overall level of audit premiums, this year in the first quarter versus last year, there really wasn't a significant change in the dollar amount. So as it relates to premium differentials from one quarter to the next, it's not driving that either.", "Jay S. Fishman", "We actually make an estimate and accrue on a regular basis the amount of estimated order premiums that we project. And then obviously, as each policy ends and each policy audit occurs, we will make an adjustment to that accrual, either up or down, depending on it. In the financial crisis, what happened, the reason that it became a more substantive issue was that we had never actually seen audit premiums go negative. We were not accruing on the premise that they would be negative so we had significant adjustments then relative to that. But now it's more consistent with historical patterns and is -- so in answer, no. I need to correct one thing I said earlier. I'm reminded by Bill Cunningham who is here. I said that I couldn't -- I didn't recall that select RPC had ever been negative. And in fact, it was. In the RPC in the fourth quarter of '08, it was the -- the others were third quarter of '08, first quarter of '09, it was flat. But fourth quarter of '08, it was modestly negative. So apologies for sort of my memory not being perfect on that.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "That's very helpful. And lastly, so I see -- the Travelers stock valuation has increased fairly meaningfully. I noticed that share repurchases plus the dividend lag net income by a fair amount this quarter. Is that due to the debt repayment? Or should we -- or is there a change in philosophy, perspectively?", "Jay S. Benet", "No, there's no change in philosophy. As we've said before, there's a lot of timing differentials that take place, as to when you earn the money, what moneys are up at the holding company versus in the operating company, but there's absolutely no change in philosophy.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gregory Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "You guys are actually sitting at your targeted ROEs at least for 1 quarter. So I'm wondering does that -- how does that shift your thinking in terms of managing the business? You're -- even in a low interest rate world, you're getting where you want to be. So how did things change?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes. Greg, we reflect again sort of the same comment I made earlier. The fact is, is that on an accident-year basis, excluding the favorable reserve development, we are not at that level, are going to compounded by the fact that investment income in the fixed portfolio will continue to decline. That's a certainty, unless rates change. And then the third piece is, is that weather remains very unpredictable and the fact that we had favorable non-cat weather in one quarter is certainly not enough for us to conclude that anything is different. So our analysis is largely the same, and so we're going to continue to keep pushing.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. So in a way, you're basically normalizing all that stuff when you talk about that mid-teens over time?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We -- I'm glad you said it. The slide is clear, it says mid-teens ROE over time. And I said several quarters ago that, that was not achievable in this environment. And on an accident year basis, I still don't believe that it really is. And as a consequence, we were going to leave it in place as an aspirational goal, I think are the exact words that we use. And that's where we sit today. And as a consequence, we'll continue to push.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then perhaps the only negative thing in a very strong quarter was just -- or just some clarification around the Workers' Comp reserve side. I understand the onetime charge, but there were no releases anywhere across the book in Workers' Comp. I'm wondering is that the first time that you haven't released from Workers' Comp reserves? And should we be concerned that the last couple years have developed unfavorably there?", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay Benet. What I did say was that there was no change, really, in Workers' Comp. I mean, this is the first quarter of the year, and Workers' Comp has a long tail line, as you know. So we're not -- while we look at everything on a quarterly basis, we don't necessarily have adjustment to all of our reserves on a quarterly basis. So I wouldn't read into that other than we put up reserves in the fourth quarter and we still feel very good about where those reserves are, and we'll see how they develop going forward.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'd make an observation even though it's not the question that you're necessarily asking. We're sure that somebody was going to ask us about frequency in Workers' Compensation and the loss trend and kind of where things are in that regard, just reflecting back on our comment a couple of -- I think it was actually 2 years ago, 1.5 years, 2 years ago, which is that the frequency dynamic has indeed returned back to its long-term trend line, which is really good. It was the blip that we saw. I think it was in '10. We attributed it to late filed claims, as a result of the financial crisis. But that frequency line has now returned back to its long-term trend line. There's absolutely no guarantee that it will stay there. It may change next quarter, but we were just prepared for that question. We thought someone would ask. So we feel actually quite good about the Workers' Compensation business. We obviously do have a view on what the accident year returns are in the Workers' Comp line across all the businesses, and we are very much on track there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Langen McAlenney.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Brian, I know you said not to microscope Slide 15 of the deck on the pricing changes by band. But I'm just curious, for the middle band, retention is down a decent bit versus a year ago, where the -- with the outside bands, it's improved a little bit. I'm not sure it matters, but I'm just curious, do you have any theory what's going on there?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, I think so. So part of it -- the honest answer to that is probably the middle bar there, in blue, was a little too high a year ago. And as we looked at marketplace opportunity and the profitability on that business, that's 60% to 90% loss ratio business. There's a wide band within that. So as I -- as we try to emphasize, this is a real simplification of how we look at it. And in every one of our businesses, it's at least quintiles. In many, it's deciles. And we're looking at all the stuff in between. So I wouldn't read too much into that dip. A piece of it was I think as we looked at the data a year ago, we began to execute more granularly there and push on the right account. So we actually feel good about the progress there.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Bill Cunningham actually a year ago said that there was real opportunity or so he thought, particularly in that -- in the right side of this graph the over-90 segment. And if you take a look at what's happened since, it's just -- I mean, the results are just -- you couldn't have scripted them much better. Retention remains at relatively, let's call them, low levels but rate is even higher. So again, just an analytical validation of the strategic and operational approach that he described a year ago.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "Right, very helpful. And then just a quick follow-up on the direct business. I mean, your statutory underwriting loss there actually declined pretty significantly this quarter. Clearly, part of it was driven by less expense spend. And I'm just wondering relative to your comments earlier, might we be looking for kind of a new base line underwriting result there, thinking about it holistically?", "Jay S. Fishman", "The result very specifically is a function of reduced national media spending, advertising. As we pursue this Little America strategy, and Greg shared with me it is 2 states, that our media and digital spending has been very targeted because we're trying to generate activity and results in those states so we can learn about price elasticity. And as a consequence, the aggregate amount of spending is down. I wouldn't overreact on a permanent strategic analysis as to what we've been doing these last few quarters. This is a very targeted moment for us to determine pricing sensitivity. And as a result, less advertising spending is needed to generate the results.", "Larry Greenberg - Langen McAlenney", "So there's no top-down decision at this point that we want to cut our losses, not eliminate them, but we want to bring down our underwriting loss from this initiative?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, no, no. Quite the contrary. We remain -- the best way to answer is we remain committed to the strategy. And as I've said before, we want to make sure that we know that we have a financial success. It is far easier -- I'm not saying easy, but it's easier to have a marketing success and a financial disappointment, and we are guarding carefully against that. And as a result, we want to make sure that not only do we have a pricing profile that is competitive for our brand, but that the pricing strategy there can produce a reasonable return. So that -- it just takes time for sales to occur, losses to emerge and to evaluate the performance of the business. And I mean, we are in no rush. There's -- we're just not. There'll always be another 25-year-old generation that's coming of age that needs insurance, and I -- it's -- granted there's certainly activity today. But we feel strongly, having years and years ago now had a marketing success and a financial disappointment that we're just not going to go down that path. And we just -- just urgency is not -- to go quickly is not the measure here, it's to go successfully.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Question on reserves and the commentary that the legal environment is better than expected in the '10 to '12 accident years. I just was wondering that's still -- we're seeing that across a bunch of companies but it's still surprising to me that the legal environment was so good in that time, given the economy. So I'd appreciate any color on kind of your thoughts on why that's been the case. Why you've had less exposure legal-wise on casualty lines in that period of time?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "This is Doreen Spadorcia. I'll try and answer your question. I'll tell you, we had exactly the same assumption. When the economy started to turn, we were worried about not only that but political environment. So we watched down to the county, what's happening around jury award settlements, et cetera, et cetera. And the best I can give you is we think that the financial crisis probably encouraged people to want their dollars faster. And so there were opportunities for settling some cases that maybe in the past they would have waited to see what the amount would have been. We also took very targeted approaches in certain jurisdictions that we thought we had the ability to set some good precedence. But we've just found that the willingness for people settling has been they want to do that sooner rather than later. Whether that will continue, I don't know. We've also seen cases that have gone to verdict. We saw, again, that there might be some views that this is a bad economy, people need the money, where people on the jury have said, \"This is a lot of money given this economy.\" So even the things that have gone to verdict on some of the kind of GL and other things, they've been more reasonable than we anticipated going into this kind of economic environment. But again, that's just our view.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "But it's not for a lack of effort by the -- on the part of the trial bar though, right? I mean, they're very well kind of financed right now and very aggressive. So it's more people wanting their liquidity. Is that -- I guess, that's the takeaway?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I can tell you there's a lot of advertising still for the plaintiffs bar, looking for different kinds of cases. There's unique financing tools that people are using around big kinds of lawsuits. So you're right in that regard. I just can tell you what we're seeing. So I don't know if that's across the board.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "That's very helpful. Just one more on reserves. And that is on -- it was '10 to '12 that developed most favorably from the commentary but not kind of '08 and '09 and prior. So time marches on and those years are getting seasoned. Is it -- are we getting to the point now where kind of the '08 in prior accident years kind of stopped giving as much from a redundancy perspective?", "Jay S. Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I just -- we -- I'll answer the question by saying, every time we provide information on reserves, it's our best estimate and we don't have a crystal ball as to how these things are going to develop. I think that if you think of the arithmetic associated with reserving, as years mature, more and more claims are paid, more and more claims are settled. So it's logical to believe that as the accident years mature, there's going to be less development, but you just have to wait and see how these things actually take place. I mean, we certainly carry IBNR for all the years you mentioned. And sometimes, you have large cases that you think are going to cost you x, and they cost you less or more, whatever. So we just have to see. But I think essentially, the less IBNR you have, the less uncertainty you have, all things being equal, the less development you'll have.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Some of -- this is Jay Fishman. Some observers in the -- of the industry spend a lot of time commenting about reserve development from hard years, hard cycles or soft years or soft cycles, and people who embrace that thinking can come to view that particular years will be more productive than others. We just -- we don't agree with -- at least for us, I'll speak about Travelers. We just don't believe that, we don't do it. We make our best estimates all the time. They are estimates for loss -- for loss estimates are not driven by the revenue strength of that business. They're just not. And so we don't look at any years necessarily as being more potentially productive than others. And as an old year rolls off a new year comes on, and it just keeps going. So it's -- we just don't spend a lot of time obsessing about individual accident years and what they're producing.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Randy, it's Alan Schnitzer. I would also add to Doreen's response that over that period of time that you mentioned, we also had other developments like the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act that was really pro-defendant and made some cases harder to bring. Other developments like the Class Action Fairness Act, there's been some important cases in the Supreme Court that I think have been some setbacks in some cases for the trial bar. So I think all those things contribute. We, for example, just had an important win at the Supreme Court on an interpretation of the Class Action Fairness Act, in Standard Fire versus Knowles. And so the cases go both ways, of course. But I think if you look back over the last 5 or 6 years, you'd -- probably on balance and maybe just at the margin, but on balance, a slightly improving environment from the defense side.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "My question had been answered.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vincent DeAugustino with KBW.", "Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Back to one of your earlier comments about Auto loss-cost trends maybe stabilizing a bit. I'm just curious if you think that this is going to drive -- just that the new found rate competition in the Personal Auto industry. I mean, to your earlier comments, maybe not with Travelers. But is that something you might be able to expect the industry to ramp up on?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, it's Jay Fishman, then I'm going to turn it over to Brian. But my comment about loss stabilization was -- at least mine was specific to Workers' Compensation and it was a frequency comment, where we had seen a tick up in frequency, and it generated a lot of questions over the last several quarters. So I was just commenting that, that, frequency trend was now back in line.", "Brian W. MacLean", "And maybe you're referring, Vince, back to my comment where I was talking about Auto severity. And so just to be crystal clear, we had been seeing for -- and this goes back a little over a year ago now, we started talking about a ramp-up in Auto severity. The good news is that, that has leveled off third quarter, fourth quarter this quarter at about the same level but it is still higher than historical norms, so it's not the -- the rate of increase isn't increasing anymore, but we still got severity trend.", "Jay S. Fishman", "That's actually an important point. When we say leveled off, we don't mean that severity has gone to 0.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Sure.", "Jay S. Fishman", "What we mean is that the rate of increase is more consistent with our own expectations, and to some extent, historical trends, but it is still increasing.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. So we would -- we obviously don't know what our competitors are planning to do. We do know that the line, the Personal Auto line of business, has gone from a 94 to 102 combined in the last 6 years in an -- for the industry, in an environment with declining infrastructures. So from a return perspective, it's not the healthiest line of business for the industry. And we do look at the publicly available rate filings of our competitors, and that may indicate some movement upward in pricing, but we'll see what actually happens in the marketplace.", "Vincent M. DeAugustino - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then winter storm Nemo was -- I mean, at least from a Northeastern standpoint, it was a fairly large storm event but we haven't heard anything about Nemo from really anybody yet this quarter. So is it safe to assume that from an industry standpoint, or for Travelers standpoint that, that was basically a nonevent?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "[indiscernible] Is the cat 96 [ph]?", "Brian W. MacLean", "I think yes.", "Jay S. Fishman", "96 [ph], yes. Cats, 96 [ph], I believe.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Yes, let me just -- I'm going to look that up really quickly.", "Gabriella Nawi", "You know what, in the meantime, why don't we go to the next caller, and then we'll come back on that.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Brian, Jay, I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about your distribution. And kind of what their mood is right now. We're going to the third year of price increases, are they just getting tired of it? Are they accepting of it? What's kind of the new reaction?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, I think the numbers largely tell the story of where [ph] it will go. The senior team here spends a lot of time with agents and with brokers. If you had to do a short summary, you'd say on the commercial line side, the agents feel terrific. They're just -- they're feeling really good and really supported and solid. They believe that they can talk to their customers, explain the rationale. The best remind their customers how long pricing went down and actually do a pretty good job comparing, where even in a lifted environment how that compares to historical premiums. And so they're feeling pretty good. I don't know if you agree with that, Brian, but that...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, I do. And we've spent -- in recent weeks, we've been out with agents a lot and talked to a lot of them. I think, again, not to overemphasize the data on Slide 15, but how we execute in the marketplace and really doing it on a granular basis works with them. The more we're having specific conversations about accounts or classes of business, the more focused that is, the better it will be received. The more it's viewed as just a broad-brush approach to the marketplace, the more challenging it will be.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And on the personal line side, what we're hearing from them is what you see in the numbers, which is that our minimum -- our change in minimum deductibles, our change in underwriting or to some extent, our changes in rate are making us -- causing us to be less competitive on new business. They share with us that the renewal book is fine. And I would say -- I don't know that, that really reflects the mood, but this is a conversation that we have with producers and agents all the time that they're certainly confirming to us that for the moment, the strategies that we're taking in home and in Auto, on the new business side, I would say only, on the new business side only, at least for the moment, is causing us to be less competitive than historically we've been. And we certainly listen to that. We see it in the numbers, and no great surprise to us at the moment.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Just -- and so just to circle back on the previous question, just a couple quick comments on the big winter storm that we had a couple months ago. We've clearly gotten some claim volume out of that. It hasn't been outsized. It was obviously contemplated in what we booked in the quarter. A couple of comments: From an Auto perspective, at least up here in Connecticut, Massachusetts and the Northeast, they really shut down the roads a lot, so there wasn't a lot of activity. And the type of claims that we get, the really damaging winter storm claims we get tend to be when there is either really extended events, when the snow sits for months on top of roofs and you get damage there or you get collapses. And fortunately, in this event, although we got lots and lots of snow in a short period of time, it warmed up. It got cleared. And so it just wasn't a tremendous event for at least us, and it doesn't appear to have been in the industry either. So...", "Gabriella Nawi", "All right. We will -- it looks that this concludes our call for -- I don't think we have any more questions in the queue. So if anybody has further questions, as always, Andrew Hersom and I are available in Investor Relations. Thank you, and have a good day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference for today.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, July 23, 2013. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Andre. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our second quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it up for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "We're very pleased with our results this quarter, posting record net income per share of $2.41. We are particularly gratified that this is another quarter which demonstrates the very successful execution of the pricing strategy in commercial lines, which we embarked on nearly 3 years ago. Our granular active approach to improving profitability has been very successful. The aggregate rate and retention data that we showed -- that we show you for our commercial businesses demonstrate the success, but the data underneath tells an even more powerful story of improvement in profitability. This is important, and Brian will take you through that in more detail.", "But let me share with you that underlying margin improvement in our commercial businesses since 2011, which we achieved primarily through earned rate, our renewal business exceeding loss trend has, as of now, generated an increase in after-tax operating income of $650 million on an annualized basis. If we include Personal Insurance, and more to say on personal lines in a minute, the increase is more than $1 billion.", "Importantly, we have done so without disruption to our agents or customers. The relevant question now is where do we go from here?", "Since 2005, we have maintained a financial goal of producing a mid-teens operating return on equity over time. The over time aspect of the goal allows us to maintain the objective even when conditions are such that returns at that level are not immediately achievable on an accident year basis such as now. If you adjust our year-to-date operating return on equity of 15% to more of an accident year look by excluding the impact of net favorable prior year development, as well as the impacts of the favorable tax and legal resolutions, the adjusted ROE is approximately 8.5%.", "Also, to achieve a mid-teens operating ROE over time, there will be years where we must exceed the target because there will be other years when, due to any number of factors, we will fall below. So it is clear that we have more work to do to achieve our objective, and as a consequence, our strategy remains intact. We will continue to execute for improved returns, just as we have been doing.", "In Personal Insurance, we have also had a strategy of improving profitability through higher pricing. What has become apparent to us in the auto insurance line is that the combination of the rapid adoption of the comparative rater technology in independent agents offices, which now is the source of the substantial amount of the quotes that we issue and changing consumer expectations for this product have impacted our new business volume meaningfully.", "Consequently, we have concluded that to improve profitability and to create long-term value, we must have a more competitively priced product. By leveraging technology and taking other actions, we will make substantive changes to our business processes that we expect will allow us to meaningfully reduce costs without impacting service or quality.", "Brian will take you through the details, but through these actions we expect to be able to more competitively price our product and improve our profitability. Before I hand it over to Jay, I'd like to comment on our announcement in June that we agreed to acquire the Dominion of Canada. This was a strategic move, providing us with meaningful scale and market position in Canada. We are enthusiastic about the opportunity and are looking forward to welcoming the Dominion employees to Travelers.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thanks very much, Jay. Let me start by saying how pleased we all are with the second quarter and year-to-date results. And I do want to correct one thing Jay said, on Page 21 of the webcast, we do have a reconciliation of the operating return on equity year-to-date as reported of 15%. And when you do adjustment in net favorable prior year development and the favorable tax and legal settlements, it's actually 11.5%, would be -- what we consider to be the accident year kind of run rate of that. But with that, our liquidity and capital positions remain very strong, and we continue to generate capital in excess of what we need to support our businesses. Operating cash flows of approximately $722 million for the quarter and $1.3 billion year-to-date were also very strong, notwithstanding the cat losses that remain very high relative to historical standards although it's significantly below the corresponding prior year periods.", "We maintained our strong cash position, ending the quarter with holding company liquidity of just over $2 billion, after returning $491 million of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $300 million. Our strategy of returning excess capital to our shareholders remains unchanged. As we've stated in the past, the combination of dividends to common shareholders and common share repurchases will likely not exceed operating income over time. And in any given period, the difference between operating income and the level of dividends and share repurchases will also be a matter of timing. I'd remind you also the amount of common share repurchases will also depend on a variety of additional factors, including corporate and regulatory requirements, maintaining capital levels commensurate with the company's ratings, our share price, pension funding needs, strategic initiatives and other market conditions.", "We've included an overview of our cat reinsurance coverage on Page 20 of the webcast, which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year.", "Effective May 16, we entered into another 3-year reinsurance agreement with long-term -- Long Point Re III in which they issued $300 million of cat bonds, providing us with Northeast hurricane coverage on a specified -- on specified lines of business subject to a $1.25 billion retention, after which we can recover up to $300 million on a proportional basis until covered losses reach $1.8 billion.", "Effective July 1, we renewed our gen cat treaty with terms that look similar to last year, an attachment point of $1.5 billion and with covered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion level -- layer.", "Also effective July 1, we renewed our $600 million Northeast gen cat treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as in the prior year. Given the current reinsurance pricing environment, all of this was accomplished at a cost that was lower than the prior year. A more complete description of our cat reinsurance coverage, which also includes a description of our gen cat aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, is included on our second quarter 10-Q, which we filed earlier today, as well as in our 10-K. All of our capital ratios remained at or better than our target levels, and we ended the quarter with a debt-to-total capital ratio of 20.1%. Due to the recent rise in interest rates, net unrealized investment gains decreased by $1.2 billion after-tax in the quarter, driving a 2% reduction in book value per share in the quarter or 1% year-to-date.", "This impact of higher interest rates more than offset the very positive impact on book value per share of our strong earnings, which was the major driver of the change in adjusted book value per share. Adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter and 5% year-to-date. I would note that the rise in interest rate does have a positive side. Going forward, if interest rates stay at their current levels, we'll be able to reinvest proceeds from maturing bonds at higher yields than we were previously assuming. I would point out though that at current interest rate levels, this will still result in a reduction in future net investment income, just not as much. The rise in interest rates also led to an $87 million after-tax realized investment gain this quarter due to our use of U.S. Treasury futures to shorten the duration of the investment portfolio. At the beginning of the year, given the interest rate environment and the economic outlook, we decided to increase our short position from its then nominal amount of $800 million. The position was increased to $2 billion by the end of the first quarter and further increased to as much as $2.7 billion before the position was closed by the end of the second quarter due to our outlook for interest rates versus the carrying cost of this strategy.", "Lastly, I'd also like to point out that the rise in interest rates has not been significant enough to impact our pricing strategy in any meaningful way.", "So Brian is now going to provide some further comments on operating results.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Jay, just let me interrupt one second, if I may. I understand I misspoke and I know you corrected it, but because it is so important, please just let me reiterate that the adjusted ROE on what I described as the more of an accident look is 11.5%. If I said 8.5%, it was indeed just simply an error on my part. It's 11.5%. Thank you. Brian, I apologize.", "Brian W. MacLean", "No problem. Thanks, Jay. I'll go right to the segment results, beginning with Business Insurance, where we continue to be extremely pleased with the fundamentals of the business.", "The combined ratio for the quarter of 96.2% improved nearly 7 points versus the prior year, while the underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved over 3 points.", "Looking at production results for the segment on Page 9, retention and renewal premium change were both strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and nearly 9%, respectively, while new business volume was down slightly from the first quarter. Over the last 6 quarters, the production trends have been remarkably stable with retention running consistently around 80%, renewal price change between 8 and 10 points and rate around 7% to 8%.", "Slides 10 through 12 show a basically similar story of consistency for each of the businesses within the segment, and in each case, the compounding effect of rate increases is driving a meaningful improvement in our combined ratios. So the aggregate production results remain strong but as we've mentioned many times, the aggregate numbers alone don't tell the entire story. In fact, the detail of where we are getting the rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our pricing strategy.", "On Slide 13, we show our commercial accounts rate change and retention data for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the second quarter of 2012. The data is segmented by the individual account's long-term loss ratios, with the bars on the left representing our best-performing accounts and the bars on the right representing our worst performing accounts.", "We've shown this data before and I want to emphasize that it's a summarized version and the analytics we actually used to manage the business are at a much more granular level. The results show that for our better accounts, retention was very strong and rate change was solid and consistent with the year ago. For our core performing business, rate increases were up significantly year-over-year while retention was down meaningfully.", "Additionally, as you evaluate our results, keep in mind that our rate actions over the past 3 years have improved the returns in each of these loss ratio bands. So in fact, although the aggregate pricing improvements are very consistent over the past 6 quarters, an analysis of the underlying data reveals that our execution has, in fact, improved over time and is contributing to higher levels of profitability. So overall, in Business Insurance, very encouraging picture. The earned impact of these rate gains, along with loss trend across the segment that continues to run at about 4%, drove meaningful margin expansion. Going forward, our emphasis is continue to improve returns through maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level.", "In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income for the quarter was down 15% year-over-year due to higher catastrophe losses and less favorable prior year development. The cat losses in the quarter were primarily due to the unprecedented flooding in Alberta, Canada. Excluding cats and prior year development, the underlying combined ratio of 89.9% for the segment was strong and improved more than 2 points year-over-year. This improvement was driven largely by expanding margins in our Management Liability business, along with the impact of recent underwriting initiatives across the segment. Written premium was up slightly compared to the prior year quarter, driven by strong surety results, continued favorable rate in Management Liability and new business in international, partially offset by higher levels of written [ph] premiums.", "In June, we were pleased to announce our agreement to acquire the Dominion of Canada. The combined business will benefit from Travelers' sophistication in the use of data and analytics, as well as claim and risk control capabilities. The Dominion's extensive distribution network provides us with an exceptional platform for expanding our commercial lines business in Canada. In combining Travelers of Canada surety, Management Liability and commercial middle market products with the Dominion's commercial and personal portfolios, we'll create an organization with significant product breadth and a balanced mix of business. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2013, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.", "In Personal Insurance, operating income was up significantly versus the second quarter of 2012 due to lower levels of catastrophe losses and higher underlying underwriting margins. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter showed a 3-point improvement year-over-year with about 2 points driven by earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.", "Looking specifically at Auto production trends, retention of 80% and renewal premium change of over 8% were both in line with recent periods. Net written premium and new business volumes were down year-over-year as a result of our pricing actions.", "Turning to Auto profitability. The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was an improvement of over 1 point versus the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting the earned impact of the rate -- written rate gains we have achieved over the past several quarters. Loss cost trends for Auto remain consistent with recent quarters, with mix adjusted frequency continuing to be benign and severity stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity this quarter remained in line with what we've seen in the previous 3 quarters.", "In Homeowners, pricing was also very strong, with renewal premium change coming in at over 11%. Retention was consistent at 83%, while new business volume was down slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 81.5% in the quarter, an improvement of over 3 points year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a lower level of non-cat weather losses, along with earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends. So a very strong underwriting result, and we are beginning to see the positive impact of our underwriting and pricing actions.", "So overall, a very good quarter. But as Jay mentioned in his opening comments, the personal auto marketplace is changing. We remain committed to offering a product that is both competitively priced and delivers an appropriate return for our shareholders. And accordingly, we are taking expense reduction actions that will allow us to improve both pricing competitiveness and product returns.", "Specifically, we expect to reduce our claim and other insurance expenses, such that we realize a savings of $140 million pretax when fully implemented. This represents about a 10% reduction in our unallocated claim and other insurance expense base in Personal Insurance. We will begin realizing some of these savings immediately and they will be fully realized in 2015. The savings will be achieved through the consolidation of certain operations, along with other efficiency gains throughout the business.", "The majority of the savings will be driven by staff reductions, primarily through attrition, but we will also be giving notice to approximately 450 employees this week. We expect to take a restructuring charge of about $16 million, $10 million of which is expected to be incurred in the third quarter of 2013. While some of these savings will be realized in our Homeowners business, the majority of the impact will be in Auto, and these actions are clearly aimed at improving our strategic position in that line. We are pleased with the progress we've made in the personal lines business and we believe these actions will allow us to offer an even more competitive product in a challenging marketplace.", "I'll now turn it over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Brian. Before we open it for questions, I'd like to note that the management team is participating from several different locations this morning, so please bear with us as we coordinate our responses. With that, Andre, can we open it up for questions, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Two quick questions. First, it relates to pricing. In terms of the Business Insurance pricing trends, I'm looking at the renewal rate change. Do you think, based on where we are and what rates we have achieved in the past, does the RRC and Business Insurance, does it stay somewhat flattish from here? Or does it change meaningfully from here?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So let me start. This is Brian MacLean. Let me start with an answer and then, Jay or Jay, chime in. I -- the first observation I'd make is when we look at the actual results, so we're not going to go far out in the crystal ball world, but if we look at the actual results over the last 6 quarters, from Page 10, it's incredibly stable. The red line there of renewal rate change is basically rounding off of 7.5% for all of those quarters. So what we saw in the quarter was very consistent with where we've been. Our view about it -- I would want to emphasize what we said in the presentation, that we don't have a target and it's not necessarily about attaining a specific level of rate gain, it's about achieving returns. So we're looking very granularly and obviously trying to retain the best business and drive the price increases on the weaker stuff. There can be a -- next quarter, a rate change number identical to the one that we just have, which might be generating much better returns or much worse, depending on where you get it. So we're very focused on the segmentation. As far out as we're going to go is what we saw in the quarter was very consistent. June was a pretty strong month. July looks like it's trending pretty consistently, but where the market's going to be in 3, 4, 5 months, we'll all see. But we haven't seen anything in our results that would say that the market is about to shift dramatically and the fundamental situation with interest rates and weather volatility continues.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Brian, would you agree that over the last 3 years as more of the Commercial Business has moved from the right side to the left side, and as a consequence, more as in the higher margin rather than the lower margin business? That achieving a flat rate in that same environment is actually net underneath an actual improvement.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. And what you mean by flat rate is 7.5% round number rate increase?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Correct. It's really the rate applied to the mix that is the important factor here.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Right. When we look at our granular execution and the impact of now a couple of years of rate increases on the portfolio, we feel the round numbers, 80% retention, 7.5% rate we're getting today, is producing a much better result than the 80% and 7.5% renewal rate change we were getting 1.5 years ago. So we feel very good about it.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Got it. That's helpful. I'm sorry, go ahead.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I was just going to say, but don't see any major shifts in what's going on in the market.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Yes. One quarter does not make a trend, but we'll see. The only other question I had is on...", "Jay S. Fishman", "I will just make an observation. It's not one quarter. It's been a lot of quarters. And just an observation as to the data. That's all.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Yes. The other question was on Dominion, Dominion's business mix and a combined ratio. And I know it's a bit too early. Just looking at their business mix and their combined ratios, could you just sort of broadly talk about what your strategy might be and how it might differ versus the current strategy?", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Sure. Amit, it's Alan Schnitzer. But when you're talking about the current strategy, I'm not sure exactly which one you're asking.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "I'm talking about the combined ratios, 106.1% for 2012, and their top line is $1.2 billion. Just sort of broader thoughts on that going forward. How does that change? Does it change near term? Or does it take somewhat longer to turn that around?", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Sure. Let me take a stab at that. So stepping back, the transaction really is a strategic transaction for us. It gives us important scale and competitive position in a big market that currently we're -- we don't have either in. So from a strategic perspective, we think it's important. In terms of what's driving that combined ratio, a lot of that is their personal lines Auto business. And we think that when we bring our data and analytics and claim expertise to that marketplace, we can -- and it'll take some time, but we think we can substantially improve that result. Also, they've got a small commercial platform that we like a lot. We think we can bring our expertise and analytics from that business into that marketplace. And one of the real benefits for us in this transaction is that they've got a terrific distribution platform in Canada, and we like the opportunity to expand our commercial middle market products through their distribution. So we think that there is good premium growth in the platform from that. So -- and looking overall in international, we've been, certainly over the last couple of years, focused on investing in that business and managing the loss side, which we've done very effectively over the last couple of years. So we're very confident that when we apply that same expertise to the Dominion, we'll be able to have positive effects on that. One of the impacts of what we've been doing for a couple of years is the expense ratio has ticked up, both from investing in people and data and analytics and also from, over the years, having shed some premium that didn't meet the risk and reward calculation for us. So the additional volume that comes on from Dominion really helps us from the expense side as well. So that's really sort of the outlook and the strategic positioning of the transaction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "In regards to margins, in the press release, I noticed that low levels of large losses were cited at -- within the international segment. And I also noticed that lower levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses were cited in personal lines. So I guess, does that mean we should build some margin cushion into our forward estimates given non-cat level large losses have been running below historical averages? Or am I thinking about that wrong -- the wrong way?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes. This is Jay Benet. As we've said in previous quarters, any individual quarter is going to be impacted by things that go well beyond the general flow of earned rate versus what you'd consider to be the underlying loss trend. Now we spike out at least verbally because that's probably as good as it's going to get. We have things like large loss activity and some view as to, with the non-cat weather, favorable or unfavorable relative to the prior year and we try to give you that perspective. What we always suggest you do is look at the longer-term view as to what the combined ratio looks like x cat and few ID [ph], and with those words around and what others say, try to get a view as to what the weather looks like and build that into your models. I hope that's helpful because that's probably as granular as we can get with it.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. Yes, it just stood out because I know in 2Q of last year, you also cited lower levels of large losses.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, because the other thing you could do is we wrestle with this as well. So we try to put some words into the outlook within the 10-Q that might also be helpful.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. Last question, in regards to investment income levels. I noticed the portfolio's average pretax yield actually rose a bit sequentially to 3.9%. And I think you cited duration increasing. Can you comment on how we should perspectively think about those dynamics, given the recent increases in new money rates?", "William H. Heyman", "Well, I think what -- it's Bill Heyman. I'd go first to what Jay said earlier and that is the recent increase in market rates obviously permits us to put new money out at better rate than we were before, but still at rates below the book yields on maturing securities. So I think I would simply take the projections which Jay has made in the past of net investment income going out 2, 3, 4 years and tweak them for this increase in rates, and frankly, I wouldn't tweak them much. If this is -- if what we have seen in June is all we're going to see in 2013 and some will think that may be the case, I wouldn't make major changes in projections.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, if I could add a couple of things. The -- we talked about the short position in treasury futures. And by eliminating that at the end of the quarter, that had an impact of slightly expanding the duration of the portfolio. Having said that, too the rise in interest rates also expands the duration of the portfolio, given the expected impact on bonds that would be called or not called under that circumstance. So the change in duration is really not a structural change at all in the portfolio. And as Bill just said, the rise in interest rates would have a fairly moderate impact on the reinvestment yields so -- given how much is rolling over versus what's enforced. And in our 10-Q, in the outlook section, we talk about all of this having an impact that would suggest about $25 million less in after-tax net investment income off of the fixed income portfolio per quarter going forward, if interest rates stay where they are, and I think before we said the out number was about $30 million. So it's a relatively modest impact.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And Jay, I would just make some one observation. You just -- you mentioned in passing that the gain was attributable to closing the position. That's actually not completely correct because it's a mark-to-market position, so whether we had closed it or not closed it, the gain would have been there. We closed it because of our expectations of interest rates and the relative cost of carrying the position. But the position is a daily mark-to-market position.", "Jay S. Benet", "That's entirely right. Thanks for correcting that, Jay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So obviously, we've all been very impressed for the past couple of years with your pricing leadership, pricing approaching, I guess, 20% at this point. You've helpfully done the math for us in 11% or 12% x your ROE. And there's obviously still some pricing yet to earn in and rates are moving higher and so I think we're all sort of sitting out here just scratching our heads, trying to figure out how much longer pricing will continue. You've given us some guidance, which is helpful in your Q. And I'm wondering if you can just expand the math a bit and give us a sense when you've actually worked with your actuaries and meet with your insurance regulators, and share them with your indications, how much more rate in some of your major segments do you actually need to take at these levels?", "Jay S. Benet", "Jay, you want to start or...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, I was just taking about how to do that. First, I -- we've always said that one of the things we can't do is to, in any way, is to project or speculate competitive reactions. So just because we articulate pretty clearly what we intend to do, it certainly doesn't mean that it's going to happen or that we approach it with that certainty. But nonetheless, we continue to have a space to go. We've been saying for the longest time, and I take some pride in the fact that the objective, the financial objective, that we articulated now some 8 years ago is one that we stayed with consistently. It's not been remanufactured to be convenient to the environment. It is what we think long-term returns in our business should be and hopefully can be again. But our goal is to get back to the mid-teens return on equity over time, and at 11.5% now on an accident year basis, round numbers, we still have a ways to go. Not all products are the same, very important. Not all businesses are the same. And as a consequence, not all pricing strategies are the same. We talk all the time about the analytic grid that demonstrates high to low returns and our emphasis on pricing relative to that. But every time you take a step up, it changes, whether you're talking about an individual product line like Workers' Comp or property or whether you're talking about a particular business like construction versus our surety business. So the strategies are all quite different and they are all return-driven. But in the aggregate, we are going to continue to push as long as we can, until such time as we bring ourselves back to the long-term objective. And I think that's probably about as clear as we can be. I -- we've resisted, even internally setting artificial goals or targets or budgets, and rather always look at what we've always articulated as our long-term goals to be.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. So 2 things that I would add because, Josh, in your question, you put in there rates moving. I would just point out that the rate movement that we just saw in interest rate has really had virtually no impact on our pricing, and to some degree, because it was a relatively small move in rates. But even the 100 basis points, at one point in time, at the 10 year got a lot of play. The duration of our liability is significantly shorter than that. So you have to look at the whole yield curve and see where rates are moving. So that has had minimal impact. And we'd need quite a bit of movement in interest rates before started changing pricing significantly. And the other...", "Jay S. Fishman", "We -- actually, Brian, just in that regard, we asked, and I do think these 2 comments are important, most of our, call it, free cash, I don't mean to define that term, but most of our free cash is used in buying back share. So if you look at our portfolio position over the last several years, it's actually been relatively flat. And most of our investing is reinvesting. And so we're not -- it's not as if we're deploying significant amounts of new cash, we've been deploying it in buying back shares. We did ask our actuaries to make an estimate of what a 100 basis point increase would be in the entire curve if there was a shift because, of course, every product is invested -- the underlying products have a duration philosophy is tied to the -- that's tied to the asset. They're not directly matched but it's very much a philosophical match. And this is just an estimate and I perhaps even would call it a guesstimate. But in terms of returns, the equivalent of 100 basis point move in the yield curve would be about 2 to 3 points in pricing rate. So 2 to 3 points in price would be equivalent in returns to 100 basis point move in the entire yield curve. Brian, am I recalling that correctly?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, that's correct.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. The other quick thing I'd point out is that weather volatility is still there. And although our second quarter cat number was dramatically less than what we have seen the last 2 years, it is dramatically higher than what 3 years ago we would have said was historical second quarter norms. So that is still out there and the marketplace needs to deal with it. So that's kind of our view.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's very helpful, Jay, Brian. Just one other question on strategy and distribution evolution. So your comments about the evolution of comparative raters, agents starting to use them for renewal business as well start to get sort of -- raise a whole bunch of questions and it's not obviously as good for the agents or -- and certainly more challenging for the company. I'm wondering if you can talk about how you think that your sort of broader sort of agency strategy evolves more if there's going to be changes in commissions or if you fundamentally try to change your position or approach to that market? And then just more broadly related to that same point, is this something that sort of starts in Auto and then moves to Home and moves the Select and ultimately as sort of a Pandora's box once it's opened?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So let me -- this is Brian. Let me start with a couple of comments, and then Jay. And I'll go to your last comment first, Josh, which is, clearly, we look at this and say it doesn't have to be just a personal auto dynamic, but complexity of product is really significant in being able to build an efficient rater technology and business process. So even Homeowners is fairly more complicated than Auto and you get into the commercial products and much more complicated than Auto. So we watch it closely but we don't think we're on the verge of comparative raters everywhere. And then I'd say the big backdrop to the question is we're not looking at a fundamental shift across the board of how we deal with independent agents. One of the great strengths of our franchise is the position that we have with agents, and we have a lot of products and we have a lot of breadth and we're going to continue to leverage that, working with them closely on what their business process is and how we continue to together bring a value proposition to the customers is important. With that said, everything is on the table where we're constantly looking it all, the dimensions of it, but we feel good about where we are with agents. Jay?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, I know, I'd -- just an observation. I think we have a well-deserved and well-earned reputation for being a low-cost-oriented company. We know from experience, I think, how to do that thoughtfully and in the best interest of the business. I think Brian's comment is right. We're determined to be successful in the business. We have an $8 billion premium combined personal lines business, and in fact, everything is on the table. But we do know how to do this. And the comparative rating technology, I get asked all the time, is the product becoming a commodity? And I'm always quick to answer, no. A commodity is a product where the only thing that doesn't matter is the price because all the prices are the same. Every -- oil, the price is the same. And that's not the case here. There are value differentiations and value perceptions and strength to agents and strength to customers, and there are differentiations. What the rater is doing, though, clearly, is increasing price competitiveness at the point-of-sale. The technology has introduced the ability of agents to see greater multiples of prices much more easily. And we do think that the onslaught of advertising over the last, and this is just an opinion, I can't prove it as a fact, but the onslaught of advertising in the space over the last 10 years has brought customers to the view that value is a more important component value dollars of the purchase than perhaps it was previously. So it's going to force a greater level of price competition and I think we're up to the task. And that's what we're going to do.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "So one question I had for, I guess, maybe for Brian first is, just looking -- I know we look at this on a year-over-year basis but sequentially, the combined -- the underlying combined in business was up a bit. And then -- and even going back and looking at 1Q to 2Q, it's not clear that the second quarter is always higher than the first. And even if we'd look at year-over-year, I mean, you're 400 basis points better in the first quarter, 300 basis points-ish better here in the second. Just trying to understand that -- was non-cat weather an element of that comparison? Or any color there on kind of the margin in Business Insurance?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Mike. I think there's always -- as Jay Benet was saying before, there's always volatility in the individual quarters. Nothing fundamental with the trend has changed over where we were with first quarter. And I know deltas have shifted a little bit. If you look at our data on Page 9, 3.1 points of underlying combined ratio better than last year and the first quarter was better than that. That was the movement in those other things. So we're going to have large losses go up or down or non-cat weather go up or down relative to the previous quarter. I think that we're still in the same place we were in the first quarter, where we think the core underlying margins here in BI are improving somewhere between 2.5 and 3 points for the business. And that is unchanged from where we were in first quarter. And everything has been, as I said before, pretty stable, both rate and loss trend there. So we don't see any fundamental shift. I know the numbers do move around a little bit.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes. And I'm just trying to understand given -- so that's great. So the 2.5 to 3 points remain so you had some noise maybe in second quarter. But is it possible to just give some parentheses around the rate-driven margin expansion that you saw in the first quarter versus the second quarter? Just because -- again, I mean, this is the first -- I mean, we've had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 consecutive quarters of sequential improvement in that underlying combined...", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, that's -- I think what I was trying to say, Mike, is the rate-driven margin improvement is the 2.5 to 3. When we try to back out the quarterly periodic volatility and what's the impact of the rate we're earning in versus the core loss trend, that continues to run at 2.5, 3 combined ratio points. And again, you have to do the arithmetic to get the -- just bring it through the combined ratio to get the math to work.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Okay, great. And then, I guess, one question on the actions in personal lines. Any thought around in this process, the direct business, and kind of cost rationalization or continued investment on that front?", "Jay S. Fishman", "The decision is certainly not being driven by the direct business, but the direct business will most certainly benefit from a lower priced product. So it will certainly help in that regard. I do want to reemphasize, so that everyone understands clearly, that the intention here is to lower cost and increase profitability. So the reduction in cost will, in effect, not be passed on entirely to the price of the product. Some of it will be retained in the form of improved profit. At least that's the plan. So it'll help. It'll certainly help the direct business.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Greg Locraft with Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to follow up on the personal lines segment. The policy counts are -- and I mean, you've admitted the policy count declines are pretty stunning and accelerating, it seems, at least this year. Homeowners back to 2006 levels, personal auto back to '04 levels, the direct initiative seems to have stalled. So you guys are losing a lot of share. You've admitted that. What I'm wondering is, is the cost plan enough? In other words, is there -- there's clearly a pricing problem in the marketplace with this segment. So is the cost plan enough such as you can cut your pricing or get more competitive to begin to stem the share losses? And then second is, what's the timing around when we'll see the tangible actions in the P&L from a PIF perspective? I'm sort of wrestling with how long to take the share losses down in my model?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. Let me start, Jay, and then throw it to you and so I'd -- several comments there. And maybe one of the things I'd say right at the front is that the actions we're taking today are somewhat -- the expense actions are somewhat a reaction to what's going on in our top line but more focused on reacting longer term to some changing dynamics in the marketplace. So it's not just a -- because the PIF is down 12%. I would look at -- so a couple of things, number one is...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Brian, can I also ask you to speak because Greg asked the question with Home, Auto, direct, and I think there is a distinction to be made there as well.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so let me start with Auto where we -- on the retail auto business through our agent channel. For starters, retentions remain pretty solid and that's been a positive. So although it's down a couple of points, it's still running at a solid level and the shortfall has been in new business. And as we've said and maybe has been obvious, that's clearly been impacted by our pricing action. We feel good that returns have improved, that the -- and 6 months are consistent with our expectations. And our price changes, independent of the expense actions, would -- will be mitigating, as you've seen in the last couple of quarters with the Auto business. So hopefully, that will bring the us back in line. The industry did post the 104.5% combined ratio last year. So it is a product that is needed rate and we feel good about the actions we take. We've taken, we think, the expense actions. And as we said before, anything else that we need to do in this business, everything is on the table, is really -- are really focused on improving that and helping us deal with the changing marketplace. So the Homeowners business, we view as fundamentally different there. We think there are some real capacity issues. That was, I think, much more of a focused weather exposure kind of actions. And so it's not just the pricing we've been driving there, which has fundamentally been driven by the losses, the weather losses, that has been come through. But it's also other actions we've taken from underwriting, deductibles, terms and conditions that have really, really driven us. So we feel very good about where our Homeowners business is right now and feel like we're in a position to move forward. The tricky part of your question is, where do we think the impacts -- well, what's the time horizon? We don't really forecast that out. We're looking at, clearly, a different PIF situation for 2014. But we'll see what that is, okay?", "Jay S. Fishman", "And just a closing comment on the direct because, Brian, I think you got both of those just right. The dynamic in direct is very much what we've been intending to do. We've been doing a test, a test of pricing sensitivity. And so our -- and people have asked you, your advertising is down. Yes, our advertising is down very intentionally because we've been focused on testing price elasticity in a very limited number of markets and gaining some insight into what that means. So I would just observe that there isn't anything in our direct channel other than also seeing and observing, of course, that pricing really matters, great shock, pricing really matters. And so again, what we're going to do in the personal space here will most -- we hope, we believe, will certainly help the direct channel as well.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess, just to follow up on this because the answer is very thorough, but what I'm wrestling with is I love that you're getting good price in the business and the retentions are holding in. So clearly, the core client base is sticking with the Travelers once in the umbrella. Direct is so small. It just seems like -- it's like an experiment, in a way, in the P&L. But really, in the agency side of Homeowners and Auto, it's the lack of the ability to attract new clients in. And I'm wondering if it's more than just the expense side. I'm wondering if it's actually you need to start to ramp advertising a lot more. You need to re-architect the product which you mentioned. I don't know if that costs money. I don't know if that's technology. In other words, I'm just -- I'm trying to wrestle with the cost to fix the new business acquisition engine in the Auto segment and...", "Jay S. Fishman", "The analytics that we have indicate, maybe even more than indicate, that pricing sensitivity for new business through comparative raters is just significantly different than it was in the past. And we have all sorts of data that shows when you're lowest in the comparative raters space, when you're second lowest and when you're third lowest. And so we know what it takes to be successful. And so I -- we don't believe that there's anything, with respect to our product, that needs to be reengineered or -- I mean, we're always filing changes. We're always filing changes in pricing. We're always filing changes in underwriting and claimants. So there's always changes going on. But we believe this is the issue in the new business front. And you're right, the renewal business has been quite stable, and that is very encouraging. So we think we're on the right path here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "I have 2 questions here for you. First, Jay, I'm just curious, the acquisition of Dominion, nice, opportunistic acquisition. But given where your stock price now is trading on a price-to-book multiple, does it change at all your thought process with respect to capital allocation? Are acquisitions here potentially more attractive than share buyback?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No, I don't believe so. This was -- there were a couple of things about the Dominion transaction that were really appealing to us. One, is it gave us some real size and scale in a market where we just were lacking badly; two, there were some scarcity value up there. There are precious few companies to be acquired. They're either mutuals or subsidiaries of larger companies or very large companies themselves. So there is a scarcity value. And it provided a first-rate management team, we think, and a terrific systems and technology and a platform to do business. So it had several compelling reasons that really just had us think about it as a special opportunity but not thinking about it differently in the context of capital management, no.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Great. And then the second question, I wonder if you could chat a little bit about the small commercial business. It seems to continue to be a little sluggish there. Is that because of the economic environment? Is it because that there's maybe more competitive down there? Why is it tending to be a little bit slower from a growth standpoint, actually declining this quarter on a written premium basis than some of the other lines?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, Brian, this is Brian MacLean. I'll start. There's several things that going on there. We've talked a while back about what was going on in the larger end, plus we talked a little bit about Auto trends that we were seeing in commercial and specifically in the Select world. So there were some targeted underwriting actions that we were taking, which we have now pretty much worked through. And it was a business, if you think of -- it's almost a great example of the segmentation concept that I was talking about in commercial accounts. If you looked across our spectrum of businesses in Business Insurance a couple of years ago, Select would've been one that, from a return perspective, we were struggling with more than others. So it would've been on the writer side of the graph of our businesses. And if you look at the pricing that we've gotten there, and in that business, RPC is really driving to the bottom line, we've gone to the point where we feel pretty good. We've worked through some underwriting actions, and that's one that we would be hopeful expecting that as the return picture has improved, we're going to be retaining more of that business going forward. So it is -- it's -- we feel good about how we've executed but we think the trajectory there should be changing in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, a couple of things. First, I guess 2 questions on pricing. The first is, the good news on pricing was, on the international side, it looks like there was an inflection point to the positive side. Can you talk about what's happening there?", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Yes, Jay, it's Alan Schnitzer. Certainly, it did pick up a little bit. I wouldn't call it an inflection point. And I'd say that the pricing dynamics outside of the United States continue to be very different than what we see in the United States. I think what you're seeing in our results, in particular, come from our efforts recently to increase our use of data and analytics and manage the portfolio and profitability. I wouldn't say there's an overall shift in the market though.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And I guess getting back to Business Insurance. You described the pricing environment over the past several years as quite stable, and clearly, that shows up in the graph. This deceleration that you've seen, modest as it is in the second quarter, investors are very sensitive to this. And I'm wondering -- I think, Brian, you had mentioned July being reasonably good. If you could give us some indication of where July stood relative to June or relative to the 2Q that would be helpful because, again, people are very sensitive to this issue. You stock is up 2.3%. Any color would definitely be helpful.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, and I think -- so I completely get it. I'll, on one hand, admit that we obsess over fractional movements in these things, but I think we and the marketplace are obsessing a little too much. And I know, we've got a better window into the detail than you do. So if you look at -- we ticked down a little bit from last quarter, literarily rounding off of 7.5%, which had ticked up a little bit from the fourth quarter. So the numbers have really been about, in the aggregate, 7.5%. Within Business Insurance, June was the strongest of the 3 months in the quarters. But again, I'm talking about fractions of a point here, of the difference between 7.2% and 7.4% in total rate. And July looks like -- right now, our look of July looks like it might be a little bit better than June. But again, I'm talking about rounding a couple of cents of a point. So I don't mean to overemphasize it. We get the sensitivity. I think we're all watching the market closely. But it's been about where it's been for a while. And then the last point I'd make is we're really actively managing the business. We're trying to make sure we're getting it in the right places and...", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes. Brian, I was actually just going to interrupt because I do think that's so important. These conversations, there's almost a backdrop as if somehow pricing is magically obtained from a third-party source from somewhere. What we're getting is what we're trying to get. I ask the question all the time, are we trying to get 12% and we're getting 7%? And the answer is no. We're managing this process very thoughtfully, always with a focus to not having disruption to agents or customers. We're in the business for the long term. We look at returns over time and will continue to march in improving returns. And as long as we're moving that way, we feel pretty good. And by the way, the retention remains as solid as it has and you can see from the more detailed graph how strong that really is.", "Jay Adam Cohen - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I guess, really, the main point based on this conversation is that the monthly data trend does not suggest any sort of slip-off, any notable slip-off? And what you're saying is the market to you does not feel like it is softening at this point despite this modest deceleration in the 2Q?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, first, it's only July 23, I think, so it's a little -- always a little reluctant to declare anything. We're only 3 quarters of the way through the month. So what we're getting is, to some extent, anecdotal with some data around it. So it's early. It's early. But if you -- on a more anecdotal basis, if you speak to people in the field, you don't get the comment back that there's any substantive change or receptiveness to our strategy. Brian, would you agree with that?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes -- no, I completely agree. And Jay, basically, I think the way you asked the question, yes, we'd agree with that, that what we've seen in our results and what we see and what were out in the marketplace quoting on, the market looks the same to us as it's been for a number of quarters now. We hear the same rhetoric but what we see and what we hear from our people is that it's continuing to move at about the same pace.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Clifford Gallant with Nomura.", "Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "There's been talk in the reinsurance marketplace that some of the new capacity that's come in has perhaps structurally changed the business, maybe made reinsurance permanently cheaper or at least more stable. I'm curious, how do you -- how will that affect your business over time and how you manage things?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, this is Jay Benet. Well, first of all, as we've said in the past, we operate the business as a gross under -- gross lines underwriter. We don't rely on reinsurance to be in a particular marketplace. And when we do have reinsurance, it's generally in the larger risk or certainly in the cat area. As it relates to our view of the market, and I'm sure there are others who have a more intense view with their utilizing the market a lot more than we are, but given our view of the market, it would seem like there's a lot of capacity that's come in on the upper level cat kind of coverages. And that's helped drive prices down. And as I mentioned, the cost that we had this July of renewing our coverages were favorable, so it costs us less. How that's going to translate or if it will translate into the working layer-type benefits to companies that rely on that, we don't have any great insight, but it would seem, to us at least, unlikely that that's going to be where this capacity would want to play. So it's not a big impact on our business for sure and we'll see what happens going forward in the marketplace. But it seems like most of this capacity would be for higher-level cat coverage where the expectation of loss -- of actual losses taking place would be very, very low.", "Operator", "This does conclude our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Nawi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good.

Welcome to the third quarter results teleconference for Travelers. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on Tuesday, October 22, 2013.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Tina. Good morning, and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our third quarter 2013 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. Other members of senior management are also available for the question-and-answer period. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will open it for questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may make mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website. And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Thank you, Gabby. Well, good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "Our financial results this quarter were really strong. We posted quarterly operating income of $883 million, a 15.2% operating return on equity and record quarterly operating income per diluted share of $2.35. Net income was $864 million, or $2.30 per diluted share, producing a 13.9% return on equity.", "In the quarter, we returned nearly $1 billion of capital to shareholders, continuing to deliver on our long-term financial goal of producing strong profitability and returning excess capital to shareholders.", "While the current quarter certainly benefited from low weather-related losses, most importantly our underlying underwriting profitability continued to improve across our businesses, largely the result of the successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we have been pursuing over the last several years.", "While we are really pleased with our financial results not just in the current quarter or year-to-date but over now more than 5 years, we continue to expect to be confronted with more volatile weather patterns and historically low interest rates. As it relates to weather, notwithstanding the fact that in this quarter we had very low catastrophe losses, on a year-to-date basis, our pre-tax cat losses now stand at nearly $540 million. To put that in perspective, that number, again a 9-month figure with a fairly benign third quarter, approaches the $600 million of catastrophe losses that we provided at the end of 2009 in connection with our full year 2010 guidance.", "It is worth noting that over that period of time, we believe that our catastrophe exposure has not changed meaningfully, but losses have risen as a result of increased frequency and severity of weather events.", "An interesting way of observing this phenomena is through the data on Slide 4 of our webcast where we have displayed the number of extreme weather events with economic losses over $1 billion by year over the last 30-plus years. While this data does adjust losses for inflation, it does not take into account exposure growth over time. Nonetheless, it is hard not to take notice of the trend. We, of course, evaluate weather over the long term and continue to believe that more recent weather patterns are different and cause us to anticipate higher levels of frequency and severity of weather-related losses.", "As to fixed-income yields, we continue to believe that interest rates will remain at historically low levels, at least until 2016. Although the long end of the yield curve has moved somewhat, it is not yet enough to make a difference in the return profile of our business in any significant way. Total yields remain just off historical lows.", "Consequently, in our commercial lines businesses, we will continue to pursue improved profitability and product returns by seeking higher rates on an account by account basis so as to continue to minimize disruption to our agents and customers. So far, this strategy has worked exceptionally well, and we expect that at least for some time across our portfolio, we will be able to continue to achieve written rate gains in excess of estimated loss trend.", "In Personal Insurance, we're excited about the launch of our new product, Quantum 2.0, during the fourth quarter of this year. We are hopeful that this lower cost, lower-priced Auto insurance product will allow us to improve volumes at attractive returns. We will know more as we get into 2014.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay S. Benet", "Thank you, Jay. Let me begin by saying that our third quarter results, operating income of $2.35 per diluted share, a record level, and operating ROE of 15.2%, were very strong, having benefited from solid investment and underwriting performance.", "Our combined ratio of 88.9% was also very strong, reflecting earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments, a relatively low level of both cat and non-cat weather-related losses and $158 million of net favorable prior year reserve development, which was net of an increase to our asbestos reserves. As has been the case in recent periods while the underlying asbestos environment has remained essentially unchanged, payment trends have been moderately higher than what we had expected. For the quarter, excluding the asbestos provision, which, in a 10-year table, would be included in the prior to 2004 accident year row, each accident year developed favorably, and each product line developed favorably or was essentially unchanged.", "We continue to generate capital in excess of what is needed to support our businesses, and, consistent with our strategy, we have returned a very significant amount of capital to our shareholders.", "Operating cash flows in excess of $1.6 billion were extremely strong this quarter, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $2.9 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of approximately $1.9 billion after returning almost $1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $185 million and common share repurchases of $800 million. Year-to-date, we returned almost $2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $552 million and common share repurchases of $1.4 billion, leaving us with only $759 million remaining under previous share repurchase authorizations as of the end of the third quarter. Since we may exhaust this amount before the end of the year, as announced today our Board of Directors authorized an additional $5 billion of share repurchases.", "All of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total cap ratio of 21.4% was well within its target range, although up slightly in the quarter due to our successfully issuing $500 million of 30-year, 4.6% senior debt at the end of July. Book value per share increased 2%, and adjusted book value per share, which excludes unrealized investment gains and losses, increased 3% during the quarter. While year-to-date, book value per share increased 1%, and adjusted book value per share increased 8%.", "The difference between the unadjusted and adjusted year-to-date growth rates in book value per share was driven by the impact that the recent rise in interest rates had on net unrealized investment gains. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $3.1 billion at the beginning of the year.", "So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian, who's going to comment further on operating results.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. In Business Insurance, we had a great quarter with operating income of $526 million and a combined ratio of 93%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year development, improved by about 1 point year-over-year and reflected about 2.5 points of margin expansion due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.", "When comparing the combined ratios quarter-over-quarter, any one quarter can be lumpy. This quarter, the comparison was negatively impacted by an unusually low level of non-cat, weather-related losses in the third quarter 1 year ago and, to a lesser extent, a couple of non-run rate adjustments that helped last year's combined ratio. On a year-to-date basis, the underlying combined ratio improved nearly 3 points due primarily to the earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends, and this is a better indicator of how the business is performing.", "Looking at the production results for the segment on Page 10, retention and renewal premium change remained strong and in line with recent periods at 80% and 9%, respectively, while new business volume was up slightly versus the prior year. The renewal premium change was driven by pure rate increases of 7.1% and exposure and other of about 2%. Rate increases continued to be broad based and range from 6% to 10% across all lines, led by Commercial Auto and Worker's Compensation. So in the aggregate, the production metrics in the quarter were very stable across the segment, and we continue to be pleased with this result. But as we've emphasized in the past, the detail behind how we got to the aggregate result is what's really important, and we remain very pleased with our granular execution as well.", "The segmented rate and retention results remain largely consistent with what we've discussed in prior quarters. For our best-performing business, retention remained very high with written rate gains exceeding loss trend, while we continue to get significant rate increases on our poor-performing accounts.", "So overall, a great story in the segment. We saw meaningful underlying underwriting margin expansion due to earned rate gains that continued to significantly exceed the loss trend, which remained consistent at approximately 4%. Going forward, we will continue to execute on our strategy of improving returns by maximizing the rate and retention trade-off at a very granular level.", "In Financial, Professional & International Insurance, operating income of $160 million was very strong, though down 11% from last year. The prior year quarter benefited from a particularly low level of large losses, which, along with year-over-year lower net favorable prior year reserve development, drove the decrease. Similarly, the underlying combined ratio of 92.5% deteriorated by 1.1 points due to the higher level of large losses in the third quarter of 2013, largely offset by earned rate that exceeded loss cost trend in both our bond and financial products and international businesses.", "Written premiums in this segment were up 6% compared to the prior year quarter, driven by continued favorable rate in Management Liability, strong construction surety results and higher new business in International.", "In Personal Insurance, operating income of $262 million was up 27% versus the third quarter of 2012, while the underlying combined ratio for the quarter improved nearly 6 points year-over-year, driven by lower weather-related losses along with nearly 2 points attributable to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trends.", "Looking specifically at Auto production, retention of 81% kicked up from recent periods, renewal premium change was over 7%, while new business volumes and net written premiums were down year-over-year.", "Turning to Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 97.6% was an improvement of 0.5 point versus the prior year quarter. The underlying loss ratio improved about 1.5 points, primarily reflecting earned rates that exceeded loss cost trend, while the expense ratio was up about 1 point due to some unusual items, including a charge related to the expense action we discussed last quarter. Excluding the impact of these items, the expense ratio would have been about flat quarter-over-quarter.", "Auto loss cost trends remain stable at about 5% overall, mix-adjusted frequency continue to be benign, while severity trend remain stable at a slightly elevated level. Specifically, bodily injury severity trend this quarter remained in line with what we've seen over the past few quarters.", "I'd like to take a moment to talk about Quantum 2.0, our new Auto product which we began rolling out this week and will be rolling out in approximately 15 states during the fourth quarter. Our goal is to offer a lower cost, highly sophisticated and segmented auto product that successfully competes in the marketplace and generates an appropriate return. Quantum 2.0 helps us to achieve that goal by leveraging 8 years of data and experience from Quantum 1.0 to create a more granular and highly segmented product. It will also benefit from a significantly lower cost structure, thanks to both the expense reduction that we announced last quarter, along with a base commission rate that is approximately 2 points slower than Quantum 1.0.", "When fully realized, the combined impact of these savings will be about a 12% reduction in the non-loss cost base for the product. So a significant impact.", "We're very excited about this product. We believe that Quantum 2.0 will allow us to improve our competitive position, drive increased business volumes and deliver improved returns.", "Turning to Homeowners, pricing was also very strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of 11%, retention stable at 83% and new business volume that was up slightly from the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio for Home was 71.6% in the quarter, an improvement of over 7 points year-over-year. The primary driver of the improvement was lower non-cat, weather-related losses, but we also saw over 1 point of improvement due to earned rate increases that exceeded loss cost trend. So a very strong underwriting result for the segmented in the quarter as we continue to see the positive impact of the underwriting and pricing actions we've taken.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Tina, we're ready for the question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Tina?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "I wanted just to go to Page 10. And given that there's so much kind of focus on the red line there, the renewal rate change, I wanted to understand why the previous historical numbers in that chart can kind of adjust down a little bit each time we see this presentation. What drives kind of a revision to those prior quarter numbers each time you update this illustration?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Right, Randy, this is Jay Fishman. I'll start, and then I'll have Brian chime in as well. First, to your -- we enter into a month's production period. Policies renew, policies don't renew. But it doesn't end as of the reporting date. There can be transactions, cancellations, endorsements, changes in pricing even that occur after the reporting date. So we're always going back and making not adjustments but truing up the reported numbers to what the most recent data actually is. Now I'd make a point that the rate change, the rate change actually is far less than the exposure change will be in a given period. Exposure has audit adjustments embedded in it and, as a consequence, as those are reflected, they will have more change. The rate change, if you look back, has actually been relatively modest and generally is a result of cancellations, early cancellations midterms or other endorsements. But I'll ask Brian to chime in a little, too.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. And one of the things I'll just emphasize is that at the top of the page, it says, \"Illustrative Business Statistics.\" So this isn't an accounting number that's getting booked into the financials. This is us looking at our written production results. And it's -- but it's exactly what Jay just said. When we close the books at a given period of time, we try to make our best assessment of what the production is going to be, but there's also always movement in the accounts. And the adjustments tend to be fairly consistent, but they move around. I don't know, Bill, any -- yes.", "Randy Binner - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division", "Just one quick follow-up. And I appreciate that you think that the market's focus on this is too myopic, but I guess relative to the number of 7.2% that you gave at Barclays versus 7.1% now. Is it more just kind of the chatter of those adjustments that Jay mentioned? Or was there actually kind of a lower rate in that last month for the quarter?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, the Barclays number was a 2-month number. At least it was as of whatever date that conference was. This is obviously the full quarter. What I don't know is, if we had updated those 2-month numbers, whether they would have reflected any change for midterm cancellations or endorsements. So I honestly don't know, and I agree with your assessment that you're looking at it too myopically. I don't know the answer.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "In the Business Insurance segment, the underlying loss ratio, not the combined ratio, it looks to have incrementally deteriorated year-over-year. I would have thought it would have improved given pricing continued to trend in the high single digits. I know high or non-cat weather losses were cited. So is that the main culprit? Or are loss cost inflation rates creeping higher as well?", "Brian W. MacLean", "So this is Brian and then I'll let Jay Benet comment. But no, loss cost trends are not creeping. They've remained really flat at right around 4%. Obviously, little pieces move up and down, but the overall loss trend has been very, very consistent. The biggest driver in there is the non-cat weather. Jay, I don't know if you want to go through more of the detail, but that's the biggest change that flows through that.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes. No, I would add only a little bit to what Brian said. I mean, if you're looking at quarter-to-quarter comparisons, you're always going to see some variances associated with things like non-cat weather impacting the data, which is why in Brian's comments he really provides the information as to what underlying is -- underlying the underlying loss ratio is taking place with regard to the margin expansion relative to earned pricing versus loss trend.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then lastly, could you update us on the gap between the new money yields and the existing portfolio yield? And I ask because the fixed-income portfolio yield has actually been steady for 3 sequential quarters now.", "William H. Heyman", "Well, the gap is -- there still is a gap between new money yields and...", "Jay S. Fishman", "By the way, this is Bill Heyman speaking.", "William H. Heyman", "Oh, hi. Sorry, yes. And yields on securities which are maturing. It's closing. It depends on which asset class you're looking at, corporates and municipals. But in -- let's take long-term municipals. The raw yield, which is an after-tax yield, of new money is still probably 0.4% lower than what is maturing.", "Michael Zaremski - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, so the fixed-income portfolio stayed steady, though, in recent quarters. Is that just due to some nuances in the portfolio?", "William H. Heyman", "I think the -- I mean, we analyze the change in the book yield of the portfolio to the basis point every quarter, and the change in the first 9 months of this year was 11 basis points. Now in terms of the raw returns from the portfolio, that doesn't really amount to much.", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, and this is Jay Benet. Just -- let me just add a couple of points. If you look in our -- in the Outlook section of the 10-Q, we are projecting about a $25 million-per-quarter drag on earnings associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio -- pieces of the portfolio that are maturing at the lower rates. And I think part of what you're seeing or not seeing is the impact of just rounding to the nearest tenth as opposed to going out further when you look at those yields.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "For the $5 billion share repurchase authorization, if I think about for 2013, the company is essentially running at an annualized retained earnings less shareholder dividend pace of around $2.5 billion annually. So based on that, should we assume that, that buyback could take place of around 2 years?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, we've been saying for the last several years, Jay, now that return of capital is ultimately going to be tied to earnings. And so it really is a question of weather and catastrophe losses and all of the various elements. You pick the earnings -- and by the way, Jay always reminds me that we always need to take into account dollars to make pension contributions if necessary or to pay off maturing obligations that we might want to -- might not want to refinance...", "Jay S. Benet", "Essentially to support the growth of the business.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Support the growth of the business. So there's always an additional call. But you figure the earnings, divide that into 5, whatever the number is, it's probably not an unreasonable assumption. Include dividends when you do that, by the way.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay. And then that $5 billion authorization, given the magnitude of that potential buyback, it appears that signals a strong degree of confidence in your overall reserve position?", "Jay S. Benet", "Our reserve position is always our best estimate of what our reserves should be, and I think you can see how the reserves have been playing out over the last many years.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right, okay. And then any thoughts you'd like to provide on the proposed accounting changes from FASB on GAAP for insurance companies given that they could be substantial in terms of the -- and also somewhat adverse relative to how insurers present their financial positions?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We'll always do what regulators ask us to do. And however we're asked to report, we'll report. We don't have a view. We follow directions.", "Jay S. Benet", "Okay, and if I can add a couple of things to that. Certainly, we are always very compliant. This is a draft that's been issued. And like other companies, we are responding to the draft, talking to the FASB about what we think is good about it and suggesting areas to be improved.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just one question in BI. It looks like property grew the most this quarter. It hasn't happened for a while in terms of year-over-year premium growth. Just trying to understand. Given that, that doesn't appear where pricing is best, is that a deliberate area of growth for you? Are you seeing exposure growth? Or is that just -- or is that new business? Just a little context on that would be great.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. So this is Brian. So if you really get underneath what's driving the growth in premium, it's very strong retention and it's pricing. So we're not growing our risk count there anything dramatically. And in fact, our overall pricing in the property line, our results throughout this year have been strong and actually a little bit ahead of what the total BI average is. So retention is very strong, pricing has been solid and we feel good about it, so.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then I guess the year-over-year has been a bit of a focus in BI in terms of the margin. You cited non-cat weather there being a contributor. It sounds like it went the other way in Homeowners. But I guess the question is, is the fourth quarter -- what's the setup for the fourth quarter? Just given that the sequential -- the comp averages improved sequentially in fourth quarter versus third quarter last year. Is it going to be tough comps again because of non-cat weather in 4Q?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, let me go back and just clarify the non-cat weather story across the place. So it was, from a meteorological perspective, a light weather quarter. That came through very clearly in Personal lines. In Business Insurance last year, we had an adjustment that we put through in the third quarter to our current year prior quarter property loss pick last year in the third quarter, and it was a light weather quarter in BI. Remembering that Business Insurance is always going to have a little more volatility to the actual losses you could get from an event, you can have large exposures in one year. You have an event, you don't get hit. In the next year, you have one. So that's just to clarify what sounds like a difference in weather patterns between our segments. The bigger story last -- was -- in BI was the last year number was so low. The fourth quarter, I think, we're -- I don't know, Jay. We -- we're not going to get into projecting what we see. Through -- broadly speaking, the thing I would emphasize is the year-to-date, we continue to see something like 2.5, 3 points of margin expansion running through the underlying combined ratio and expect that for the full year, we're going to be somewhere around 2.5 points of margin expansion. So that's, I think, the -- what we're still looking for. And then the results in the quarter will be what they are.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Particularly, weather.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. that's right.", "Operator", "And our next version comes from Greg Locraft of Morgan Stanley.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to just follow up on the Quantum 2.0 initiative. You mentioned it's being rolled out in the fourth quarter in 15 states. Can you talk about the average price decline? I mean -- or have you filed yet? And can you talk about how that's going to impact pricing in those 15 states?", "Gregory C. Toczydlowski", "Sure, Greg. This is Greg Toczydlowski. We look at Quantum on a state-by-state rollout basis. Brian referenced some of the expense reductions across the non-loss component of the business at the minus 12. If you think of that across the country, that's somewhere in the minus 10 to minus 13 range from a pricing perspective or the lower price of Quantum 2.0. Of course, that will vary at a very local territory level. But in aggregate, that's a good sense for you to understand what the pricing disparity will be.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes. And specifically, you asked have we filed. We're in the process of doing that. So as we roll out states, obviously -- obviously we've filed in a lot of places. And as we get the approvals, we're rolling out. And our plan is that by the end of June, by the end of the second quarter next year, we will essentially be fully rolled out, which means that there will always be those few states where we have a kind of a unique regulatory environment and work with a different product.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay, that's very clear. So just to come back, so the average price decline for this product versus before is 10% -- so this is 10% cheaper to your clients then than what they were getting before, is it? Nationwide by June, that's what you're going to have on the shelf?", "Gregory C. Toczydlowski", "That's correct, Greg. And again, that's a generalization. All states have variations, but that's kind of the high-level math.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And Greg, I'd make just 2 points. First, that is literally across the entire book. So you will find we have prices -- we showed you a graph previously, we have prices in 2.0 that are higher than 1.0, and we have prices in 2.0 that are considerably down more than 10%. I would draw your attention back to last quarter, the webcast where we gave you that...", "Gabriella Nawi", "The chart.", "Jay S. Fishman", "That spot diagram...", "Gabriella Nawi", "Yes.", "Jay S. Fishman", "That we have out there...", "Brian W. MacLean", "The Barclays presentation.", "Jay S. Fishman", "The Barclays presentation. But that's -- so it's important to remember that it's a big divergence. It's not 10% for every account. Plus, we really don't know how quickly the renewal book will move over to -- so this is -- it's new only, but at -- available to agents for renewal business where they opt for it. We just don't know yet how quickly that renewal book will roll over either, so we're in a wait-and-see pattern there as well.", "Gregory Locraft - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Understood, understood. And what are you doing on the Homeowners side? Will Quantum pick up Homeowners business at all? Does it focus on Homeowners? Or what will you be doing there?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, the Quantum product is purely an Auto product. The majority of our business is account business, though, however. So we believe we will absolutely see a lift in the Homeowners production side as we roll out a more competitive Auto product.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And I'd make the observation that the decline in policies in force in the Homeowners book is meaningfully tilted towards catastrophe-focused areas where losses have been more challenging in the context of a changing weather environment. It's being driven by higher deductibles, higher pricing, but it's not -- meaning it's not uniquely a pricing issue in Homeowners. It's also a catastrophe management dynamic that sits around it. We were hopeful that it wouldn't have had as much decline as it has had, but it is what it is and we're going to price for catastrophes appropriately and manage our book accordingly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "So just to follow up on the last question on Quantum 2.0. If the pricing changes approximately 10%, how should we think about sort of a commensurate impact on margins?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so this is Brian again, and [indiscernible]. But we are targeting the same returns on this product that we do in our overall business. So as we look at the expense actions we're taking and the underwriting and risk selection that we're refining on the product side, we -- that'll be partly driven back to the consumer in lower prices and partly driven to ensuring appropriate margins. We're looking at both -- accomplishing both objectives. But the fundamental target returns on the business have not changed.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "And what...", "Jay S. Fishman", "We may experience -- it's entirely possible that we may experience in the early days of Quantum 2.0 a return that is lower. There is -- I don't like the term because it's often confused. There is a new business penalty. It's not a premium penalty. We don't charge less for the product new than renewal, but there is a loss dynamic that takes some time to sort out in the underwriting profile. So it's very possible in the early days that the returns may not be at the level that we'd like them to be. We fully anticipate that, and we'll manage the book accordingly as we make adjustments. But Brian's point about not -- about having it priced to be the same return over time is exactly right.", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's helpful. The only other question I have is, I guess, going back to Slide 10. Has the source of new business changed? I guess what would be helpful is, is it coming from issues at your competitors? Is it a function of the economy? Or is it new niches?", "Gabriella Nawi", "Yes.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Sorry, Amit. Just to clarify it, when you're saying Slide 10, are you asking about the new business dollar amounts? Are you asking about... .", "Amit Kumar - Macquarie Research", "Yes, the source of the new business on Slide 10. Has it changed over the past few quarters? Or has the mix changed? I guess that's what I'm asking.", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, I would say the short answer to that is no. There hasn't been any fundamental shifts in where we're getting our new business from and lines of business and industries, et cetera, so.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Over a longer period of time, there has been some shift in lines. But in the context of the last several quarters, no.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Evercore.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "The first question is on the Quantum 2.0 product. I believe you're rolling it out this quarter. What are the indications right now you are getting from the agents on the new business side from that product?", "Jay S. Fishman", "We don't -- it's just -- it -- we don't have any yet, really. It's just too early.", "Brian W. MacLean", "I mean, literally, we just started rolling out this past weekend.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, in 2 states.", "Brian W. MacLean", "So we're out, like, 3 days. And so it's a handful of states so far. And like we said, it'll be 15 or so by the end of the quarter. We will, in the next coming weeks, begin to get a better answer to that.", "Vinay Misquith - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. The second question was on the Select Accounts in that -- on Slide 11. The new business dropped off a little bit there. Just curious about the pushback you're getting from your clients because it seems that we might be running into headwinds in terms of the amount of rate increases you can get on that business. So I'm just curious about your strategy in this line.", "Brian W. MacLean", "And so Select Accounts -- and I think we've mentioned this on previous calls or at least, I think, the last call actually. Select was an area -- first of all, we think of that business as the Express world of the really small accounts and then Plus, Express being a little bit more than half of our portfolio. And that's an area where, going back a couple of years ago, we felt the returns in that business were very challenged. We were fairly aggressive in what we were doing from a pricing perspective. We feel better about the returns in the Express world now, and that is one where we are starting to shift our strategy to wanting to, first and foremost, retain more of that book. And then we'll see where the new business appetite goes. But...", "Jay S. Fishman", "I'd make just 2 other observations. First, retention in the line has been absolutely consistent. So there's -- notwithstanding renewal rate change, that's been in those -- in that high 6 area. Retention has been absolutely solid. And the difference between $97 million of new business and $89 million in the third quarter of this year versus third quarter of last, those are pretty small numbers. I -- there isn't anything that we've seen that would suggest any fundamental shift any real change going on in Select relative to the pricing environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On personal auto, the nonrenewals compared -- or at least the -- policy counts down 12% from 1 year ago, and you have 9% to 10% rate increases. I would think the margin improvement would be better that you're weeding out the unprofitable drivers, getting great increases on the newer drivers. When do we have to wait for this to come through?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Josh, this is Brian. The first thing I would say is we've talked a good bit over the last probably 1.5 years to 2 years now about loss trend in personal auto and the -- particularly the bodily injury severity side. And that has been running at an elevated level, the aggregate 5% loss trend we've talked about for the last couple of quarters. So as we've earned in the rate increase, the margin expansion hasn't been quite as dramatic as it has in other businesses. So that would be the first point I'd make. The other, on the overall growth, the retention has remained pretty solid and has actually picked up a little bit the last quarter. And the real strategy here is the new product and having a more competitive product in the marketplace and, as Greg went through, the biggest lever in that is what we've done on the expense side. Historically, our loss ratio performance in this business is top quartile, the expense ratio, and that's all in with commission has been the challenge. And so we think the new product will deal with that pretty effectively.", "Joshua D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "So when I think about the new product and the legacy drivers on the older iterations. Where should we see expense ratio 1 year from today? Will it be higher or will it be lower than it is right now?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Well, expense ratio, we're -- we fully expect will be lower. So the expense actions that we took, the $140 million that we're taking out of our operations, is not product specific. That's coming out of the business. About $100 million of that $140 million, I think, was Auto, and some of it is in the personal lines franchise, so it will affect the other products as well.", "Jay S. Fishman", "I guess I'd look at 2 other things. First, even 1 year from now, the percentage that Quantum 2.0 makes up of our total book is still going to be a relatively small percentage. And so relative to the commission component, there will still be a meaningful portion of Quantum 1.0 that will still be on the books. I don't know if the expense ratio will be lower. I don't know what's going to happen to premiums. I don't know how effective the product is in restoring new business. We know what we've done in terms of expenses. That we've done, and we can be very clear and very certain about that. What happens in the marketplace and what percentage Quantum 2.0 makes of the whole book, that's yet to be determined.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields of Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I'm going to ask this maybe in a more specific way that it can be answered, but if you had the Quantum 2.0 rate decreases in effect now, do you have any sense as to what the year-over-year PIF change would have been?", "Jay S. Fishman", "No. I can tell you what we did in looking at its pricing structure was to do a fair amount of back testing. And we went back with the product, and we went back with the pricing and we went back with the sales to determine at least to be able to have a perspective on competitive profile. Now we feel pretty good about that. The back testing results were encouraging. But that doesn't take into account competitive reaction or what other companies will do or not do. So we don't know. I can tell you that the back testing caused us to be encouraged, but we only control what we control. And so I -- we don't know what the PIF would be if we had rolled it out.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, I completely understand. In the 10-Q, you talk about favorable development, even on very recent years, for general liability because, in part, of the judicial environment. Can you talk a little bit about how you can tell, in the near term, whether that's actual benign emergence as opposed to just timing issue?", "Jay S. Benet", "Yes, this is Jay Benet. When you look at longer-tail lines, you're looking at what's taking place in the current environment. But when we think about the current environment, that's not a snapshot of the last 3 months. That's a snapshot of a longer period of time. So if you see some favorable development in a long-tail line that's taking place and -- relative to recent years, what we're really talking about is going back a few years, looking at the favorable judicial environment, in this particular case that you're asking about, and then saying, okay, now that we know that from the past, what does that mean rolling forward into the loss picks that we had for the more current period? So it's not a look at, okay, what was the expectation for loss in the 2012 accident year, what are the losses there. It's a more fulsome look over periods that preceded that as to what does that mean for our loss pick for 2012. I hope that answers your question.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, it does.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cliff Gallant of Nomura.", "Clifford H. Gallant - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division", "I had another question on Quantum 2.0. You said that you were cutting your commissions, I believe, 2 points. I'm just curious, how does the agent take that? Are they excited about the reduced price? So they get volume? And also, I'm curious, when you think about your total relationship with your agents, how important is that 2-point cut on just that -- on just the Auto product?", "Brian W. MacLean", "Yes, so obviously, it's a question we've thought about a lot. I'd start with, I think broadly, we. And by we, I mean the industry here. We don't give our agents enough credit and that, first and foremost, they fully appreciate the need to have a competitive product in the marketplace. And they are very aware of what's gone on in the private passenger consumer auto business, and they know they need more competitive alternatives. I'd also emphasize that we really built this product with lots of agent input. And hopefully, we've also been able to demonstrate to the agents that we are really committed to the independent agent channel. And this really gets to your last point of when agents look at us and what we do across the spectrum of our businesses. I think they appreciate that we are at the forefront of underwriters that are working aggressively to make that channel successful. So I think all of those things are very positive. With that said, every agent, all things being equal, would rather have higher commission than lower commission. But we feel really good about the dialogue we've had with them and the engagement, and we will see what the results are as they roll out.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And I'd make the observation that the comparative rating process, it's obvious to us, and we've shared that data with you, is trumping everything, that competitive price at the point of sale from a well-respected company and a quality brand name matters a lot more than whether commission is 1 point or 2 higher or 1 point or 2 lower. There are lower-paying commission companies that have grown value, grown volumes significantly, and there are higher paying that have not. It's not -- it's a factor, but at least, as we assess the marketplace, it certainly isn't the most meaningful factor.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO.", "Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Following up on the Quantum 2.0 and the direct market channel. Given this level of an expense cut, is it too -- is this product going to be available in the direct-to-consumer? And do you expect that to grow that channel?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, and we sure hope so.", "Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay.", "Jay S. Fishman", "It's certainly -- we -- one of the things that we -- and we've talked about this in the last couple of calls. We've been doing price testing in a couple of states, trying to determine elasticity of demand in a more granular way. And it became apparent to us that we needed a lower-priced product not only to be more successful in a comparative rating agent-driven world but also in the direct-to-consumer world. This will make a meaningful difference. I don't know what happens from the competitive reaction, but this will make a difference in the attractiveness of the product in the direct channel.", "Charles J. Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets U.S.", "Okay. The -- a question on pricing and the competitive marketplace on Management Liability. There seems to be increased focus from some of your competitors. I'm just wondering if you have any color on what you see going on there with pricing and just competition in general.", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "Sure. It's Alan Schnitzer. There's always competition in these markets. And you really can't look at this as one broad Management Liability market. There are different geographies, there are different products, there are different lines, different segments, and each of them has their own dynamics. So as we've been approaching the market, we price as granularly here, as we do in the other lines that we talk a lot about, seeking to get rate on those lines and those accounts where we need it. And we've been successful doing that, and you see the RPC in the quarter having been the result of that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "So I wanted to continue with some comment -- questions around Quantum. And one of the -- I think in one of your presentations, you guys provided a scatter plot, a sort of new versus old price. I'm wondering if you could talk to us generically about the sort of the lift charts you've done where you compare loss ratios for -- against the price changes you're taking, much like the, I think, the slides you guys used a bunch of times now with your commercial lines of business as people how think -- people think about personal, a lot of changes. And I'm trying to just get a better sense of whether Quantum 2.0 is a big deal from the pricing segmentation perspective or whether it's really more about sort of the repackaging, the cost cutting and lower commissions into just a new business offering that you can use to drive volume.", "Gregory C. Toczydlowski", "This is Gregory Toczydlowski again. Anytime we bring a new product out, we constantly learn from the prior one. We take that experience, and we get a little more sophisticated and a little more segmented. So Quantum 2.0 will clearly have additional segmentation in addition to some product features that you talked about. But really, when we look at those scattergrams, that really is our understanding of what loss experience is in the marketplace of our quote business and our in-force business. And then we bring the new product out, where there will be, as Jay said, ups and downs across various customers, but it is because of that new segmentation.", "Jay S. Fishman", "And at the Barclays conference, we actually gave a couple of examples of specific underwriting changes that were incorporated into 2.0 as a result of what we had learned in 1.0, areas in which we had been too stringent, where we had set an underwriting standard that not only wasn't competitive but even when we sold the product turned out not to make a difference in the loss performance. So there's some of that as well in this. It's not just a lower price cranked into a new product.", "Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division", "That's helpful. A broader question I'd love to ask is you guys very helpfully gave us guidance on pricing, if I can call it that, sort of your outlook in the Q, which I think I interpret -- can interpret as saying that you're going to continue -- you're going to do what you're going to do. And, I mean, the market will do what it does, but that you're going to continue to raise price for the next -- through the end of the year and well into '14. You guys actually have to plan the business many months ahead, rate revisions, product filings. You're probably doing an annual budgeting process right now. What guidance are you actually giving your staff? And what are you actually planning for in 2014?", "Jay S. Fishman", "Well, first, I'd disagree that we give guidance. We're giving you our outlook. We're required to give one. We do the best we can. We always say that we're going to attempt to do what we're going to attempt to do. We don't know what anyone else will do and, therefore, I don't know whether it'll succeed in the marketplace. We've said that over and over. And also, in the 10-Q, we really speak to renewal premium change in the aggregate, not just rate, but we talk about renewal premium change. What -- our instructions to the field organization in Business Insurance are no different today than they were 1 month ago or 2 months ago or 3 months ago. It's account by account; it's drive business from the right side of the segmentation to the left, meaning from the poor-performing categories to the best-performing categories; as we move left, focus more on retention and less on rate, although it's great if we can get rate in excess of loss trend even in our best-performing business; and at the right side if, and we've shown you this information before, if retention is comparatively low, that's just fine. You're talking about components of the business that are not building value but taking value. And our instructions to them are no different. We don't give them a target. Our experience has been, over a long period of time, that if you give a field force a target, you will get it, but you will not get it in a way that's designed to actually produce improved profitability. You'll get the rate that you asked for on the poorest accounts. You will lose the accounts that are best performing in the minimum rate thresholds. So we give them analytical data. We give them lots of information. And we are very return driven. They try and improve the returns on the accounts, and then we leave it to the underwriters to execute. And that is the way we run the business.", "Gabriella Nawi", "And this will be the last question, please. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a couple of quick ones here. First, you mentioned in the Q that the G&A expenses in the Business Insurance benefited from reduced assessments. I wonder if you can just quantify that for us?", "Jay S. Benet", "Hold on a minute.", "Brian W. MacLean", "It's not a number we have off the top of our heads. You want to go to your next one while we look for that one?", "Brian Meredith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Sure. Yes. I guess the second one, I'm curious, when you closed the Dominion acquisition, do you plan on implementing the kind of Quantum 2.0-type pricing there as well? And in addition to that, what about -- with respect to kind of commission rates and stuff. Are you going to apply that to the Dominion personal auto book? Because I know they got a pretty big Ontario auto book. And how that's going to be impacted by the 15% rate reduction that Ontario is taking?", "Alan D. Schnitzer", "It's Alan Schnitzer. We will certainly be applying all of our knowhow in technology and thought process from our U.S. experience into Canada. Whether that exact product, with those specific characteristics, translates or not will be a question for us, but we will certainly have all of our resources and knowhow martialed to bring to bear to that product.", "Jay S. Fishman", "Yes, the commission, the TL&F variance, that you're looking at is about 12 pretax. So it's relatively modest. But when you look at a quarter-over-quarter comparison, it does come into play.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay, that concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining us. And as always, Andrew Hersom and myself are available for any additional follow-up questions. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 22, 2014.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our first quarter 2014 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.

Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "Now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased to report an outstanding start to 2014 with net and operating income of over a billion dollars and record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95. Our operating return on equity of nearly 18% in the quarter is the highest since the fourth quarter of 2009 when we posted just over 18%. These results keep us very much on track to meet our financial objective of achieving a mid-teens return on equity over time, and this is the case even if one were to exclude our favorable prior year reserve development in the quarter given that our accident year operating return on equity was 14.7%.", "In the fourth quarter of last year, I shared with you that we believe we were firing on all cylinders, and that continues today. We had terrific first quarter results in business insurance where profitability improved once again. We couldn\u2019t be more pleased with our efforts to improve returns through the continued execution of our granular pricing strategy. Given our segmentation approach of seeking appropriate returns on an account-by-account and class-by-class basis, we have shared with you that the headline aggregate rate gain which is the result of our active pricing strategy will come down as we continue to execute this strategy. Some industry observers perceive this as an indication of increasing price competitiveness. We reject that notion because we are managing our pricing actions very thoughtfully and in that regard for our individually underwritten accounts we have the ability to consider each individual account\u2019s contribution before engaging in renewal negotiations. This is where analytical competitive advantage based on data really matters. ", "Our strategy is very much proactive and much less reactive than it seems many industry observers believe. That said, our assessment of the competitive environment as it relates to rate is that it is for the most part unchanged. This is supported by the fact that we continued to achieve historically high levels of account retention. Another point of support is the data we are providing on Slide 4 of the webcast which for our middle market business compares the renewal rate gain and number of accounts in the poorest performing segment of this business in the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2013. You can see that the renewal rate gain was virtually the same in these quarters but that the number of accounts qualifying as poorest performing and renewed in the quarter declined from 289 to 216. As our overall portfolio improves and the number of accounts in our poorest performance band has declined, the change in the aggregate headline rate gain to the extent that this band contributes to that headline number reflects the decline in accounts in this band rather than a change in the competitive environment within the band. In summary, given that our goal is to achieve improved returns consistent with our financial objectives, there\u2019s nothing that we see happening in the competitive environment today that causes us to be less optimistic about our ability to achieve our goal. ", "In financial, professional and international insurance, we achieved 20% growth in operating income and a 47% increase in net written premiums, both from the impact of the Dominion acquisition and strong performance in our management liability and surety businesses. Our integration efforts in Canada are very much on track and we are really pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made.", "Turning to personal insurance, in homeowners we produced a combined ratio of 72.4% or 86.5% excluding favorable prior year development, even considering the meaningful winter weather we experienced in the quarter. This performance, taken in the context of our results over the last decade, continues to demonstrate industry-leading performance. In personal auto, we experienced 1.1 points of improvement in the underlying combined ratio. More importantly, we are very excited about the deployment of our new personal auto product, Quantum Auto 2.0. We\u2019ve now rolled the product out in 28 states and the District of Columbia. It was our expectation that this product would dramatically improve our comparative rate or quoting position, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re experiencing so far.", "While we\u2019ve achieved this improvement largely through reductions in price, it is critical to note that this lower price structure is based upon the expense actions we have committed to and meaningfully achieved, as well as a lower commission for Quantum Auto 2.0. Consequently, once fully rolled out, we believe the product is priced to produce returns that are consistent with our long-term goal. While we are reasonably confident in our estimates of loss content, particularly because the product was built largely on the foundation of Quantum Auto 1.0, it will take a few more quarters for us to know more. We will continue to roll this product out across the country and we are pleased that we now have a product that can successfully compete in this rapidly changing marketplace. Brian will speak more about Quantum 2.0, and we look forward to talking to you more about our strategy in personal insurance during our investor day on June 6.", "Finally, this morning we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend per share of 10% to $0.55 per share, which is the tenth consecutive year we\u2019ve increased our quarterly dividend. We note that the compound annual growth rate for our dividend over that time is 9.6%.", "With that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. By any measure, our first quarter results \u2013 record net and operating income per diluted share of $2.95, operating ROE of 17.8%, and a GAAP combined ratio of 85.7% - were exceptional. As was the case in recent quarters, these strong results were built upon very solid investment results primarily driven by private equity and real estate returns along with very strong underwriting performance. Within underwriting, earned rate increases continued to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments, although this benefit to our loss ratio was mostly offset by the severe CAT and non-CAT winter weather that gripped the country this quarter. Our loss ratio also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $294 million pre-tax, which was up $63 million from the prior year quarter, and was adversely impacted by catastrophe losses of $149 million pre-tax which were up $50 million. ", "In addition, our expense ratio benefited from a $76 million pre-tax reduction in an estimated liability for state assessment that we were required to pay in relation to our workers\u2019 compensation premiums. This reduction in our estimated liability resulted from a change in state law that took effect in the first quarter of 2014 that clarified our payment obligations.", "Each of our business segments once again produced net favorable prior year reserve development. In BI, net favorable development of $93 million was driven by better than expected loss experience for general liability excess coverages that resulted from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected, as well as favorable CAT and non-CAT property loss development partially offset by higher than expected loss experience for liability coverages within CMP. Net favorable development of $69 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contact surety and bond and financial products, while in PI net favorable reserve development of $132 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in homeowners and other for CAT and non-CAT weather-related losses. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subsidiaries\u2019 accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a de minimis amount, approximately $11 million, while each accident year in the period 2005 through 2013 developed favorably in this quarter. ", "Operating cash flows were very strong, a little over $700 million, and up from $530 million in the prior year quarter. We ended the quarter with over $1.6 billion of holding company liquidity and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.6 billion pre-tax or $1.7 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year mostly due to reductions in spreads. Book value per share was $73.06 or 7% higher than a year ago and 4% higher than at the beginning of this year.", "Turning to capital management, we continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $882 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $177 million and repurchased $705 million of our common shares, including $650 million under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $55 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. Finally, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.50 per share to $0.55, a 10% increase on top of last year\u2019s 9% increase.", "So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian McLean", "Thanks Jay. In business insurance, we had a very strong quarter with operating income of $653 million and a combined ratio of 87.7. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of CATs in prior year development, was 88.1 for the quarter, an improvement of four points year-over-year. As always, there were some moving pieces in the combined ratio this quarter, including a favorable non-recurring expense item and unfavorable non-CAT weather losses. Excluding these items, margin expansion driven by the impact of earned rate in excess of loss trends was about two points.", "Turning to production trends, beginning on Page 10, retention was up in the quarter to 81% while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 7%. The 7% included pure rate increases of about 5%, down about a point from last quarter. The rate increases continued to be broad-based and were led by commercial auto. New business volume in the quarter of $443 million was similar to recent periods.", "Loss trend continued to run at about 4% for the segment, so on a written basis rate gains continued to be above our current view of loss trend. The production results for the quarter within the segment tell somewhat different stories this quarter, so I\u2019d like to spend a moment discussing each of them individually.", "Beginning on Page 11 with select accounts, our small commercial business, the production metrics reflect the impact of our active strategy to improve the profitability on portions of this business. For some time, we have been taking the necessary actions to improve our returns, and those actions have been successful; consequently, we are shifting focus and rate expectations to retaining more of our business and are pleased with the four point improvement in retention this quarter. We also feel very good about the 9.2% renewal premium change we achieved for the quarter.", "Turning to commercial accounts on Slide 12, both the aggregate rate and retention were unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013, but as we\u2019ve commented before, it\u2019s not the aggregate number that we focus on. As we have successfully executed our strategy of improving the returns of this business over time, the headline aggregate rate increase number has moderated while retention has improved. We continue to execute a very granular strategy to retain our best performing accounts and to get significant rate increases on our poor performing business. As we enter the fourth year of implementing this strategy, our ability to execute is largely unchanged. So in summary, we continue to see a pretty stable commercial accounts market with rate and retention dynamics consistent with improving product margins.", "Looking at other business insurance on Slide 13, the environment is largely the same as for commercial accounts with the exception of the larger end of our national property business, specifically large layered property risks where we have seen rate pressure intensify. For perspective, our entire national property book represents about 5% of our total business insurance net written premiums, and the large layered programs are a subset of this. ", "In the financial, professional and international segment, operating income of $195 million was very strong and up 20% over the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by the inclusion of the Dominion, higher levels of underlying underwriting margins, and our decision to exit a management liability excess of loss reinsurance treaty in 2014. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 90%, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to earned rate in excess of loss trend across the segment along with the exit from the management liability reinsurance treaty I just mentioned, largely offset by the impact of the Dominion. ", "The Dominion had a negative impact of 2.2 points on the segment underlying combined ratio. This is the first quarter that reflects the full impact of the Dominion acquisition and I\u2019m pleased to say that the integration is proceeding in line with our expectations. Of course, we expect that the Dominion results will improve over time; however, given its relative size, we don\u2019t intend to spike it out going forward.", "Turning to production results, surety gross written premium of $216 million was up from $195 million in the prior year quarter, reflecting gains in contract surety. In management liability, retention and renewal premium change remain strong at 85% and 8% respectively while new business was down a little bit from recent periods. In international, retention continued to improve and came in at 83% for the quarter, renewal premium change rose to nearly 3%, and new business was up significantly year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion. So overall, a great quarter for the segment.", "In our personal insurance business, operating income of $268 million for the quarter was up 36% versus the first quarter of 2013, driven by higher net favorable reserve development in homeowners along with improved underlying underwriting results in both auto and home. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 87.4, and improvement of about two points versus the first quarter of 2013 due to lower expenses, along with rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by higher non-CAT weather-related losses. ", "Looking specifically at auto production, retention remains strong at 81%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume was up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of our new product, Quantum Auto 2.0. Jay spoke about how pleased we are with the early production results for Quantum 2.0, and I\u2019d like to take a moment to give you some additional color on our progress on the expense initiatives that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive.", "As you recall, in addition to a two-point commission reduction for the new product, we\u2019re taking actions on our operating expenses which will result in savings of about $140 million pre-tax. To date, we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about two-thirds of the $140 million run rate savings and we remain on target to achieve the full run rate saves by the end of this year, in line with our original expectations.", "As we mentioned last year, the operating expense reductions are primarily intended to benefit auto but will also benefit the homeowners results. In terms of impact on the combined ratio, the benefit from the operating expense reductions will be split roughly equally between the loss ratio due to claim expense reductions and the expense ratio due to other insurance expense reductions. We believe that the initial success of Quantum 2.0 is due not only to the delivery of a product with competitive price and a structure that better responds to consumer buying preferences, but also to the strength of our long-term relationships to the independent agent channel and the fact that we are a recognized brand in the marketplace.", "Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio was 92.3 for the quarter, an improvement of over a point versus the first quarter of 2013, and was driven by earned rate increases in excess of loss trend. Our current view of auto loss trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters.", "Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8.5% while retention remained at 84% and new business volume was up from the prior year quarter due in part to a lift from the improved auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio was approximately 80%, an improvement of close to 1.5 points versus the first quarter of 2013 and was driven by lower expenses, earned rate increases in excess of loss trend, partially offset by non-CAT weather-related losses.", "With that, let me turn it over to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Before we open it up for questions and answers, may I ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up, please. Thank you.", "We can now open it up for the question and answer period.", "Question and Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you very much. [Operator instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. I had a question, actually \u2013 Jay, has anything changed in terms of your philosophy around CAT or non-CAT weather reserving philosophy, just because it looks like this year and we\u2019ve seen a little bit recently non-CAT weather creates difficult comps on the underlying but provides for favorable reserve development for prior year. So is that coincidence that those\u2014I\u2019m just curious, has that changed in the last year or two? Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. There\u2019s no change in the way we go about reserving. Reserving is based on the actual storms that take place and then the assumptions that surround that, and one of the things that we\u2019ve had some difficulty with has been the weather patterns of the last several years. If you recall, not so much last year but the couple of years before that, when there was a lot of tornado experience that was creating both non-CAT as well as CAT weather, there was oftentimes a lot of hail with that and when the hail manifested itself, usually it was several months later and some cases even longer periods of time than that, and particularly last year what we saw when we had storm activity was first of all, an expectation on our part that the hail development would continue as we had been seeing it, and in fact what turned out to be the case was there was very little hail emersion, if you will, that came about. ", "So there\u2019s nothing really different about the way we\u2019re reserving, but it\u2019s just using the facts and circumstances that emerge over time to come up with the best estimates and then revise those when new information comes up.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got you. Great, thanks. I guess the other question I\u2019m talking about, really focusing on the lowest performing cohort and taking as much rate as you can there. Brian, it seems that that\u2019s also been a philosophy that\u2019s been in place for a little while. How much more do you think opportunity there is in that cohort to continue to push for right-sized rate? How long will it take to push that cohort into the good bucket? Thanks.", "Brian McLean", "Yeah, so a couple points in there. When you look at that cohort, we will continue to move stuff up\u2014we don\u2019t have the crystal ball to know exactly when and what we\u2019ll be able to do going forward. When we look at the results that we\u2019ve seen in recent quarters, we are encouraged that we don\u2019t see any change, so we continue to work it account-by-account. ", "You know, one of the things\u2014you started with we kind of get as much as we can. The philosophy is a little different than that. We\u2019re looking at these\u2014in every cohort, there\u2019s always a distribution of accounts. We\u2019re looking account by account within that cohort. We\u2019re trying to work with the customer and with the agent to come up with what\u2019s the appropriate number for that account. In aggregate, we\u2019ve been able to maintain at about that 20% rate increase level, but there\u2019s a distribution of accounts within there, so we\u2019ll continue to work at it.", "There will always be new business that we\u2019ll write that will\u2014you know, we don\u2019t write new business planning for it to be in cohort five, but there will be some that will end up there. There will be other accounts that will have loss experience that will have them deterioriate and they\u2019ll go down into cohort five; but as you can see from the data we showed, it is continuing to shrink so it will never get to zero. But right now, we feel pretty good that we are still able to take the actions we need to take on the accounts in that cohort, and where we can we\u2019re happy to retain the business, and where we can\u2019t we lose some of it.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay, great. That helps. Thank you very much.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you. The first question I had is on the merger and acquisition environment, and clearly we\u2019ve seen a more hostile environment emerge in Bermuda. I know that\u2019s not at all a focus area for Travelers, but Jay, I was wondering if you\u2019d focus on the M&A environment currently and whether you might be interested in more bolt-on deals like the Dominion opportunity, or perhaps even something more transformational.", "Jay Fishman", "Sure, Jay. We don\u2019t compete in the reinsurance arena at all, actually, so I don\u2019t have any particular insight into that segment or the dynamics around it. You all understand that, have a different view of that than I ever could, so I\u2019ll leave that to your commentary.", "Our own situation is really unchanged, which is that we\u2019ll look at anything because you always learn by whatever you look at, but our interest is very selective. We\u2019ve achieved a level of performance and returns and profitability that we at least domestically don\u2019t need to be any bigger to be successful. If we can be and continue to be successful, that\u2019s fine. Being bigger and being less successful is a bad trade-off, so we\u2019re always evaluating whatever we look at in the context of return on invested capital \u2013 on invested capital, importantly. It\u2019s margins, profitability, all that, so I\u2019d say that our interest domestically remains unchanged but relatively highly selective.", "We\u2019ve always said that there were a few environments outside the United States that from a long-term perspective we were quite interested in. Brazil was one of them and we had the opportunity to partner with the Malucelli firm, and that transaction has gone just really well. In the context of a joint venture where so many things can go wrong, so many things in this one have gone right, and it\u2019s really been a terrific experience. It\u2019s actually reinvigorated my belief that you can actually do a joint venture and have both parties feel good about it and be successful and do good business.", "Canada was opportunistic in that there were very few acquisition candidates that were really available. This was a decision by the owner of Dominion to exit the business strategically. We were approached with a very small number of other people, and it moved us, as I commented before, I think the numbers were from 21st largest in Canada to now the 10th largest, but at 21st you\u2019re not sustainable. It really becomes difficult to hire talented people, to invest in systems and infrastructure. I don\u2019t mean to say that the people who worked for Travelers of Canada were not talented \u2013 they obviously were. It just puts a stress on the organization, so having the opportunity to acquire Dominion, and then most importantly \u2013 most importantly \u2013 there were two elements of it that were intriguing to us. ", "First, we thought they were on the right path to doing the right things to make their own business more profitable. We thought we could accelerate the time frame, that our skills, size and scale, and our experience that we\u2019ve had could accelerate that. And then, the more intermediate and longer term aspect of taking our commercial products, exporting them up into Canada and using Dominion\u2019s remarkable distribution organization to leverage, that remains just right clear in focus. It\u2019s just so important for us to do. ", "I\u2019ve expressed before, although I\u2019m less optimistic that it will happen\u2014you know, I\u2019d love to find us in India in some way. The challenge there is that it takes a tremendous amount of time and investment \u2013 not dollars, because it\u2019s a relatively small market, time and investment in people and infrastructure, management attention for a 26% ownership, and it\u2019s difficult to make sense of that. If we had a higher degree of confidence that that regulatory prohibition would be lifted and it would become 49%, we\u2019d be more aggressive. There are certainly plenty of partners in India who have raised their hand and have expressed interest in partnering with us, so the identification of a partner is not the issue. The issue is making real sense of an investment longer term.", "You know, we\u2019re a P&C company \u2013 that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be. There may be other environments that will pop up and we\u2019ll take a look at. Continental Europe broadly is over-insured and under-returned, and doesn\u2019t hold a lot of excitement for us, so it\u2019s going to be case-by-case. We hope to use the venture in Brazil to look at other South American opportunities, so we\u2019ll continue to find those spots where we think that our skills, the attributes, the partner\u2019s ability to bring value to the transaction makes sense, and we\u2019ll invest in it. So that\u2019s as comprehensive an answer as I can give you.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "It\u2019s very comprehensive \u2013 thank you. And then just on capital management, with the increase in the dividend and the strong level of retained earnings, any thoughts as to whether Travelers could increase the combined share buyback and dividend to be more than an annual level of operating income going forward?", "Jay Benet", "Well, the basis upon which the capital management starts is with the operating company capital, so to the extent that you\u2019re making\u2014your earnings are creating capital that you don\u2019t need, that is the basis for the share buybacks and the dividends. We\u2019re always looking at other things that will free up capital. You might recall from a couple of years ago, we mentioned that we had reductions in the amount of reinsurance recoverables we had, or there was a sale of a runoff business, that both freed up capital. So we look for those kinds of opportunities, but those are things that may or not happen. The real juice, the real underlying current that gives rise to the ability to return capital, that\u2019s the earnings. ", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Good morning and congratulations on a great quarter. So first, just a question of the numbers and how we should think about them. Last year you guys ran, I think, over a 15% ROE; this quarter was nearly 18%, and the accident year ROE that you mentioned earlier, I think rounds up to 15. I know we all need to normalize for many things, as I think you guys do internally; but when you think about where you are, what should we think of as sort of where you are in your core run rate ROE, and how far really are you from the mid-teens ROE target that you have over time? I mean, are we there, and if not, how much\u2014if you sort of bring this back to the point, how much more rate momentum do you think you would need to get us to that target?", "Jay Fishman", "Josh, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We\u2019re not there \u2013 most definitively, we\u2019re not there. In order to achieve our goal, and it\u2019s not vague by intention, it\u2019s vague because our business is simply not as precise as some people tend to think. This mid-teens ROE over time, to achieve that, you\u2019re going to have to achieve periods of time where you exceed mid-teens, because there will be good weather, there will be bad weather, and that\u2019s going to move back and forth. So we still have to make progress, so there\u2019s no particular change in our approach, our philosophy, what we\u2019re trying to achieve.", "Jay will tell you that if you take out the workers\u2019 comp assessment change, that impacts ROE by \u2013 was it 90 basis points or something? By something like 90 basis points, so you can take the 14.6 and you can make it\u2014you know, there are so many moving parts and so many unusual\u2014unusual? Every quarter has unusual pluses and unusual minuses, and they just keep washing out over time.", "We have more to do if we\u2019re going to get back on track. At this level of interest rate, I\u2019m still not 100% convinced that it is achievable in today\u2019s environment. We said several quarters ago \u2013 I\u2019ll reiterate it today \u2013 it remains an aspirational goal. I think that it\u2019s critical in an organization to express a strategic goal, and absent something fundamentally changing that\u2019s permanent, sticking with it. It\u2019s not just words that we use here in a webcast; it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we price product, it\u2019s embedded in the systems by which we evaluate risk selection. It\u2019s what people in the field, underwriters, understand their mission to be, so we don\u2019t mess with it lightly. We leave it as is because it takes so long to get the DNA of an organization to reflect these strategic initiatives.", "We\u2019ve got two things going on: interest rates remain at overall historical lows, and the weather patterns are simply less predictable than they were. Both of those remain, and we are not yet at the pricing level, so we\u2019re going to keep going. I don\u2019t know exactly how to quantify it \u2013 I really don\u2019t. I\u2019m not holding back. I don\u2019t know how to quantify X-points of rate in various businesses and various product lines and help you\u2014I wish we had that kind of granular understanding about returns and losses and the rest. I just don\u2019t know how to do it. I just know that as I look at each quarter and analyze it and break it down, we\u2019re still not there yet.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s helpful. This is going to seem like a non sequitur in a way because you\u2019re still raising pricing, but if we\u2019re all sort of looking forward and trying to look maybe six months out again, so what we\u2019ll be talking about in six months and things like that. The question if I ask you sort of a bigger question, Jay, this used to be a boom and bust sector, and I think you called\u2014you know, among the first to sort of get the post-cycle idea out into the discussion three or four years ago, and no one believed you. But with improvements in data analytics and more responsible behavior across the board, we\u2019ve seen three years of pricing firming, so everybody is starting to dust off questions as pricing slows, look back at history and sort of what does history tell us. Last time we saw pricing start to slow, there was seven years of price cutting and a 40% decline in commercial lines. It was obviously a different story \u2013 you know, the backdrop was very different; but I\u2019m wondering as you guys sort of put your strategic planning hats on and you think about the market, can you help us think about what here has been structurally changed? If we were to put on a three to five-year view, what do you think we\u2019ll see if we move decisively past the firming part of the cycle?", "Jay Fishman", "Sure, and I\u2019ll start off by saying we could be wrong. Just because we believe it and manage our business that way, doesn\u2019t by definition mean it will be right. It\u2019s entirely possible that we just don\u2019t see it right, and it\u2019s important because otherwise you always have to consider the prospect of what if you\u2019re wrong.", "We\u2019ve been talking about much less amplitude in the cyclicality of our business for a lot more than three to five years. I think you can go back almost 10, certainly 8 where it began to get increasingly clear to us that the factors that we thought had contributed to that remarkable cyclicality were being moderated. They were much better data. I know that we led that effort because of our history, but we\u2019re not unique in the sense of one and only in that regard \u2013 better data, better analytics broadly across the business and the industry, particularly amongst the best competitors.", "I think that Sarbanes Oxley actually had a meaningful impact on our business. It brought boards of directors into the discussions of reserve setting and the controls and procedures behind it. Those were really good things not because they changed bad behavior, because you can presume that in my comment \u2013 I don\u2019t mean it that way \u2013 but it improved the processes. It\u2019s fundamentally improved the processes by which managements are held accountable, which boards embrace. That\u2019s a big deal. That was a meaningful change in our industry that I don\u2019t think a lot of people really understood, and I believe that now.", "So now, I\u2019ll tell you\u2014at least this is a Travelers\u2019 view. I\u2019m not speaking for anybody else, but I will tell you for us, the question that we get asked probably more than any other, which we just scratch our heads about, is now that returns are where you want them to be, why don\u2019t you grow? And talk about a non sequitur question \u2013 it\u2019s one that we so struggle to understand. There is a presumption in that question that we can moderate our rate gains on the margin and somehow grow our business and change behavior. First of all, I don\u2019t how to moderate thousands of transactions in any given quarter one at a time and move it on the margin. We give our folks tools, we give them processes, we give them goals, and we let them manage it; and the numbers in the end, end up the way they end up. We also don\u2019t believe that you can on the margin grow your business by cutting price marginally. I think \u2013 we think that\u2019s just a fool\u2019s approach to the business.", "If you really want to use price as that type of a competitive approach, you\u2019ve got to cut it to the point where you\u2019ll accept materially lower returns than anybody else. That will change it, and my guess is it will be at a level of profit that is simply unsupportable for the long term. So we at least, we reject the notion that you can moderate pricing to grow your business. ", "Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that we are free from that obligation. We try really hard to grow our businesses, and in many cases we\u2019ve been extremely successful. It\u2019s not been based on price; it\u2019s been based on risk selection \u2013 importantly, identifying the competitive advantages that you have in your business and applying them more broadly to business opportunities that arise. We had the best national accounts workers\u2019 comp business there was, and lots of you have been exposed to that and you understand the competitive dynamics that exist and the advantages we bring. Once we decided that we could apply that expertise to the small commercial business, we were able to grow that segment in small commercial meaningfully \u2013 really meaningfully, and it mattered. ", "In our middle market business when we decided to get much more specific and program-driven, less generalist, we\u2019ve actually been able to grow the premiums from going back to \u201905 a little over $2 billion to now a little over $3 billion in that business \u2013 real growth not by price, because in that period of time largely price has either been flat or its increased, but by identifying segments of risk \u2013 risk return where the return trade-off was worthwhile and it made sense for us to apply those competitive advantages.", "So we\u2019re not\u2014we may get dragged into it. Maybe there will be other competitors that will be willing to accept sub-par returns at a level that at some point force everybody to respond \u2013 that was the old days. I think the industry is smarter than that \u2013 I may be wrong, but I think it is. We\u2019re running our business with that in mind, and I\u2019m hopeful \u2013 hopeful \u2013 that that will convert into a financial services business, an industry in P&C that looks more like so many others \u2013 greater consistency, less volatility. That level of volatility is in no one\u2019s interest. It\u2019s not even in the customers\u2019 interest. It\u2019s in nobody\u2019s interest. Consistency of risk management and its costs are important economically, and I\u2019m hopeful that we will get there. But ultimately, every company makes its own decision, every company pursues its own strategy, so all I\u2019m expressing to you is ours, recognizing that we could be wrong. ", "But that\u2019s my view of why things are different, our view of why things are different today than they were perhaps 20 years ago.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s really helpful, Jay, thank you. Thanks, and good luck.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Hi, good morning. The first question is on the accident year loss ratio ex-CAT for the business insurance segment. We had some very small improvement, maybe around 20 basis points of year-over-year improvement in that segment, and I understand there is some non-CAT weather. But if you could help me understand how you look at these numbers, that would be helpful, given that pricing is in excess of lost cost trends. Thanks. ", "", "Brian McLean", "", "I lost track of the numbers you were doing, so you were looking at ex-CAT accident year\u2014", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Loss ratio, so that\u2019s about 60.2 points this quarter versus 60.4 points last year\u2019s first quarter, so that\u2019s a small improvement. Most of the improvement on the accident year combined ratio came from the expense ratio \u2013 I believe 150 basis points after the workers\u2019 comp. So since you\u2019re setting pricing in excess of loss cost, I would have thought that the loss ratio would have had more significant improvement.", "Brian McLean", "Yeah, okay. Jay\u2019s got the numbers, so\u2014", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, without getting into the specifics of it, yes is how we react to it. I mean, the way we react is we obviously have some very specific views as to what the components of the changes are, so in blowing apart that 20 basis points, we look at what is the impact of rate earned in versus loss trend, right, and how does that compare to prior quarters and are the trends that we had been seeing inherent in this number that we\u2019re seeing here. The answer to that is yes. ", "We continue to earn in rate in excess of loss trends, and then the next obvious question is well, okay, if that\u2019s the case, how come it\u2019s not showing up? As you had said, this is a quarter where the weather has on a non-CAT basis as well as a CAT basis in an area like business insurance been much more of an impact than it was in the first quarter of last year. When you think about the weather this particular quarter with the winter storms, one of the questions that we had been mulling over here was if you look at the relationship of weather-related losses in BI versus PI, personal insurance, while it had weather events this quarter, they really kind of looked not all that dissimilar from where they had been in the prior year, and in the case of BI they were much higher both in terms of CAT and non-CAT. In looking further at that, we find that in business insurance, you\u2019re dealing with insureds that have many more flat roofs that when there are ice storms and snowstorms sustain more damage than sloped roofs and homes that people own, and then secondarily you have a lot of sprinkler systems in businesses and when sprinkler systems freeze and then water damage results, the damage is extensive, much more so than the homeowners business.", "So in pulling all these things apart, we look at the data, we look at the relationships, we look at the causality and see that it all makes sense to us, and in this particular case what you are seeing are the 20 basis points of improvement, but it is really the rate in excess of loss trend benefit being offset in large measure by the weather.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up to that, we\u2019ve seen the expense ratio improve meaningfully. In this segment, that\u2019s the business insurance segment and the other segments. Curious as to whether this is repeatable and whether this is a function of management action because you feel the pace of rate increases are now starting to moderate. Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, there\u2019s a combination of stories here. First of all, in business insurance, business insurance is where the benefit that we called out in the press release relating to the workers\u2019 comp assessments is coming through, so that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of what\u2019s taking place here. We continue to manage expenses very, very carefully in business insurance, and we are getting some benefit of expense leverage here that is also contributing to the reduction that you\u2019re seeing. But the primary driver in business insurance was the reevaluation of the estimated liability that we called out.", "In other areas, we have changes in commission rates that we\u2019ve talked about that have come through, also the expense saves that we talked about in PI. So there\u2019s lots of different stories, but it all goes back in most cases to a very diligent view as to how to manage expenses in those plays.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Helpful, thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie ", "Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions. The first question is on loss cost trends in business insurance. Maybe using California comp as a backdrop, has anything changed in terms of loss cost trends when you look at Q1 versus Q4?", "Brian McLean", "This is Brian. The short answer is no. Your comment of taking California comp as a backdrop, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever use California comp as a standard for things broadly across the book of business. So in our comp business and the other lines, really no significant movements at all this quarter from what we have been seeing historically.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "I can see now I was unclear. I was alluding to SB863 and its impact. ", "Brian McLean", "Yeah, specifically in California?", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "Yes.", "Brian McLean", "You know\u2014yeah, I don\u2019t think we want to go that granular in talking about specific trends. I mean, we\u2019ve got a decent-sized book in California and continue to manage it on a granular basis and feel good about it, but\u2014yeah. Everything, all those changes are reflected in the results that we\u2019ve got in our book, so we would prefer not to delve that deeply into one state\u2019s specific actions.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. I guess sort of switching gears and going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0, it\u2019s in 28 states right now. What I was trying to get at was how should we sort of think about the impact it might be having on premiums right now, i.e. is there some way to sort of segregate the impact when we look at the numbers?", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s Jay Fishman. In the aggregate, no. Were we to dive into the individual states where the product has been rolled out, what you would see \u2013 I\u2019m trying to recall \u2013 almost universally, maybe that\u2019s not exactly so, but you would see a meaningful increase in new business in each of those states. Because it\u2019s only been out for a few months and it\u2019s only still out in 28 states and the DofC, there is still some time to go before it evidences itself in our numbers. ", "I think the best that I could provide to you\u2014this is not a budget, I want to make it clear. It\u2019s not a budget; it is to some extent a guess on our part, and of course competitive reaction can change all of this. Our guess is that if we keep going at the pace and things remain as unchanged as they are now, that by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, we will achieve break-even status, meaning that in the fourth quarter the book will no longer be shrinking. So it will shrink again in the second quarter, it will shrink again in the third. By the time we get to the fourth, we should be able to hit break-even, and that gives you, I think, a sense of its intermediate term impact on a book of our size.", "Remember that it\u2019s all new is coming out on 2.0. Dual is at the agent\u2019s discretion based upon the individual customer\u2019s need, and I\u2019m being reminded her by everybody that in my comment about the fourth quarter is that that\u2019s policies in force, not premium dollars. Policies in force should, we hope given everything we see, we\u2019d project to flatten out in the fourth quarter.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "Got it. That is extremely helpful. ", "Gabriella Nawi", "Sorry \u2013 this is Gabi. Just to remind you that you can also see on Page 18 of the webcast that new business in auto has picked up pretty meaningfully, and that\u2019s obviously largely driven by Quantum 2.0.", "Jay Fishman", "Totally driven.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Totally driven.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "Yes, that\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answer.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. Two questions. The first is in the management liability business, we see an increase\u2014an acceleration, I should say, of the price increase. I guess I\u2019m a little surprised by that. I\u2019m wondering what\u2019s happening in that business. And then secondly related to Canada and Dominion, are you able to take capital out of that business now, and if not, when will you be able to?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, it\u2019s Alan Schnitzer. Let me start with the first one and then I\u2019ll turn the second one over to Jay. In management liability, what you\u2019re seeing there is our peak seasonal price change. That\u2019s got two components \u2013 one is rate and one is exposure, so the rate underlying that sequentially in quarters would be pretty consistent, up slightly but I would call it consistent with the prior quarter. What you see in addition to that, though, is exposure, and that\u2019s us being able to improve our position in some accounts that have been performing well, and in some cases from an excess position to a primary layer, and then just an improvement in ratable. So it\u2019s really those two pieces that you\u2019re seeing there.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Sorry \u2013 it\u2019s Gabi. Just to clarify, it\u2019s renewal premium change on the page in the webcast, not renewal price change.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it.", "Jay Benet", "As it relates to your question about the capital position and taking capital out of Canada, the first and foremost is looking at the opportunity that we have with Dominion to both integrate it, get it into the Travelers in as seamless a fashion as we can, and then take advantage of the business opportunities up in Canada. So we will maintain a capital base in Canada that will support those business activities, and your question is a good one but it\u2019s complicated by both profitability and growth, and we\u2019ll just manage it very carefully up there.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Great, thanks. On the change in the SMA liability for workers\u2019 comp state assessments, could you clarify what states that applies to and what exactly changed in the nature of that assessment?", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, this is Jay Benet again. The state is New York State, and New York has been going through some rethinking of how they manage things associated with workers\u2019 comp. You might recall from last year, I think it was in the first quarter, maybe the second\u2014the first? We had had a change in the way certain reopened workers\u2019 comp claims were funded, and that actually had a cost to us last year that went through prior year development. What New York State has done recently is change the way they fund the workers\u2019 comp bureaus in New York, and effective 1/1 of this year instead of doing something that they had done historically \u2013 and without getting into all the complications associated with it \u2013 we had, along with others, charged policyholders surcharges in particular years and then collected those. That was the basis upon which we were supposed to be funding at a later time what the costs were that we were being assessed by New York State for operating their various bureaus. There was a disjoint, frankly, between what our surcharges were and what we were actually assessed by the State of New York, and at times we saw that assessment being higher than what we had collected and that caused us to look at our obligations for that and build up an estimated liability associated with that.", "When New York State changed the law effective 1/1, it didn\u2019t change the surcharges we had collected; in fact, there was a true-up period where you looked back four years from that date, you looked at what you assessed in that time frame\u2014I\u2019m sorry, what the surcharges were in the time frame, what you had paid, and then settled up with New York. And we paid that, but what it did was it eliminated going forward this uncertainty as to a breakage, if you will, between the surcharges and the assessment. So this estimated liability for that breakage in effect was what we no longer required, and going forward the matching of the surcharges and the payments to New York State will be something that will be very definable, so there\u2019s really no need for this estimated liability anymore. It\u2019s a one-time thing. It\u2019s a true-up, and it\u2019s not something that will recur. ", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "And it transfers to the expense ratio rather than the loss ratio because it\u2019s more of a pay-as-you-go?", "Jay Benet", "No, it\u2019s goes through taxes, licenses and fees. It\u2019s just the way statutory accounting works. ", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Okay. Understood. I guess the follow-up there is that everything you described is more procedural, but has there been any other kind of reform or structural change to the way New York approaches that second injury fund?", "Jay Benet", "Nothing this year. Like I said, last year there was a change\u2014", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Nothing like an SB863 in California? Nothing to fix the real problem \u2013 this is more just procedural on how it operates?", "Jay Benet", "This is procedural as to how the funding of this particular element operates, yes.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Okay, that\u2019s perfect. Thanks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Adam Klauber with William Blair. Please go ahead.", "Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. My question is around workers\u2019 comp. Clearly you\u2019ve been working on that line pretty hard, and the accident year in 2013 came down by several hundred basis points. For this year and next year, can we expect more of a gradual change, or is it possible you could see some more significant improvement also?", "Brian McLean", "You\u2019re talking about in the combined ratio in the\u2014", "Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair", "Yeah, in the workers\u2019 comp.", "Brian McLean", "It\u2019s tough to forecast what we\u2019re going to see. I mean, I think we feel great about our comp experience and the capabilities we have and the risk selection we\u2019ve gone through, and feel confident that we\u2019re appropriately recording the things as we see them today.", "Jay Fishman", "And our pricing strategies, it\u2019s similar to what we described earlier. Where there are accounts that have been poor performing or under-returned, we\u2019ve been seeking rate gains to improve the profitability, and ultimately that will evidence itself in the numbers. So I\u2019m not\u2014yeah, other than that, do loss costs develop as we contemplate they will, that\u2019s always the variable.", "Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair", "Okay. And how are medical loss cost trends running?", "Brian McLean", "Consistent with what our expectations have been. We\u2019re not going to disclose specific numbers there \u2013 I don\u2019t think we have in the past, but we\u2014you know, you can read what\u2019s going on in medical loss cost inflation broadly in society and in the economy, and it\u2019s higher than normal inflation but something that\u2019s consistent. I think for us, one of the things that is really fundamental to our success in this line is literally 20 years ago, we decided we were going to invest heavily in our abilities to manage the medical component of the comp claims, and I think we\u2019ve got clearly industry-leading capabilities there and that really matters for us. So we\u2019re obviously looking at what the trend is on our book, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s different than what other companies are seeing, but it\u2019s clearly been within our expectations and something we watch very, very closely but right now feel good about.", "Adam Klauber \u2013 William Blair", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. This will be our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Capital. Please proceed with your question.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital", "Thanks. I\u2019ll make it a quick one. I think last quarter, Alan kind of suggested that for SBI to think in terms of 92 underlying combined ratio for this year. The first quarter came in a couple of points better than that, and you guys referenced the management liability treaty as being partly a factor. Does that change that suggested guidance for the year?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Hi Larry, it\u2019s Alan. No, it doesn\u2019t. So we certainly took that into account when we gave the outlook a quarter ago, so if you look in our 10-Q and you look in the outlook, we really say the same thing about the balance of the year, meaning the next three quarters we expect to be broadly consistent with full-year \u201913. So obviously, we did come in under that in the first quarter, so if you just do the math, that would suggest a slight improvement on the full year. But again, I\u2019d just point you back to the words broadly consistent and tell you that we continue to expect the same.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital", "Okay, great. Thanks. ", "Operator", "Ms. Nawi, I will now turn the call back over to you. Please continue with your presentation or closing remarks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "", "Very good. Thank you all for joining us today.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our second quarter 2014 results. Hopefully you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We\u2019re quite pleased with the strong results we posted this quarter, particularly given the magnitude of our catastrophe and non-catastrophe weather losses. Operating income was $673 million or $1.93 per share. Operating return on equity was 11.04% and we continue to make great progress on lifting our returns, largely in response to continuing very low interest rates and continuing volatile weather. Who would have thought that we\u2019d be talking about a polar vortex in July and at 2.5% ten year treasury in 2014?", "As demonstrated on slide four of the webcast, comparing this quarter\u2019s earnings to last year is more than accounted for by the tax and legal settlement gains of $122 million, recognized in last year\u2019s second quarter as well as the difference in catastrophe losses quarter-to-quarter.", "The short story for each of our business segments is good. In Personal Insurance we are really pleased with the marketplace response and production trends. The manual personal auto program Quantum 2.0. While we need more talent, more time and data, the very early on loss indications are encouraging and consistent with our expectations. Our financial, professional and international insurance segment produced record results, with good results from both the bond and financial products business and the international business.", "In Business Insurance, we continue to generate strong returns as underlying, underwriting margins on an earned basis, continued to expand and written rate gains in the quarter approximated loss trend. Because there was so much interest in our assessment of the rate environment in Business Insurance, we are going to spend a few minutes on that this morning, before I turn it over to Jay.", "At our recent Investor Day, we were struck by the fact that one analyst asked a question about rate, but started off by saying that he knew we didn\u2019t like talking about aggregate rate indicators. That\u2019s just not so, but the critical caveats in discussing the headline rate, are that first we do not manage rate in the aggregate. We manage it account-by-account or class-by-class, and the actions that we take ultimately add up to a single number.", "This granularity is evidenced on slide 15 of the webcast, which we\u2019ve shared with you before.", "The slide is the distribution by rate gain of our commercial accounts business for the second quarter of 2014. And Brian will talk more about this analysis later.", "Second, we believe that there can be an incorrect assessment of the competitive environment, based upon the direction of the headline number. Let me say again what I\u2019ve said many times before, we are a return driven organization.", "We have talked with you before and have shared with you data, which demonstrates that the success we are having in improving returns, is based upon achieving rate gains on our poor performing business and maximizing retention on our best performing business. And we\u2019ve also said before, if we are successful, the headline rate gain will inevitably decline over time.", "There is a conventional reaction amongst many industry observers that this decline reflects as many we put it, a more competitive environment. We just don\u2019t see it that way, given our ability to continue to achieve strong levels of retention at increasing returns approaching our targets. If we have an account where we\u2019ve been successful at increasing returns over time and that account has now reached an appropriate level of profitability, it would be unwise of us to attempt to continue to increase rate significantly on that account and risk the relationship with the agent and customer.", "Consequently, we just caution everyone from reacting to the decline in the headline number as an indication that the environment generally has become meaningfully and broadly more competitive.", "At least for us the environment has become more rate adequate and we are executing account-by-account and class-by-class. So now after three plus years of actions resulting in improved returns and profitability the question is where from here. We\u2019ve been reluctant to use the phrase soft landing because we believe that the phrase is often mischaracterized to mean that somehow we have finished attempting to improve the performance of our portfolio.", "Nothing can be further from the truth, we remain concerned that weather volatility remains problematic and we are not convinced that each of our catastrophe exposed property accounts is priced to reflect that volatility. In addition not every line or every class of business is performing at the same level. For example we are not satisfied with the returns on our commercial auto book particularly in select and we will continue to analyze that portfolio and take the actions necessary to improve it.", "So we have more work to do, but there are lots of accounts that after years of successful rate and underwriting actions are now at return levels that are consistent with our return threshold and our expression of the soft landing relates to that portion of the book what we have achieved so much. We don\u2019t see anything in the marketplace that suggests that we are at a precipice whether the increased churning of accounts were significant across the board, the rate of declines are imminent.", "Of course we could be wrong about this, we know we operate in a fragmented marketplace with lots of competition. But we can only share with you our strategy. From our view it is more or the same and as we share with you at Investor Day we are going to relentlessly leverage competitive advantages. It should allow us to out select and out price our competition. We expect to produce earnings and capital substantially in excess of what we need to support our business and we will continue to return that excess capital to shareholders.", "In short, nothing new and no shift, we feel very well positioned to continue our mission to creating superior shareholder value. And with that let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. Let me start by saying that we are very pleased with our results this quarter particularly taking weather into account. Our investment results continue to be very solid driven by private equity returns as were our underlined underwriting results. Within underwriting earned rate increases continue to exceed loss cost trends in each of our business segments. Al though the benefit to earnings into loss ratio was partially offset by higher non-CAT weather related losses this quarter versus the prior year quarter.", "Underwriting also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of $183 million pre-tax down slightly from the prior year quarter and was negatively impacted by CAT losses of $436 million pre-tax up $96 million from the prior year quarter. We provided two analyses in the webcast this quarter to help you better understand the relationship of operating income to both the prior year quarter and to analyst estimates.", "Jay already discussed the first analysis shown on page four of the webcast which provides insight as to why operating income decreased from the prior year quarter. The second analysis shown on page five of the webcast provides insight as to why operating income was less than the consensus estimate. The CAT loss estimates contained within the consensus estimates where significantly lower than our actual CAT losses. We hope this type of analysis is helpful to you.", "Each of our business segments once again experienced net favorable prior year reserve development and BI net favorable development of $25 million was driven by better than expected loss experience in general liability excess coverages for accident years 2008-2012 resulting from a more favorable legal and judicial environment than we had expected. This was partially offset by an $87 million increase to our environment reserves.", "Net favorable reserve development of a $146 million in FP&II primarily resulted from better than expected results in contract surety within bond and financial products. While in PI net favorable development of $12 million was primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in home owners and other were non-CAT weather related losses in the 2013 accident year. Year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our US subs only accident year 2004 and prior developed unfavorably by a very modest amount $73 million due to the strengthening of environmental reserves.", "All other accident years 2005-2013 developed favorably. We\u2019ve included an overview of CAT reinsurance coverage on page 22 of the webcast which has been structured in a way that is generally consistent with the prior year. Effective July 1, we renewed our Gen CAT treaty keeping both the attachment point and the dollar amount of recovered loss as the same as last year.", "Recovered losses of up to $400 million within the $1.5 billion to $2.25 billion layer, also effective July 1, we renewed our North East Gen CAT treaty with the same $2.25 billion attachment point as last year with an increased dollar amount of recovered losses up to $850 million this year as compared to $600 million last year. Given the current reinsurance marketplace both renewals were accomplished at lower rates online and with improved terms and conditions, including amending the loss accounts definition so that all win losses have a duration of a 168 hours rather than 96 hours.", "A more complete description of our CAT reinsurance coverage including a description of our two long point PRE-CAT bonds our Gen-CAT aggregate excess of loss treaty that covers an accumulation of certain property losses arising from multiple occurrences, our earthquake coverage and our international coverage is included in our second quarter 10-Q which we filed earlier today as well as in our 10-K.", "We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses allowing us to return $1.065 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $190 million and repurchased $875 million of our common shares under our publicly announced share repurchase program consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. Operating cash flows remain strong a little over $600 million. And we ended the quarter with over $1.8 million of holding company liquidity. All of our capital ratios exceeded our target levels and we ended the quarter with a debt to a capital ratio of 21.3% well within our target range.", "Net unrealized investment gains rose to approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or $2 billion after tax up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to lower interest rates. And book value per share of $75.32 was 30% higher than a year ago and over a 7% higher than the beginning of the year.", "One final note as you know we are revising our business segments and related disclosures to reflect the management changes that were announced on June of 10th and became effect on July 1.", "Accordingly we report third quarter results using the new segment structure. We are currently in the process of restating our 2013 Form 10-K and our second quarter 2014 Form 10-Q and our financial supplements for the periods contained therein to reflect the new segment structure. And we expect to make these restated documents available to you in early September. So with that let me turn things over to Brain.", "Brian McLean", "Thanks Jay, in business insurance second quarter operating income was $409 million and the combined ratio was 99%. The underlying combined ratio which excludes the impact of CAT\u2019s and prior year reserve development was 92.1% for the quarter, an improvement of a 4 percentage point year-over-year. And 90.1% for the first half of 2014, an improvement of 2.5 points over the first half of 2013, the point of improvement in the quarter was driven by about 2 points of earned rate in excess of loss trends partially offset by about a point of non-CAT weather losses.", "So despite the significant impact of weather solid profitability in the quarter. Turning to production trends beginning on page 11, retention of 81% was strong and slightly higher than recent periods. New business volume of $486 million was 8% was higher quarter-over-quarter while renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent periods at about 6%.", "The 6% included pure rate increases of about 4% which was about a point lower than the last quarter. As has been the case for last 13 quarters all major lines of business had positive rate change with the largest change this quarter coming in commercial auto. Not surprisingly auto was the line of business with the lowest return and accordingly the greatest rate need. Loss trend for the segment continued to run at about 4% so on an aggregate written basis, rate gains approximated our current view of loss trends.", "We believe the production results both in the aggregate and by line of business are appropriate given our view of product returns. But as Jay mentioned in his comments we don\u2019t manage the business in an aggregate or total line level. We execute it account-by-account or class-by-class and this is demonstrated on slide 15 which displays the distribution of renewal rate changes for commercial accounts in the second quarter.", "As you can see from the slide most accounts received a single digit rate increase. But there were numerous accounts that got a rate increase greater than 10% or got some level of rate decrease. There were also some general trends in the portfolio, recently larger accounts have lower average rate changes. And has been the case for several quarters commercial auto accounts have higher average rate changes and there\u2019s always individual account loss experience matters.", "But the real take away from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions. And accordingly success in this business is not about achieving a higher aggregate rate number, it\u2019s about doing the right things for the right account and generating an appropriate return over time.", "So in this context our fundamental approach is unchanged and the results continue to be encouraging. Simply put, we are retaining a very high percentage of our best performing accounts at relatively modest rate increases. While on our poor performing business, we continue to get rate increases significantly above loss trend, with lower retentions. We are comfortable moving away from business where returns remain well below target levels and as always we actively look for new business opportunities with appropriate returns.", "We continue to be very comfortable with how our organization is executing at the granular level and accordingly feel very good about the results.", "In the financial, professional and international segment we had record operating income of $254 million, which was 65% higher than the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development, improved underlined, underwriting margins, lower catastrophe losses and the inclusion of the Dominion.", "The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 89 two, a slight improvement from the prior year. The improvement was due to the 2014 exit from a management liability excessive loss reinsurance treaty, along with earned rate increases in excess of loss cost trend across the segment largely offset by the impact of the Dominion.", "Net written premium was up 38% in the quarter compared to the prior year, due to the inclusion of Dominion. In the management liability business within bond of financial products, retention of 84% and new business of $37 million were both consistent with recent periods in prior year, while renewal premium changed of about 4% was down somewhat from recent periods.", "In the international, retention remains strong at 80% while renewal premium change improved to 3% and new business was up year-over-year due to the impact of Dominion, so overall a great quarter for the segment.", "In our personal insurance business, operating income of $75 million for the quarter was down 47% compared to the second quarter of 2013, driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and home owners, along with higher levels of catastrophe related losses in both auto and home.", "The underlined combined ratio for the quarter was 89.8 a slight improvement over the second quarter of 2013 with lower underwriting expenses and rate increases in excess of loss trends, largely offset by higher non-cap weather related losses.", "Looking specifically at auto on the production side, retention remains strong at 82%, renewal premium change was about 6%, while new business volume of 139 million was once again up significantly versus recent periods due to the rollout of Quantum Auto 2.0. We continue to be very pleased with the early results for Quantum Auto 2.0, the product is now live in 31 states and those states represent about 85% of our countrywide auto new business production. In the states where we\u2019ve launched the product, we\u2019ve seen quoted policies increase more than 10%, while the number of policies issued has more than doubled from pre-launch levels.", "In addition, we continue to make progress on the expense initiatives announced a year-ago that are fundamental to our ability to make our auto product more price competitive. To date we\u2019ve executed on initiatives responsible for about 75% of the $140 million run rate savings target and we remain on track to achieve the full run rate sales by the end of the year in line with our original expectations.", "Turning to auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.2 for the quarter, was a slight improvement compared to the second quarter of 2013 with earned rate increases more than offsetting loss trend, and the impact of higher mix of new business versus renewal business volumes. Our current view of auto loss cost trend remains at about 4% with no significant change in the underlying texture from previous quarters.", "Looking at homeowners, production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 8% while retention remained at 84%, new business volume of $85 million was up from the prior year quarter and recent periods due in part to account rounding on our auto new business. From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 81.5 was in line with the second quarter of 2013, with earned rate increases in excess of loss trend and lower expenses, offset by non-CAT weather-related losses.", "So overall in personal insurance, we saw strong profitability and an improving production picture. With that let me turn it back over to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "I\u2019m sorry there is an addition from Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Yes thanks Gabi, before we open for questions I did want to mention one additional item. We\u2019d be remiss if we did not say how pleased we were to have been recognized as a A++ company by AMBEST [ph] this past May so we just thought we\u2019d end with that and we\u2019d be happy to take your questions now.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Kelly we are ready for the question and answer portion. May I ask that you all limit yourself to one question and one follow-up please? Thank you.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Yes, thanks couple of quick questions here for you. First of all Jay, just curious, if I look at the business insurance, and you kind of strip out the reserve releases and you can normalize for CAT losses. I kind of come up with about a 12% underlying return equity for the business, I guess my first question is that right, and is that about where you\u2019re kind of targeting given the current interest rate environment?", "Brian McLean", "I\u2019ll answer the second part of it; I\u2019ll let Jay Benet \u2013 if he does the math in his head. We\u2019ve been saying for some time that our stated target of achieving the mid-teens return on equity overtime was simply really not achievable in this interest rate environment, but we were willing to keep it as a statement, an aspiration goal but also because so much, so many of our systems and our culture are geared around it. Having said that, we\u2019ve chosen to avoid the notion of an artificial ceiling on what rate adequacy or return adequacy is on an individual line or an individual business. Some of that is driven by competitive dynamics, what is the rest of the marketplace doing, some of it is based upon capacity.", "So I \u2013 it feels obviously at 2.5% tenure treasury, a 12% number feels pretty good, but that doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to not pick the actions on an account-by-account or class-by-class basis, that would continue to lift it if it\u2019s possible. So that\u2019s really our honest assessment of it, it feels pretty good to us, but maybe there\u2019s more and we\u2019re certainly going to try, but that again is a specific comment more than it is an aggregate rate number. It\u2019s so important that we always keep that in mind, we price individual accounts, we don\u2019t price the portfolio.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "But if you\u2019re pricing right now in line with trend, isn\u2019t that kind of mean you\u2019re assuming that return to adequate?", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019m sorry Brian try me again.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "You said you\u2019re pricing, you\u2019re pricing your business insurance in line with loss trend right?", "Jay Fishman", "Oh no, no what Brian said was that our best accounts are getting modest loss trend. I believe I\u2019m trying to go back to his comments and that our poorer performing accounts, whatever that means in that framework if the three years of rate increases, but there are always poorer performing accounts, if the poor performing accounts are getting significantly more rate increase at lower retention.", "Jay Benet", "So another way to say that Brian is this quarter, the way the arithmetic worked out, is rate that we got on the entire portfolio approximated the aggregate loss trend, but that could be very different and we could be thrilled with the result or unhappy with the result either direction depending on how we get there.", "Jay Fishman", "And I think the other part of that, that really is important, is that we wouldn\u2019t contemplate that we can improve our profitability by getting meaningful rate increase on our best performing business. Our focus there is to do our best to offset trend and to maximize retention. Our improvement in profitability is going to come from identifying those segments that under perform. And continuing to make real progress there, I recall in the last quarter, we actually put up a slide which showed the rate gain in our fifth bucket in commercial accounts I think.", "I can\u2019t remember whether it was commercial or middle market, but compared to the number of accounts in the rate gain to the previous year\u2019s quarter, and the rate gain in that fifth bucket, was 21% I think last year and 20% this year was the rate gain. That\u2019s where the improvement and profitability is going to come from, not just from that shift class, but that\u2019s the example here. It\u2019s going to be identifying those segments that continue to underperform and continuing to drive one.", "Brian Meredith \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "The other thing I would add before I\u2019ll address your first question is that we have this internal discussion about margin improvement. And you have to look at it in terms of what you\u2019re talking about. Are you talking about combined ratio or you are talking about dollars. And when you talk about combined ratio, now if you do the arithmetic, if you\u2019re covering loss trend let\u2019s make up some numbers, let\u2019s say you have a 60% loss ratio, obviously premiums were at the 100%.", "If you\u2019re covering loss trend that\u2019s 4% with rate increases, you\u2019re multiplying the denominator and the numerator by the same number. And you come up with the same combined ratio at the end of it 60%, loss ratio, 60% in this case, which you lose track of in that of the dollars because you\u2019re applying a 4% increase to a 100 and another 4% increase to 60% of that. So you\u2019re actually increasing the dollars of margin and increasing profitability, therefore, even when you\u2019re loss trend.", "So I just say that for all of you to keep in my mind that you\u2019ve got to look at it as to what question you\u2019re really asking. Is combined ratio changing or dollars of margin changing. Getting back to the first question about the overall returns, we do an analysis of our quarters, our year-to-dates. And if I look at the year-to-date operating return on equity, which was 14.6%, there is prior year development in there. Prior year development to our accounts, because a lot of it relates to recent periods where we\u2019ve seen trends different than what we expected and they\u2019ve been favorable.", "So in any given period, you can adjust for, but if you look at the 14.6% and back out the amount of PYD and divide by the average equity, you\u2019ll come up with something that looks like a proxy for an accident year, this year. So that\u2019s a way of looking at it, but as Jay said, we look at these returns over time, and we try to manage as close as we can to that mid-teen\u2019s goal.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed with your question.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Hi, good morning. I was hoping you could maybe review the topical issue the connections between the insurance market and primary market, particularly in the large account basis and just giving the fact that we\u2019ve seen a lot of rate decline and of reinsurance and how should we think about that affecting your businesses as the competitive environment changes a bit?", "Jay Fishman", "Hi Paul, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We think a lot of pitching a little on that, first I just observed that broadly speaking, we are really not a large account writer. I suspect in the context of the question that you\u2019re asking, we are a small commercial and middle market account company. We do large accounts on a fee for service basis that are largely independent of the reinsurance decisions. And we obviously do some national property business; we certainly do that for large accounts.", "Anecdotally, although some evidence I think exists, the layered national property business, and my recollection, we did this last quarter. I think it\u2019s less than 5% of our premium business overall but the layered large account property business is a much more a price sensitive price driven marketplace, more challenging than it was before.", "Now there are returns in that segment that are awfully attractive, and so you\u2019ve got to balance up the notion of competitive dynamics within the overall returns. But nonetheless, I think you\u2019re seeing, we think you\u2019re seeing some of the changes in the new capital formation. Whether it\u2019s reinsurance by the way, or excess in surplus, bumping into that layered national property account business.", "And I would say on a primary side, for us, that\u2019s probably where the impact is most significant. I\u2019m trying to see if anybody else here has a different view? We\u2019re really not \u2013 our treaty reinsurance is, for a company of our size, relatively modest. And so we\u2019ve got either savings opportunities, they\u2019re nice but they\u2019re not going to move the needle very much, or we can change the way in which we purchase. We can but more for the same dollars or less for even fewer dollars, but on the margin, it doesn\u2019t change anything.", "I\u2019ve been asked a few times whether in this, is an opportunity for us, and I suspect that what people are thinking is, does the calculus behind primary exposure change? Would you be willing to do either different classes of business or more business, particularly in catastrophe exposed areas and rely more on reinsurance to produce an acceptable return.", "So far the answer for us is no, that we worry a lot about the mismatch of business, we worry a lot about relying on reinsurance as a strategic solution rather than as a risk balancing factor, if you like. And the notion of expanding our liability base and relying on a reinsurance contract to bail us out.", "We were not quite sure of that reinsurance capacity really sticks, is it permanent, is it really there for the long haul? It\u2019s just not clear to us yet. So for us, the answer is that the impact of all of this is not yet very much. We spend, not an insignificant amount, talking about it and thinking about ways in which it could impact us, but so far, I think you\u2019re hard pressed other than that layered national property business to find an area where it\u2019s really having an impact.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill", "Maybe another fundamental question here, you\u2019d obviously talked a lot about how focusing on that renewal rate number and commercial insurance is not necessarily the best measure of what your assessment of the competitive environment. What\u2019s the alternative for us to look at and also illustrate?", "Jay Fishman", "That\u2019s actually a great question and I think you asked it actually in exactly the right way. It\u2019s not that the number doesn\u2019t have arithmetic meaning, we acknowledge it does, but the tendency to perceive it as a competitive indicator, we just don\u2019t see that. We\u2019ve always said, and have for many years, that retention is going to be the leading indicator of a changing competitive environment.", "And I\u2019ll go back to the last really difficult pricing environment that we had, which was back into the \u201890s, you\u2019ll see retention rates in middle market drop down into the high 60s. And that really defined what was going on, there was tremendous churn in the marketplace. It didn\u2019t happen overnight, but retention rates declined and that followed, that led, if you will, the overall rate dynamic.", "Now we haven\u2019t seen that yet, we haven\u2019t seen it on the way up, we haven\u2019t seen it \u2013 we\u2019re still on the way up, although we\u2019re at slower rates. We just haven\u2019t seen a drop in retention, and we said for a long time, that we think that\u2019s the principle indicator. Now we also, to provide whatever anecdotal observation we can, we often have provided you with commentary about what we\u2019re hearing from the field.", "They had to take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s right, but there are observations from people in the field dealing with individual accounts every day. And our comments remain, that there\u2019s nothing that we\u2019re hearing from our folks that would cause us to think that we\u2019re at a precipice or broadly a more meaningfully competitive environment, but I watch retention. And that\u2019s what I look at, and when I see a drop in that, that\u2019s when it\u2019s time to begin to understand what\u2019s going on in that local environment.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning. Thank you so much for taking my call, my question is regarding to the segmentation changes and management change recently. Could you comment a little bit more on that?", "Brian McLean", "We have much more to say, we put out a press release its part of management\u2019s responsibility, our responsibility here is to make sure that the younger talent in the organization gets additional exposure internally, exposure externally and position the company for continuity and just felt to us like a very ordinary and inappropriate thing to do. The real alignment was to a great extent, driven by reporting relationships within those changes, so much more about the people than about any particular realignment about the business.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great just follow-on that and Jay has done a wonderful job for the company and the shareholders and is this the recent management change is part of evolution about how the boards think about the succession plan?", "Jay Fishman", "Well I would never speak for the board and so \u2013 we think we have a responsibility to develop talent and present to the board as solid a management team as we\u2019re capable of doing. And we\u2019re going to be a management team that\u2019s going to step up to that responsibility and not side step it. The depth of the folks in this place around here it never fails to amaze me.", "The talent here is just remarkable. And my job particularly, is to make sure that those people get additional responsibility and additional exposure. And that when that time comes that it\u2019s very natural, there\u2019s nothing upsetting to the organization internally. There\u2019s nothing upsetting to the constituents externally, it\u2019s as it should be and that\u2019s really my goal. For I mean \u2013 I\u2019ll be 62 in November Brian I think is going to be 62 later this year. I think Jay Benet will be 62 in August, so we all \u2013 we\u2019re not Methuselah here, we\u2019re mere mortals and our time will come. And our job is to develop that next generation and present them and just have it not be a big deal.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Kumar with Macquarie; please proceed with your question.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "Thanks, and I\u2019m not 62 yet so. Just two quick follow-up questions. The first is, I guess it was Brian\u2019s question and you answered that. Jay you said retentions, you haven\u2019t seen it on its way up. And I\u2019m trying to sort of think about those and you\u2019re right, we should focus on retentions and rate adequacy if so many lines are at rate adequacy shouldn\u2019t that eventually start class stating [ph] into better retentions and eventual growth in premiums?", "Jay Fishman", "Complicated question. I think that retention, something [indiscernible] taught me many years ago, that the real emotional content behind retention is agent comfortable, market comfortable, customer comfortable, a terrific set of circumstances where everybody feels good and fair and equitable in the relationship. And that will encourage accounts to stay where they are. And that\u2019s a really good thing, it\u2019s good for the accounts by the way.", "We think tenure matters; we think it\u2019s a advantage, it\u2019s good for the agents. They can attend to things that they need to attend to and obviously it\u2019s good for the carriers that have the business. So the retention dynamic is, I think, really a reflection of the level of comfort of all of the parties to the transaction. And that\u2019s really good, that\u2019s a good thing. Dynamic of growth is a more challenging one. There\u2019s no green light that goes on that says, now we\u2019re interested in growing. Always interested in doing more business, always and when we can bring on new accounts and we have \u2013 we\u2019ve demonstrated this in slides in years gone by.", "Recognizing that there is a, the internal expression is a new business penalty, but recognizing that there\u2019s a new business penalty associated with it, if we can see a pathway to bringing on new accounts, and over time managing them to acceptable returns, we\u2019re going to go ahead and do that, there\u2019s nothing different about that this month than there was last month. And it\u2019s not as if we weren\u2019t booking new business a year-ago when rates weren\u2019t as attractive as they are now. We were, we were as aggressive as we could be. And if anything, I would say that \u2013 if we had any disappoint, is that we weren\u2019t actually doing more notwithstanding our encouragement.", "The thing to recognize is that, and again I\u2019ve said this before, I apologize for saying that so many times I don\u2019t want it to sound it as though we believe this because of this quarter and this is what we\u2019ve said. You\u2019re not going to grow your book by marginally changing your price attitude at the point of sale. First of all we don\u2019t have a price list. We don\u2019t have a price list; it\u2019s an individual underwriter sitting down with an agent talking about an individual account.", "So it\u2019s not as if we can say lower prices by 3% or 4%, it just isn\u2019t that precise. And so the way you, the way you grow is by perceiving opportunity, typically by risk selection, either categories of risk, lines of business geographies that you weren\u2019t in before that amount for any number of reasons, you perceive opportunity for us Canada, terrific opportunity, Brazil a terrific opportunity.", "We showed at Investor Day we\u2019ve grown our middle markets business. My recollection is like by 50% over eight or nine years from $2.1 billion to $3.2 billion in premiums. Now at the same time our construction surety business has shrunk pretty dramatically as a result of the environment we\u2019re in. And so you have to be \u2013 we\u2019re not in one market, we\u2019re 50 markets. And you have to be nimble enough to see the opportunities where they are and pursue them aggressively, but also be cautious enough to understand the risk presented in a changing set of circumstances and dial it back.", "So we\u2019ve been growing in the lines of business here significantly, and either because circumstances change or we made mistakes in some markets than we did, we, we shrunk others, so it\u2019s all in net but it is in that granular dynamic.", "Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie", "My apologies for the fire alarm, just very quickly is there a portion of your book which can be potentially structured into a sidecar or an alternative capital provider, thanks.", "Jay Fishman \u2013 I\u2019m reluctant to give a quick answer on something that, we haven\u2019t really thought about it, we haven\u2019t spent time contemplating it. I actually thought where you were heading was a portfolio transfer transaction, which we always think about, but I haven\u2019t thought about the sidecar dynamic and I\u2019d be reluctant to answer on the slide.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Thank you. I had a question about Dominion actually, if I remember right, that was a business where you guys bought it was operating around a 100 combined, and it looks like you\u2019ve really turned that around very quickly,, just curious kind of where\u2019s that business running now. And maybe you can just talk a little bit about what actions you\u2019ve taken in order to kind of to get yourself to that place, thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure Michael its Alan Schnitzer I\u2019ll handle that. I guess I would say, I would caution you from thinking that we\u2019ve turned it around that quickly there\u2019s certainly a lot integration work going on and we\u2019re still; we\u2019re still hard at work on that. So the improvement you\u2019re seeing I guess is your, you\u2019re looking at the results and seeing the combined ratio relative to what we guided you to and treating that to Dominion, that\u2019s actually not correct its mostly a reinsurance transaction and some large losses that were better than what we had in the \u201892. So it\u2019s actually not coming from the Dominion, but to get to your, to get to your question what are we doing?", "We\u2019re doing all the sorts of things you\u2019d think that, that a company like us would be doing. We\u2019re working hard with Greg Toczydlowski in personal insurance and the whole business insurance team to bring all the know-how and sophistication in data and analytics, some scale and synergy advantage, but really just taking the know-how we have resident here at Travelers\u2019 and exporting it to that platform. And we feel very good about the opportunity, as good as we did when we signed up the deal, but I can\u2019t tell you that it\u2019s all been reflected in this quarter.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "So then so the expense ratio benefit that we saw is primarily a result of the reinsurance, can you mention them?", "Alan Schnitzer", "No, no the expense benefit you saw does primarily come from the Dominion, but there is, there is a more than offsetting loss ratio deterioration from the Dominion. So on a net basis and an all win basis, loss and expense ratio, the Dominion is actually hurting, but it is helping on the expense ratio pretty significantly. And it\u2019s a loss ratio piece we think over that time, we\u2019ll be able to work through and bring to hurtle levels.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "That makes sense.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Thanks very much. First I\u2019ve been covering the company and industry for a long time. I think we all understand the spring storms tend to be a heavy seasonal CAT quarter. I think it will be helpful for folks to get a perspective on what you would normalize annual CAT load to be. If I look back over say the past dozen years, I think the average is between 4 and 5 combined ratio points. Is that a good starting point?", "Jay Fishman", "And Jay, just for clarification you were talking about in the second quarter.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Correct, I was talking about \u2013 say for the full year I think that gives a better perspective.", "Jay Benet", "Actually, this is Jay Benet, Jay, actually if you go to the proxy, there\u2019s a discussion about results and in it we do talk about what the expectation was for the CATs in the year versus where we ended up. And my recollection is the numbers about $550 after tax dollars. In dollars yes, so we\u2019re just having somebody open up the proxy and make sure we\u2019re right about that.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Okay thank you, I can generally take a look at that. On the next issue it would be in terms of capital return, I\u2019m wondering if we were to think about out years, could Travelers ultimately be in a position where dividends plus share buy backs could exceed in your operating earnings?", "Jay Benet", "Not permanently, it can obviously year-to-year. And that\u2019s really a function of timing, but the only way that it could actually exceed earnings permanently would be if we look today at the company. That\u2019s the only way to do it, so you know not permanently, no.", "Brian McLean", "Jay let me just jump back, it\u2019s Brian McLean, you started with we all kind of know spring storms and volatility and clearly we do, but when we look at our data of particularly what\u2019s happened with spring weather over the course of the last \u2013 well since 2008, it\u2019s dramatically higher than what you would have seen in the previous 20 years. To the extent of you know a 3X kind of number and in fact that\u2019s not even counting the 2011 off the charts number that we had.", "So we\u2019ve always known that we would have near term, short term volatility in our CAT numbers and everybody follows the industry, it\u2019s used to looking at that, but particularly for the second quarter tornado, hail activity and how our product is used to deal with that, we really have done a lot of thinking about what\u2019s the long term move to and whether we see continuing volatility in that number?", "Jay Fishman", "A good example anecdotal actually of the magnitude of the volatility, there was not two on the go, we didn\u2019t think about catastrophe loading auto, in personal auto. We do now and that\u2019s just the function of experience. So we\u2019re reacting to the changing weather patterns kind of almost on a real time basis. It\u2019s hard to answer the question at this point, of what a normal level is, that\u2019s why we talked about it so much over the last few years. There\u2019s been a driver of not only weight, but underwriting in terms of conditions; it\u2019s just proving to be a challenge.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Hi, good Morning. First question on the competitive environment, I think you\u2019ve done a good job explaining that it\u2019s largely unchanged. Jay, you mentioned that you think there is likely going to be a soft landing. Just curious sort of looking at the cycle versus the past, what\u2019s different and what gives you confidence that there is going to be a softer landing this time around?", "Jay Fishman", "Just because it\u2019s my opinion doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s so; I need to start off with that. It\u2019s just one persons point of view right, we\u2019ve been talking for years now about the fact that our view was that the magnitude of this cyclicality in our business, we thought would be lower than an historical experience. And it was driven by everything from much better data across the industry.", "I\u2019ll exclude myself, but I think much better management in the industry than wasn\u2019t the case 20 years ago. You look at capital deployment philosophies; it\u2019s different than it was 20 years ago. I think Sarbanes Oxley and the attention of audit committees and boards to adequacy of reserves to the level, the procedures and policies around reserve setting has made them much more accurate.", "It\u2019s not that people were abusing it before, it\u2019s that there\u2019s a whole different level of attention and focus on those initial picks, what\u2019s driving them, what are the factors for transparency that exists to what the governance committee, external auditors, internal auditors, boards, those are all things that will make the accounting and reserving process better. Never guarantee, we\u2019re all talking about the future but it will make it better and I think it has.", "And I think as a consequence of that, the feedback move between clean performance and underwriters and pricing decisions is stunningly faster than it was 20 years ago. We actually are at a point now where we\u2019re booking weather dynamics virtually month-to-month. When I first started here, you were lucky if you had it in the quarter, that\u2019s the level of feedback there was. So the delay in understanding what\u2019s trans-factoring it back into reserving and changing pricing, was much more attenuated than it is today, its crisp.", "And I\u2019ve listened to other companies and how they report, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re unique in that regard, I think \u2013 I listen to other companies and I\u2019m impressed by what I hear and the nature of controls and procedures and the thoughtfulness and I think is a consequence the magnitude \u2013 there\u2019ll always be some cyclicality here and there\u2019s cyclicality in every business. But I said, coming close to probably 8 or 9 years ago, I thought that the amplitude on the way up as well as the amplitude on the way down were going to be much more narrow.", "I think that was true obviously on the way up we will now see it on the way down. So that\u2019s what I think, and we\u2019ll find out, I think the leadership in this industry has come to understand that attempting to grow market share by marginally changing price, and actually creating share holder value from it is impossible. I think about it all the time, and I don\u2019t know how to do it and I\u2019m not sure anybody else does. And so we\u2019ve all learned within our own cultures and our own environment and our own strategies, how to manage our businesses to create shareholder value, that\u2019s what we\u2019re supposed to do.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Thank you and just a quick follow-up on the Quantum 2.0, I think you said that the results weren\u2019t what the expectations, just a little bit more color on that. You\u2019ve had 6 months, and so what do you think in terms of loss and what\u2019s your expectations thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019m going to turn it over to Greg in a second to talk about loss trend, but it would be remiss if I didn\u2019t observe, because I think he takes it for granted on this. We mentioned that the number of quoted policies is actually up 10%. That\u2019s one of the really wonderful surprises here, we thought going into this, that we were being quoted everywhere because of the comparative rating process. And it was not our going in expectation that by putting in a different model, that we would actually increase the number of quotes.", "And so what\u2019s been \u2013 that 10% is a big number and what\u2019s impressive about that, is the agent understanding and reaction of the Travelers product of Quantum 2 as a legitimate competitive product and they\u2019re embracing it in their quoting process. So that\u2019s where we loss trend, but we\u2019ve to some extent, taken for granted internally the increase in quotes but it\u2019s a substantive plus.", "Brian McLean", "Absolutely and I think that echoes about how we feel about loss performance, we\u2019re very encouraged when we saw that increase in quote flow that Jay talked about. Obviously our focus then shifts right to the margin about how we\u2019re feeling about the profitability in that business given that we\u2019ve just launched our three largest states last month. We\u2019re not up on our 1 year anniversary, obviously we don\u2019t have a credible set of earned premium yet to really declare a victory, but our focus is really looking at long-term surrogates of profit right now, including the mix of business, short-tail coverage\u2019s like the frequency on physical damage coverage and all of those things that we\u2019re looking at, they\u2019re right within expectation.", "So we\u2019ll continue to aggressively measure the ultimate combined ratio, but all those proxies that we look at are within expectations. So we\u2019re feeling as good about the quote flow that Jay talked about that we are with the early loss indicators.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Before we go to the next question, Jay Benet has a correction.", "Jay Benet", "It\u2019s a comment more than a correction. We said we would give you the number from the proxy as it relates to the quote, unquote normal CAT losses. And what we\u2019re remembering was actually from two years ago, the proxy from 2013 had $645 million as the after tax cost associated with CAT. So we had $550 before, and as I\u2019m reflecting on that, the thing I\u2019d want to share with you is really the fragility of these kinds of estimates, because looking at the $550 going to $650; it\u2019s not a reflection of increased exposure.", "It\u2019s really a reflection of trying to refine year-over-year what these CAT estimates are. And it\u2019s not all that long ago that if you ask the same question, we would have said something like $350 million after tax. And thinking back to those times, it\u2019s our exposure base was actually quite a lot larger than that. So this notion of \u2013 so while we\u2019re saying this is quote, unquote normal, I just want to highlight the fragility of the estimates.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Randy Binner with FBR Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Hi. Thank you. I have a couple on reserves and it\u2019s in the commercial area, you commented that asbestos environment led to kind of 08 to 12 releases. Can we infer just kind of from a normal claim closing pattern on general liability, that anything you\u2019d get 08 and prior in that area is kind of \u2013 you would have seen it by now?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet, when we\u2019re doing; we\u2019re dealing with reserves, by definition we\u2019re dealing with incomplete information. So we\u2019re looking at new information that\u2019s coming in every quarter and evaluating that with regard to whatever the assumptions have been. So I wouldn\u2019t look at any one of our reserves as being at finality. We\u2019re always looking at the flow of information and adjusting. There are times when you see some things; you\u2019re not sure whether you\u2019re going to react in full or in part to it. So I think it\u2019s the best I can do to answer your question.", "Randy Binner \u2013 FBR", "Okay. Yeah I mean I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of \u2013 because there\u2019s some PL and GL but it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not as long as like asbestos environmental, so I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of, if there really even is the potential for a lot more to come from 08 and prior?", "Jay Benet", "I mean our reserves are always a best estimate, so we don\u2019t really comment on whether they\u2019re going to change, we\u2019ll see what the data says going forward, there\u2019s always new information coming.", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019d just make an observation, asbestos and environmental is a general liability exposure. The difference there is that particularly in the asbestos arena, much of it came from a time when there were no policy aggregates, there were per occurrence aggregates that we started on a mid basis.", "I think we ended up with policy aggregate starting in the early 80s. So that was pre dated that, but liability is a policy that lasts forever, you can always have things \u2013 you just never know.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I guess question I had was on loss trend, you talk about a loss trend in business insurance of roughly around 4%. And I\u2019m wondering is that the number you\u2019ve priced for or is that what you are observing, because seemingly what you\u2019ve been pricing before for the past, you know five years. You\u2019ve seen something less than that given the reserve releases. So when you talk about that number what exactly are you referring to?", "Brian McLean", "Our actuaries, our finance, our business folks are always looking at what they think frequency and severities going to be and you know, building in you know various assumptions they take into account, what recent trends have been. There\u2019s always the question of gee, if you\u2019d seen \u2013 and make up an example, if you\u2019ve seen recent inflation running at 1% or whatever, what does that mean going forward? Is it going to continue at 1% or is it going to get better, is it going to get worse? So at a very granular level, we\u2019re making assumption everyday and pricing and reserving as to what the future has in store based on current events and past trends.", "And when you look at the kind of environment that we\u2019re faced with today, looking at very tame inflation, but some of the factors at work as to creating uncertainty as to what those inflation rates are going to be going forward. You have to take that into account and ultimately, that along with every other assumption comes down to a series of numbers for frequency and severity.", "And things have been running pretty moderately, but when we say there\u2019s a 4% trend factor and you go back in time, I think you\u2019re absolutely right in saying well maybe it was actually a little less severe than we had expected. So we had favorable development, but going forward, you have to make a determination as to whether that\u2019s going to continue or whether the world is going to change.", "Jay Fishman", "Right so specifically Jay, when we say this quarter 4% loss trend, we\u2019re talking about both what we\u2019re seeing is trend in the current year, and what we\u2019re pricing for. And obviously that\u2019s an aggregate number so it\u2019s all over the place by different lines. As we have prior year development, we\u2019re looking at why we had that development and does that change our outlook of what the current year should be?", "So an example of one which usually wouldn\u2019t would be if we had favorable development on prior year CAT, we\u2019d probably say that doesn\u2019t \u2013 unless they were dramatic, wouldn\u2019t fundamentally change our view of CAT\u2019s this year. There are other things that you could obviously say would change it. So the base year does move but, its \u2013", "Jay Benet", "Yeah and the most volatile part of it is non-CAT weather. Our loss trend numbers make an assumption about non-CAT weather and that\u2019s obviously, at least I think, the most unpredictable part of that loss trend dynamic, it is one of the reasons why you\u2019re hearing us relentlessly talk about upset by favorable non-CAT weather or upset by adverse non-CAT weather, it\u2019s just who knows.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "On that topic you talked about non-CAT weather relative to a year-ago being worse. Can you speak to non-CAT weather relative to a normal second quarter, was this worse than you might have expected normally, instead of just compared to last year versus the normal expectation.", "Jay Benet", "I\u2019ll take that and it\u2019s a little different BI to PI so in, in personal insurance we would say this quarter was the non-CAT weather was about normal. It was a couple of points worse than last year, which was abnormally low. In BI this quarter non-CAT weather was a little bit high, so about a point unfavorable to both last year, which was kind of normal and what we would have expected this year. And the difference there is especially when you get into tornado, hail the, the impacts in the commercial business can be really random and volatile.", "Personal lines you have a storm and it hits the neighborhood and we can kind of see the claims. In business insurance you can hit our risk or not hit our risk and it could dramatically change the number. So that\u2019s the perspective relative to kind of normal. PI about normal this quarter BI a little bit worse than normal.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. And this will be our last and final question.", "Operator", "And the last question comes from Josh Stirling with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "So we talked a lot about reserves. I was wondering if you could give us some color, I know it\u2019s the best estimate, but there\u2019s a range of different approaches across the industry. Some companies consistently target something like a zero favorable development targets on consistently target a much larger number.", "You guys, just from observation, seem to be sort of in the middle of the range, but everybody is thinking about earnings over the next few years, pricing slowing you think you\u2019re guiding in your \u2013 in your outlooks actually talk about how underwriting margins and the underlying basis seem to be slowing and stabilizing. I\u2019m wondering what we should be expecting you guys truly would like to be sort of a normal level of favorable development, when you think about sort of what\u2019s your real philosophy really. And through the cycle or look like, it\u2019d be really helpful for us?", "Brian McLean", "Looking at each other, Jay and I my own view is that our goal is to get it right. If we could pick the right number, and first of all, that\u2019s our responsibility, our obligation is to record a best estimate. So that\u2019s what we do, we attempt to record best estimate. And the accounting rules are critical, they\u2019re a really big deal, but it\u2019s also how you price and how you think about the returns in your business. And where you perceive risk versus rewards.", "So the importance of making it our best estimate is just critical.", "We struggle to figure out how to manage the business if we were recording something other than that, because we priced to that loss ratio, we priced to that trend, we priced to that yield curve, it\u2019s just critical for us. So I\u2019m sure Jay and I would say this but \u2013 give you the same answer, which is our expectation sitting here today, is that there won\u2019t be any development.", "We think we\u2019ve got it right, it doesn\u2019t mean that we don\u2019t have issues that we\u2019re watching and aware of and you\u2019ll ask us often about emerging trends and claims. We keep track of all that, but our goal is to get it right and so the notion of a question about a normal level of reserved development, just doesn\u2019t resonate with us. We don\u2019t think of it that way, we don\u2019t think there is a normal level of reserve development.", "Jay Benet", "And I fully agree with that. It\u2019s always about best estimates; it\u2019s always about getting it right. I just echo what Jay says.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s fine. And thank you but again, I just asked the question. This quarter seemed to slow a little bit, the competition was \u2013 I think you talked about some good guys and bad guys, I was very, was obviously a good news and then there were some environmental. Is there anything that we can infer from the lower PI favorable development and the lower personal lines favorable development that we should look at as a forward leading indicator or is the process still the same and should we look back over the average and make our own conclusions?", "Jay Benet", "Well we try to give you as much information as we can with regard to what the drivers of favorable development are. So in the case of PI, do you think about the first quarter, a lot of it dealt with weather related losses both CAT and non-CAT and we had some additional non-CAT weather related losses that turned out to be more favorable. And business insurance, you just mentioned of the level of favorable development was 25, but that was after the environmental.", "So if you just look at the numbers, you\u2019ve got a storyline that over the last many years has provided insight as to what are the drivers of it and we\u2019ll see just how those drivers, or others, manifest themselves moving forward, but I don\u2019t think there\u2019s more that we have to offer that relates to that. We try to be pretty transparent, very transparent.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good, that will conclude our calls today.

Ms. Nawi you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Julian. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2014 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and our webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section. Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; as well as Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond and Specialty Insurance.", "They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I\u2019d like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read the results this quarter were just terrific, as demonstrated by our operating returning on equity of 15.2%. In addition to posting very strong financial results, the underlying dynamics in our businesses are showing very solid performance and give us continued optimism about our future financial results.", "Starting with Personal Insurance, Quantum 2.0 is proving to be a real success. New auto business is a clean double from last year\u2019s third quarter and loss experience well still early is very much consistent with our original plans. Retention on our entire auto book remains high, on a sequential quarter basis total auto policies enforce increased for the first time since the second quarter of 2011 and we expect to see sequential policy growth again in the fourth quarter.", "Lastly and positively, we believe our homeowners business is actually showing some lift from Quantum auto. In our Business Insurance segment its business as usual. We continue to achieve rate gains were needed and we see no fundamental change in the competitive environment that is trends remain generally the same. Retention is actually up in almost all of the business units and we remain optimistic about our ability to continue to successfully execute our granular pricing strategy and achieve improving returns.", "In our Bond and Specialty Insurance business, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased we\u2019ve navigated through the financial crisis in the great recession as successfully as we have as evidenced by consistently strong results. This performance demonstrates the underwriting thoughtfulness and skill that are such a part of the fabric of our organization. And we\u2019re particularly proud of our investment department performance in a challenging environment they\u2019ve maintained their investment criteria and done the right things, another example of our discipline.", "Well it\u2019s always nice to post a strong quarter; I think it\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re committed to running this organization successfully over the long-term. This results that we posted this morning were driven by decisions made years ago that have been translated to successful marketplace strategies. Our long-term performance is really the result of [indiscernible] analysis, our commitment to analytics, insightful discipline applied to a risk taking business and to be candid a little bit of good fortune.", "Our energy is going to be committed to two things, first more of the same, first rate execution of thoughtful data drive strategies; second notwithstanding the more of the same approach, we are also committed to challenging our own conventional wisdoms to identify opportunities and making the decisions today that are necessary perhaps even critical to making sure that our financial performance remains top tier.", "In addition to hearing from Jay and Brian this morning, Alan and Doreen will provide the commentary on the performance of their business segments. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Jay. We were very pleased with our results this quarter with operating income per diluted share of $2.61 and an operating ROE of 15.2% driven by very strong underwriting and investment results. Underwriting results benefited from a slightly lower level of catastrophe losses this quarter, $83 million pretax is compared to $99 million pretax in the prior year quarter.", "In contrast to the lower level of cats, we incurred higher non-cat weather related losses this quarter, as compared to the prior year quarter, which more than offset the benefit of earned pricing increases that exceeded loss cost trends in each of our business segments and drove a slight 0.5 point uptick in our underlying combined ratio.", "Underwriting results also benefited from net favorable prior year reserve development of a $113 million pretax down from a $158 million pretax in the prior year quarter. Current quarter net favorable prior year reserve development included a $250 million pretax increase to our [indiscernible] reserves driven mostly by increases in the company\u2019s estimate of projected settlement and defense cost related to a broad number of policyholders due to a higher level of litigation activities surrounding mesothelioma claims than we\u2019ve previously anticipated.", "As well as a $77 million pretax increase in our ULAE reserves that the accrual of interest resulting from a recent court decision relating to the asbestos direct action litigation. On the positive side current quarter reserve development included a $64 million pretax benefit resulting from better than expected loss experience related to an old workers compensation reinsurance pool that we participated in along with another pretax benefit of $98 million that resulted from the final commutation of assumed and ceded reinsurance treaties associated with that pool.", "Current quarter reserve development also benefited from better than expected loss experience in GL, property and fidelity and surety in recent accident years. And year-to-date on a combined stat basis for all of our subs and excluding A&E, all accident years developed favorably.", "Overtime, we\u2019ve generated much more capital than what is needed to support our business. This has allowed us to return over $900 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, we pay dividend of a $186 million and repurchase $751 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date, we returned almost $2.9 billion of excess capital to our shareholders, with dividends of $553 million and common share repurchases of $2.3 billion.", "Shifting from the current year; let me provide a historical view of how our capital management strategy is performed over time. The Board of Directors initiated the current share repurchase program on May 2nd, 2006 a little over 8 years ago. On May 1st, 2006 the day before the board authorization Travelers market capital was $30.2 billion and we had approximately 696 million shares outstanding. Since that time, we\u2019ve repurchased over 416 million shares at an average price of $56.50 per share issued a net amount of approximately 51 million shares mostly in connection with share-based incentive comp awards, and now have 331 million shares outstanding at the end of the current quarter, a 52% reduction in our common shares.", "And if you add in the dividends that we paid during this time period, we\u2019ve returned approximately 98% of our May 1, 2006 market cap to our shareholders. We accomplish this all throughout this period while maintaining capital and support of strategic business opportunities such as those in Brazil and Canada, very strong holding company liquidity and modest debt levels.", "Notably our ratings increased during this time period from already very high levels to industry leading levels. And even after returning all of this capital to our shareholders, our market cap stands at $31.6 billion today.", "Operating cash flows of over a $1.8 billion we\u2019re extremely strong this quarter bringing total operating cash flows almost $3.2 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $1.9 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Our debt-to-total capital ratio of 21.3% was lower than its target range and during the quarter book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses increased 2%, while year-to-date book value per share increased 9% and adjusted book value per share increased 6%.", "Finally net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.9 billion at the end of the third quarter as compared to $2 billion at the beginning of the year.", "With that, let me turn things over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Before Alan and Doreen go over the segment results, I would like to give some perspective on how we view the overall market. And to do that, I will start with returns. We are a return-focused company and, as such, we are pleased with our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date. We are especially pleased that we were able to deliver these results and what continues to be a very challenging investment environment, one where 10-year Treasury yields continue to hover between 2% and 2.5%. When we look at our returns below this aggregate level, we are also encouraged.", "To understand our product profitability, we look at accident year returns at the line level; and at this more detailed level, we are very pleased both with the improvement that we have seen over the last several years and with the absolute level that those returns are at today. There are obviously differences line by line, but overall we continue to see signs of a rational marketplace. Doreen and Alan will go through the segment production statistics, but as we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful in executing our pricing strategy, which is to retain a high percentage of our best business, improve profitability where needed, and write new business that meets our target returns.", "I don\u2019t have a crystal ball and I am not predicting the future, but based on what we see today there is nothing in the market that would cause our ability to continue to execute on this pricing strategy to be meaningfully changed.", "We are also encouraged that as overall returns have become more consistent with our long-term objective, we have begun to see improving top line trends. We have said many times that volume is never our goal, but that we always seek opportunities to add business that meets our target returns. We have seen improved retention across most of the businesses and higher new business volume in many of them, and we believe that these trends are the result of our strategic focus on delivering meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages in the markets we serve. So overall through the first 9 months of 2014, fairly stable market conditions and very strong underwriting results.", "And with that, I will turn it over to Alan.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Brian, and good morning.", "In Business and International Insurance, third quarter operating income was $552 million. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior-year reserve development, was 94.9 for the quarter, up 1.7 points over the prior year. The 1.7-point change resulted from an increase of 2 points, largely from non-cat weather in both our domestic and international businesses, as well as the impact of the inclusion of The Dominion, partially offset by the favorable impact of about 1 point from earned price exceeding lost trend. We also saw a modest uptick in our expense ratio, mostly attributable to a favorable item in 2013.", "Turning to production trends for domestic BI, compared to the second quarter, overall retention was up about 1 point and total renewal premium change was up slightly as the increasing exposure more than offset a lower level of positive rate change. Year-over-year, new business was about flat.", "In Select, we were pleased to see an improvement in retention to just over 80%, with total renewal premium change of nearly 9%. We wrote $92 million of new business, representing a 5% increase over the same period last year. In middle market, as a greater percentage of the business has achieved attractive returns, we have increased our focus on keeping the better -performing accounts.", "Accordingly, we were pleased to have achieved a 2-point increase in retention to a very strong 85% with positive rate change declining less than 0.5 point, and each case is compared to the most recent quarter.", "Lastly, new business of $236 million for the quarter grew by nearly 10% as compared to the same period last year. Overall, we feel very good about the production results; but as you\u2019ve heard from us many times in recent quarters, the aggregate numbers don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and which accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our production strategy.", "In our middle-market businesses, the data beneath these exhibits shows that on our best-performing business our retention has improved to around 90% and we continue to achieve slightly positive rate increases. On our poorest-performing accounts we are achieving low double-digit rate increases with meaningfully lower retention. These results are consistent with our marketplace strategy.", "Looking at production results for our International business, retention remains strong. Renewal premium change was down somewhat from recent quarters due primarily to lower rate and exposures in Lloyd\u2019s; and new business was up from the prior year due to the acquisition of The Dominion.", "Before I turn it over to Doreen, I would like to make an observation about margins. Many industry observers seem to focus overly so, in our view on the relationship between written rate change and lost trend. Particularly with rate change for the quarter of 3.3 points, dipping just below our current estimate of loss trend, which is about 4 points in the aggregate, I would like to point out that underwriting margins are impacted by a number of other factors including changes in exposure, underwriting actions, business mix, the impact of new business, weather, and so on.", "So particularly with written rate and loss trend in such a narrow band, we\u2019d caution you against drawing conclusions about the outlook for underwriting margins based solely on those measures.", "To wrap it up, I am pleased with our strong results for the quarter. And in terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Thank you, Alan. I would like to begin by saying how excited I am to again work with Tom Kunkel and his leadership team in managing our market-leading Bond & Specialty Insurance business. Also, I am really proud of the progress we\u2019ve made in Personal Insurance and look forward to continuing to work with Greg Toczydlowski and his team.", "Now for the results. In the Bond & Specialty Insurance segment, operating income of $165 million was 38% higher than the prior-year quarter. The increase was driven by higher levels of favorable prior-year reserve development, along with improved underlying underwriting margin. The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 81.7%, a 4-point improvement from the prior year, primarily due to exiting our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty as well as earned pricing in excess of loss cost trend across the segment.", "Net written premium for the quarter was $556 million, an increase of 1% compared to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent periods in the prior year, while new business of $34 million was down slightly from recent periods. Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits written, liability attachment points, and policy duration, was 4.6% for the quarter, up somewhat from the second quarter.", "In sum, strong profitability through Bond & Specialty\u2019s continued underwriting discipline and market leadership.", "Turning to Personal Insurance, operating income of $239 million for the quarter was down 9% compared to the third quarter of 2013, driven by lower favorable prior-year reserve development in Homeowners. The underlying combined ratio was 84% in the quarter, an improvement from 2013 of more than 1 point, primarily due to the benefits of earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, our previously announced expense-reduction initiative, and lower Homeowners commissions, partially offset by a higher mix of new business.", "As it relates to our expense reduction, to-date we have executed on initiatives responsible for about 90% of the $140 million run-rate savings target. As we have mentioned in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. We remain on track to achieve the full run-rate savings by the end of this year, in line with our original expectation.", "Looking at agency Auto, retention remained strong at 82%, while renewal premium change was about 6%. We also are extremely pleased with the progress we have made on new business production, driven by the impact that Quantum Auto 2.0 is having. New business premium of $166 million is more than double the third quarter of 2013, with 90% of the $166 million coming from Quantum 2.0. This increase in new business drove a year-over-year increase in net written premium of 3%. And, as Jay noted, policies in force increased from the most recent quarter for the first time since the second quarter of 2011.", "As for the rollout, Quantum 2.0 is now live in all but a handful of prior Quantum states; and our expectation is that these remaining states will go live over the next quarter or two.", "Turning to agency Auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio of 96.1% for the quarter was an improvement of 1.5 points over the prior year, driven primarily by the expense initiatives and earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trends, partially offset by the impact from higher new business volume. Our current view of overall Auto loss cost trend is about 3%, a slight improvement from what we communicated in recent quarters driven by some moderation in bodily injury severity and looking at the improvements in revenue and profitability, we believe our fundamental changes have made our auto product more competitive.", "Looking at agency homeowners and others production was strong in the quarter with renewal premium change of about 6%, while retention remained at 84%. New business volume of $95 million was up about 30% from the prior year quarter, due to some lift from higher volumes in Quantum 2.0 overall home production is in line with our expectation.", "From the profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 70.1% was an improvement of 1.5 over the third quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing that exceeded loss cost trend as well as lower expenses. So overall in personal insurance a great quarter with both strong financial results and production metrics and we remain pleased with the results of the Quantum 2.0 overall so far.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Julian, we\u2019re now ready for the Q&A portion. I would ask participants to please limit yourself to one question and one follow up.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Your line is now open; please proceed with your question.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you. I want to touch base on exposure growth in business insurance. It appears to be accelerating in the middle market, commercial business and select is showing more stable growth. Can you talk about the differences that are driving that?", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, the difference in middle market versus select?", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Yes, in terms of \u2013 the rate of change in exposure growth being stronger in middle market than select?", "Jay Fishman", "Yes, the exposure in fact really isn\u2019t from sales and payroll, its \u2013 and if you look at, look at the starting and ending point, you\u2019re probably looking at the webcast. If you look at the starting and ending points, it\u2019s actually a pretty straight line from those two end points. The way we calculate the number, the impact of audit premium creates a different quarter to after we report exposures in particularly in the middle market. And so, we would expect that to develop over time into more of a straight line.", "Brian MacLean", "I think \u2013 this is Brian; the other point on select, lot of that exposure growth is values on the property component of C&P.", "Jay Fishman", "And that\u2019s been an affirmative effort on our part to try to improve the values.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. So any other underlying difference in terms of exposure growth on the small business versus middle market?", "Jay Fishman", "No there isn\u2019t really, other than on the small side we\u2019ve really been working on the \u2013 the insurance to values and in middle market it really is a function of how we account for the audit premium in the exposures.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Okay. And then I had a separate question on capital return, so year-to-date if my math is right, share buybacks plus dividends are $2.9 billion, operating income $2.6 billion, so clearly capital return running well ahead of operating income on the order around 110%. Can you give and you had a prior comment also saying that there is a continued level of excess capital being generated. I don\u2019t know if you would care to update us on the capital management strategy in terms of could that that gap between capital return on operating income continue to grow over time similar to what we\u2019ve seen this year?", "Jay Benet", "Hi Jay, this is Jay Benet. Thanks for asking that question. What you\u2019re really seeing is a timing difference in the generation of the excess capital versus the timeframe in what is purchased, its repurchased. So and we look at, particularly year like 2014, one of the things you have to take into account is, how did the end of 2013 come out and it was a very strong fourth quarter and we did our year end capital calculations, we found that we had some excess capital that we carried into this year.", "So, we\u2019re playing a little bit of catch up now, but there is no change in strategy, there is no change in execution. It really goes back to the words that we used to describe, the program which is, we\u2019re generating it over time primarily through income and maintaining the capital we need to support our businesses. So that the ratings are maintained and the posture of the balance sheet doesn\u2019t change. And then to the extent, we have the excess capital that\u2019s getting generating we\u2019re buying that over time. But it\u2019s really, it\u2019s really driven by earnings. And you have to look at it, more broadly than just a nine month period.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Okay, so based on that we should still generally think about buybacks and dividends being roughly equal to annual operating earnings?", "Jay Benet", "I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s roughly equal, in our 10-Q and 10-K we talk about having enough capital to support the growth in the business, occasionally we make pension contributions to a qualified pension plan, so there are other things that will utilize capital in the place. But, the creation of capital is from the earnings.", "Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Great thanks, just a couple of question, in terms of the auto business. We\u2019re trying to figure out, you talked about 6% rate increases and we\u2019re trying to square that with the rate declines that you\u2019ve taken and talked about taking on the Quantum business that you\u2019ve repriced. Can you help sort of square those two things?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Michael, this is Doreen. Are you looking at the webcast with renewal premiums change?", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Yes.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "It would be and also our existing book on the renewal book of business.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Okay. So, for a business that you are Quantum is for new business only, is that so that\u2019s your, okay.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Quantum 2.0 is for new business only.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay that makes sense. And then, one question on just on business insurance, kind of looking at the margins there and what is, how much of an impact the year-over-year comparison does Dominion having if at all? And how should we think about, I trying to \u2013 I know you mentioned some non-cat weather but, just trying to parse out sort of rate versus loss trend in underlying margin? Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Hi its Alan Schnitzer. On the Dominion as we get \u2013 as we get sort of year end post close we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to breakout the impact of that in particular. I will tell you that at least in the current period it\u2019s, leaving out the unusual weather that we\u2019ve had in Canada, the hailstorm in Alberta and floods in Toronto. But leaving that out the Dominion was probably about a half a point on the loss ratio a couple tens on the expense ratio. But, we\u2019d really like to move away from quantifying the impacts of that transaction, just gets harder and harder to do as we enter there.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Sorry and its Gabi, just to be clear that\u2019s because it wasn\u2019t in the prior quarter, he is not setting a level of Dominion.", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s right.", "Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs", "Got it, okay. Okay, thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Good morning and thanks for taking my call. Just on the margin, just to follow on that, is that you mentioned some non-cat largely like a weather related losses. Is that how much, if you can quantify that in terms of how much that to track on the 50 basis point deterioration year-over-year and also is that a pattern where I have seen in the past few quarters, because I guess your peers reported some sort of non-cat large losses in past few quarters as well?", "Jay Fishman", "We\u2019ve been observing for a couple of years with that the weather seems to be getting more extreme and so this is \u2013 is, consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing over couple of years in quarter weather was worth something like a point and a half on the delta.", "Jay Benet", "Its Jay Benet, I would add to that, when you\u2019re asking are there trends involved, we are always going to have quarter-over-quarter differences associated with things like non-cat weather or large losses, what we\u2019re trying to do is point that out to give you some insight into what\u2019s taking place. But, I wouldn\u2019t say that in all cases when we say the weather is higher it means the weather was terrible, I mean it\u2019s just higher than it was last year. So, I wouldn\u2019t call this a really bad weather quarter, but last year\u2019s third quarter was actually a little on the favorable side.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "That\u2019s great. My second question is on the reinsurance side. Just given what\u2019s happening in the marketplace in reinsurance, basic pricing coming down, various alternative solutions, and just wonder what is your overall reinsurance strategy. Are you thinking about setting up some alternative structure, including internal or captive reinsurers?", "Jay Fishman", "Hi, it\u2019s Jay Fishman. We are certainly looking at everything. There\u2019s obviously a lot of activity in that space. We are not a big utilizer of reinsurance, broadly speaking. When you look at the amount of ceded premium that we put out to the marketplace, it really isn\u2019t enough to jump through a lot of hoops and incur a lot of cost to create something that looks snappy but doesn\u2019t really accomplish much financially.", "So that doesn\u2019t mean we are giving up. I am mindful of the fact that it is getting a tremendous amount of attention, so I have actually been spending some of my own time in making sure I can actually understand it and make sense of it. So far, without a lot of effect, to be completely blunt with you; but we will obviously keep looking. I don\u2019t anticipate for us \u2013 not to say that somebody else. I don\u2019t anticipate that the change in reinsurance pricing in any broad measure will have a meaningful impact on us. Again, not because \u2013 for example, our property cat treaty wasn\u2019t less expensive; it was. But it is just not enough on a premium base of our size to make a substantial difference.", "I have also been asked whether we would be interested in building a book of business and in effect arbitraging it against the reinsurance opportunity. And I am always mindful that when you take on a risk on the right side of your balance sheet, there is some permanence to it; and the reinsurance profile on the left may or may not be permanent. And you\u2019ve got to be very cautious and careful about not finding yourself in an unreinsured position or in a mismatch, which can happen and has happened. I think back to September 11 and what a bunch of reinsurers did shortly in the days thereafter; and lots of us found ourselves with primary exposure without underlying reinsurance to cover. So there is a lot of moving parts here, and we are sure looking at it pretty hard. But so far I would say nothing that really excites me at least a great deal.", "Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Thank you so much for the answers.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Michael, let me just clarify, just so we pull these two questions together and don\u2019t leave any confusion here. What we said was there was about a 2-point increase in the combined ratio due to both weather and The Dominion. That was 2 points all in; about 1.5 point of that is weather and about 0.5 point of it is Dominion.", "Jay Fishman", "And again, just speak to direction, please.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Increase.", "Jay Fishman", "An increase of 1.5 point due to weather and an increase of 0.5 point due to Dominion.", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s right.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Hi. Good morning. The first question is on pricing and loss cost trends. I believe you said not to focus too much on pricing being up at about 3.3% and loss cost trend at about 4%. But just thinking about it at a 50,000-foot level, should we expect a small amount of margin compression next year and also, looking at the loss cost trends, if you could help us understand. I mean peers are looking at loss cost trend in the 2% to 3% range; your 4% number seems a little bit high. Just wondering if there is some amount of conservatism in that.", "Jay Fishman", "Well, I think perhaps we will split the question between myself and Alan. First, the reason that we are just cautioning against evaluating 3.3% versus 4% is that that arithmetic is pretty easy to do, but doesn\u2019t take into account all of the factors that affect the profitability of our business. We have reminded people frequently that a not insignificant amount of exposure base \u2013 particularly, for example, in our small commercial business, will act as an increase in rate absent a change in loss profile.", "As an example, to the extent we collect more premium due to inflation adjustments on property, unless the loss exceeds what would have been the previous total insured value level, that increase in exposure functions exactly the same as rate. And so it is easy to talk about a widening margin and I am going to make up numbers here. It\u2019s easy to talk about it when you\u2019ve got, to make up a number, 7% rate and 4% loss trend. And I suspect it would be easy if we were talking about 1% rate and 3% loss trend.", "But in and around the number, it is just not that precise to conclude that within 7/10 of a point that margins will necessarily contract or not contract. Candidly, I am not \u2013 our 10-Q is going to say in Business Insurance or does; I don\u2019t know if we filed it this morning; we did file it \u2013 says that we anticipate margins to be flat, equivalent, in Business Insurance into 2015. And that is our best judgment at the moment.", "It\u2019s what\u2019s funny, people seem to think that there is a stunning amount of difference between talking about plus 0.2 versus minus 0.2, but they understand that there is no big difference between plus 2.2 and plus 1.8. It is the same 4/10; it just happens to be around a different baseline number. So our caution is simply to let you know that notwithstanding all of our analytical skill and insight into the numbers, this is getting pretty precise to make arithmetic calculations based on these numbers. We just caution against it.", "Alan Schnitzer", "On the second question on loss trend, hard for us to comment on anybody else\u2019s loss trend. But I would suggest you might want to look at mix.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Just as a follow-up, the Homeowners commission expense ratio was low. I was just curious to why that was. Thanks.", "Jay Fishman", "Can you repeat the question please?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I couldn\u2019t hear it. I\u2019m sorry.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Sorry. On the Homeowners, I believe the commission expense ratio was lower this year versus last year. I was just curious why.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "We did reduce the Homeowners commission rates. Yes; we implemented those in probably the middle of 2013, maybe a little bit earlier than that.", "Brian MacLean", "And some of the expense initiatives we had from \u2013 relative to Quantum was also impacting Homeowners.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Well the \u2013 yes, exactly. So about 25% of our expense reductions fell to the Homeowners line.", "Jay Fishman", "But the Homeowners commission expense number fell because of a change in the rate that we pay on Homeowners business. We implemented that, again, in the middle of 2013. That is the driving factor there.", "Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yes, just a couple of questions. I guess maybe the first quick one for Doreen. You had mentioned, I think it was the Specialty and professional liability business that you had changed your reinsurance session there, and that helped earnings. Can you talk a little bit more about that?", "And then separately, asbestos. Surprised no one has asked you yet about it, but another very sizable charge. Can you talk about really what you are seeing there now? It just feels as if this is an annual sizable charge, and you\u2019re almost going on a pay-as-you-go basis, and we should almost expect this kind of charge going forward. I am wondering if you can give more insight into the asbestos.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "This is Doreen. I will talk first about the Bond & Specialty Insurance reinsurance treaty, and then I will turn it over to Jay Benet for asbestos. But as I think we reported in the past, the decision was made to exit from our management liability excess-of-loss reinsurance treaty; and that decision was made at the end of 2013. And essentially what you are seeing is that, as we looked at our book of business both from a limit standpoint, the quality of the underwriting, we just felt like the ceded premium didn\u2019t make sense given the performance of the book. And so if you were to look at the underlying combined ratio being up about 4 points, it is about 3 of that underlying improvement. And it is really just looking at what premium you wanted to pay for your loss content. So a great decision was made, and we see it in the results.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Doreen.", "Jay Benet", "Hi, Jay; it\u2019s Jay. As it relates to asbestos, as you know we follow this very closely every quarter and we supplement the quarterly procedures with, what we refer to is the, very in-depth claim study that gets done annually and we\u2019ve completing it in the third quarter. So what\u2019s going on with the data, first of all every time we, put an asbestos reserve it\u2019s our best asbestos of what the totality of losses will be and as you know there are pages and pages in our 10-K and 10-Q describing all the uncertainties associated with asbestos and what\u2019s taking place, we\u2019re not taking place in the environment.", "So in terms of the overall environment, I\u2019d remind everybody that, we\u2019ve had the asbestos exclusion in our policies for decades at this point, the product is in use the way it, its formally used decades ago. And the assumptions that we\u2019ve build in to the reserves are that there will be tailing off claims over time based on the ageing population and all the other dynamics to go along with that. So, we are making these estimates and then, periodically looking to see are the estimates holding up in terms of the data that\u2019s emerging.", "And what\u2019s been happening in the last couple of years and we can come up with anecdotes to perhaps why it\u2019s happening, but what keeps happening over time is that our estimates which are the best estimates of the point in time are proving to a little short as new information emerges. And in talking to our claim people who deal at this and, asking the ageing question, why doesn\u2019t this stuff drop off at the rate that we had expected, some of the anecdotal answers tend to be and I underscore anecdotal that well perhaps we have a situation where, years ago given where, general medicine was at that point, people were dying of different things like heart attacks or forms of cancers and with medical advances, perhaps living longer and by living longer and not buying of those particular diseases, mesothelioma might develop and, suddenly now you have an asbestos claim.", "So, part of this is, the estimation process, part of this is just, trying to understand the trends that are going on, but I welcome the day when we can all watch a sporting event and not to see a point of certainty, adds you know saying if you ever heard the word mesothelioma call this number. But that\u2019s the environment, but I will say that there isn\u2019t a fundamental change in the environment that it\u2019s not new theories or anything like that its more matter of trying to estimate, what\u2019s actually out there. I hope that was helpful.", "Jay Cohen \u2013 Merrill Lynch", "Yes that was helpful Jay, thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital", "Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I respect that you don\u2019t want to get into too much detail on Dominion, but given the fourth quarter will be the first where we\u2019re on an apples-to-apples basis it would be helpful to just know what Dominion is growing at organically and I think when you did the deal, you expected it to be modestly accretive to 2014 and I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s coming to fruition?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Larry it Alan, I\u2019m just trying to process the questions here. In terms of, on Dominion I should just take a step back and say that we\u2019re very pleased with the transaction the integration is going very well, they are very pleased with the local team in Canada and the way the two teams are integrating and very pleased with the way that the both teams in Canada and our U.S. businesses are integrating. So, I should really start off and I think this is the important message about the Dominion its going very well, there is no surprises and we\u2019re enthusiastic about the deal today as we were and we signed.", "Jay Benet", "And let me just add in, because it\u2019s a great time to do it. I\u2019m not insignificant a portion of the rationale here was to export and make available in the Canadian marketplace, product and expertise that we had here in the U.S. that had not been developed up in Canada that is still very much the plan. So we are at the early days here, we\u2019re very much at the early days, I\u2019m sorry but that was helpful.", "Jay Fishman", "Larry in terms of your specific questions, I think we\u2019d really prefer on a business\u2019s size probably not to go down to that level of detail other than to say it\u2019s on track there is, whenever you do a deal of this size there is always some surprises that are a little bit good and a little bit bad that all of those are within the range of expectations and we\u2019re very, very pleased with the transaction.", "Larry Greenberg \u2013 Janney Capital", "Okay, fair enough.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Al Copersino from Columbia Management. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.", "Al Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management", "Thanks very much. I was wondering if you all had available or were willing to share for the bond and specialty segment and for the personal segment. We have the renewal premium change in the slide deck, I was curious if you are able to give us the rate changes specifically?", "Jay Benet", "It operates on \u2013 Brian and I will chat here, but those businesses in particular, it\u2019s really quite difficult to parse the rate change and renewal premium change, because they operate so much together. For example the policy limits right so, if you got an inflation element in the underlying property for example that\u2019s going to well shift premium, but that happens in many cases in effect automatically. So we don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t track rate and renewal premium change at the granular level that we can in other businesses to provide that breakout. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s not an appropriate question, it\u2019s with the business dynamics under it operate differently. And therefore really can\u2019t be parsed with quite as much precision.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "And this is Doreen. We do look at it to Jay\u2019s point, but we find the combination of them with renewal premium change to be the more meaningful way to look at the business. And we\u2019d never really disclose that level. So we can look at it, but we just don\u2019t want to make sure\u2026", "Jay Benet", "In most, yes in most cases in our personal lines of business, the fundamental exposure is not changing and it is the total price change that is really reflective. And Doreen you could talk about the Bond.", "Brian MacLean", "You can get, you get changes, but we just don\u2019t parse at that level.", "Jay Benet", "Bond?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "On the Bond side, I would say and we\u2019ve talked a little bit about the in management liability in particular on RPC and rate such as again the Jay\u2019s point of combined concept of what the limits are the attachment point, the term of the policy so we look at them blended together. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t look at them or we just its more meaningful to combine them for us for the business performance.", "Al Copersino \u2013 Columbia Management", "Okay, well thank you all. I appreciate it.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields of KBW. Your line is now open, please proceed with your question.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "Okay great, thanks. Good morning. Doreen, as there been any change in the competitive environment for personal lines specifically auto over the course of the year?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "What we\u2019ve seen and we\u2019ve watched this pretty closely to see particularly with our commission changes and Quantum 2.0, what\u2019s going on out there. And I would say in the independent agency channel, we\u2019ve seen some very targeted but, not broad follows in terms of a little bit of people changing commission, a little bit of targeting specifically on price reductions. What we haven\u2019t seen in that channel is anybody really address broadly the cost structure. And so, no it\u2019s not a major change, we just continue to watch it.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "Okay, that good news. Jay you talked earlier about the other factors that can drive margin improvement aside from the gap between rate increases and lost cost trends. I was wondering are those other issues is that expected trends changes it all?", "Jay Fishman", "Meyer I don\u2019t, is that \u2013 is that expected trend changing it all, help me, I don\u2019t understand quite the question.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "I\u2019m asking it for the, if the impact of other factors besides the rate loss trend gap and its impact on margin expansion, is that given the improvements you\u2019ve had so far for example in the granularity of pricing and so on should we expect less margin expansion from those other factors going forward that we have for the last couple of years?", "Jay Fishman", "I got it. The answer is, I sure don\u2019t think so. The reason for the caution is simply because it would be, I think, inappropriate to leap to a conclusion that 4% versus 3.3% will, in effect by definition, result in a narrowing margin. It may; I am not saying it\u2019s not. But there are other factors that go into whether the margin gets bigger or smaller, and you are in the range now of the gap between these two numbers that is, loss trend and rate to be such that these other factors, which always operate, they always operate, could actually produce a different outcome than the simple arithmetic would demonstrate.", "And again, the example I used before, with a rate of 7% and loss trend of 4%, this is just a loss treat of only [indiscernible]. It is an easy call. And with loss trend of 4% and rate of 1%, it would also be an easy call. But you are at a range now where it is not an easy call. I am not saying from the outside looking in, by the way; I am saying even from the inside it is not an easy call to absolutely say it is going to expand or it is going to contract. It is on the line, in effect, right now, and we don\u2019t know how to be any more precise than we are being with you. This is as good as we have to offer.", "Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW", "Okay. I understand. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners", "Good morning. Thank you and congratulations on the quarter. Just recently I was doing an agent tour, and they were talking about a little bit more aggressiveness in the spread between new business and old \u2013 and renewal business on the commercial business. I wanted to see if you perceived any change there in that, either in Travelers or in the marketplace.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Hey, Paul, it\u2019s Alan. Let me comment on us; and I am not sure we are going to comment more broadly on the market. But it\u2019s always dangerous, I think, to take one conversation with an agent and extrapolate from that. I would say from our data we see that over the last couple of years, seven or eight quarters, there has been a pretty consistent gap between new and renewal. But if you look back over a longer period of time, I would say that gap is reasonably tight at the moment on a longer-term view.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners", "Then as a separate question, it has been a long time since we have talked about some of the direct channels and other experimentation that you have been working on over several years. I would like to know if Quantum 2 is sort of where we are at with respect to what we are looking at for the future of Travelers for the next couple years, or if there are some ongoing efforts still to build out other channels.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "This is Doreen; I will just speak to that. So I will tell you that Quantum 2 is definitely a positive for direct-to-consumer as well as the agency channel. It was a product that we thought would be attractive across channels. So as we look at our metrics around conversion and sales, we believe that Quantum 2 has definitely had a positive in that.", "In addition to that, we always look for process improvements. We have also been very focused on looking at digital marketing and how to use our dollars in a very targeted way for direct. We also have plans, and I think we have talked to all of you in the past. This is not just direct, but we will continue to look at where we can enhance the property products as well as looking at how we bring accounts together; and that will be both a benefit for the agency channel as well as direct.", "Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners", "Great. Thanks for the answers.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. And this is our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Your line is now open. Please proceed with your question.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Hi, good morning, and thank you. Congratulations on a great quarter and thanks for fitting me in. So Jay, pricing has been slowing. It\u2019s come off, what, 3% in the past year; and if you simplistically project forward another year, at last year\u2019s pace pricing probably would be zero or maybe even a slight decline. And so I think big picture, we are all just trying to figure out whether the industry\u2019s pricing decline is going to stop at something like inflation. Does it go to zero, or does it go negative?", "I recognize you guys don\u2019t want to talk about other companies. But to keep it focused on Travelers, if I understand all the back and forth around the margin outlook and Alan\u2019s comments, I think you\u2019re basically saying that you will keep pricing more or less in line with inflation over the next year or so. Is that right?", "Jay Fishman", "Well, I can certainly tell you what our strategy is. I have no problem sharing that. And obviously, the ability to execute in a business environment \u2013 we may succeed; we may not. We haven\u2019t changed anything about the way we are approaching individual accounts. I remind everybody of this all the time. Right now there is an underwriter in Kansas City, right now, who is sitting with an agent having a conversation about one account. And they are not thinking about the overall market; they are not thinking about inflation. They are thinking about the return on that account and how do I improve it.", "So you\u2019ve got to start with the premise that this really does start at the bottom and work its way up. As accounts have become \u2013 as increasing number of accounts have now had several years of increases and are now producing profitability, returns, however, you like to look at it, that really fall into the boy, we are glad we have that account category, we ask our people to be thoughtful, to be judicious about the way they approach every individual account. It doesn\u2019t have to be a straight line. It can be a stair step. It can be driven by the local market. It can be driven by the relationship with an agent. It can be driven by the size of the book that we have with the agent. It can be driven by whether there has been claim problems or not on that account. All of those things go into the pricing of an individual account.", "Now, what we are trying to get to is a point where over time \u2013 we come back to over time all the time that we manage to offset the impact of loss cost by either rising prices or self-help through efficiency or expense reduction. And I point to the kinds of things that Greg Toczydlowski and the group have done in Personal Insurance. That dollar saved in expense is as good as a dollar raised at the point-of-sale in rate, in fact, arguably even better.", "And now I will speak really just personally, because I am not sure I am speaking for the whole place. I am hopeful, maybe even cautiously optimistic, that we will not \u2013 and I said this by the way 10 years ago \u2013 maybe not 10, maybe 8 years ago. I personally believe that the property and casualty business will have a meaningfully lower level of cyclicality. Never said zero, but always said a less, lower amplitude of that cyclicality. There are a host of reasons why I believe that. Analytics and data are just one, but a very important one.", "And I think it has proven on the way down before we entered into this cycle. I think it has been proven here on the way up. I am hopeful, maybe even optimistic, that that will turn out to be true on the way down. We don\u2019t see anything in the way in which business is done at the point of sale in the market that would suggest that we are at a precipice, that would suggest that something fundamentally is going to change next month, next quarter, or frankly even next year.", "Now, we could be dead wrong about all this; it\u2019s possible we could be dead wrong. But we are focused on over time maintaining our margins. It doesn\u2019t mean that an individual account has to have a price increase every year. It doesn\u2019t mean that in a quarter the rate won\u2019t come under loss trend. I would like to know where the mix of business is that is coming up for renewal. The answer to success for us is in the granular analysis more than the headline numbers.", "So that\u2019s honestly how \u2013 we\u2019re never anything but honest \u2013 but that is how we see the marketplace environment. That is how we intend to operate. We will see if it sustainable. Again, I am hopeful and maybe even optimistic. There is a thoughtfulness. We understand \u2013 but we are not unique in this \u2013 we certainly understand the world of risk-taking. I have a lot of respect for a lot of other companies out there because I see how they operate, and they also have a great respect for risk-taking.", "And that I think is kind of different than it was perhaps 15 years ago. There is a different level I think of understanding and perception of what it means to commit your shareholders\u2019 capital to a risk or a series of risks and turn out to be dead wrong. And I think there is a healthy regard for that, and that has resulted in a set of industry-wide better analytics, better risk-taking profile that I think, by the way, is good for the customer; I think it is good for the agent; and I think it is good for the markets. Wild cyclicality up or down is actually bad for everybody. And better insight, better data, better analytics is actually better for everybody. You get better analysis, you get better, more thoughtful pricing related to risk. So that is a somewhat fulsome answer, but that is how I feel about it.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "That\u2019s really helpful, Jay. I guess just one other question. Related to the personal lines business, you guys have made big inroads with Quantum 2, sort of stabilizing your volumes there, getting a more competitive product to market. I am wondering what your plans are for Homeowners. It\u2019s been \u2013 a decade ago probably wasn\u2019t a very good business, but it sure seems like a very profitable one now. But it has been shrinking for many years. I am wondering what \u2013 when maybe we see you guys turn the corner there and start to use it as a growth engine. Thank you.", "Jay Fishman", "I\u2019m going to ask Doreen to answer. But just because I am allowed to be so proud of what the organization has done. So as far back as we see the data having, I will say, integrity, and that is at least 10 years and maybe more on a comparable basis, we have had 1 year in our Homeowners business with a combined ratio over 100 and that was 2011. That was the Joplin storms and the Tuscaloosa storms. So whether it was Ike, Gustav, and Dolly or Rita, Katrina, Wilma, it didn\u2019t matter.", "The way that business \u2013 actually I will come back to my previous comment about risk-taking. I am just so proud, candidly, of the way that whole organization has operated and thought about risk-taking. So we love the business, and it has been a terrific performer for us. And actually I personally think in the future as the potentials shift between Auto and Homeowners, I think it could very well do some shifting over the next 10 years. I love where we are; but with that, Doreen, you can take the rest.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Oh, thank you. And obviously, following on what Jay said, I will tell you that we spent and it goes back to I think one of the earlier questions, just about looking at weather. You probably recall we looked at pricing, we looked at underwriting, we looked at concentration, and we feel really that we are operating now from a position of really great returns. And we see that when we have a competitive Auto product that also helps drive Home, and we are going to look for those opportunities where we can tune the product, so that in those areas that we think it makes sense to grow, that we will.", "So again, we weren\u2019t planning just, we talked about Auto where we thought we were going to be flat to comparing ourselves fourth quarter to last year. We knew Home was going to lag a little bit behind that. So everything we are looking at with production is really according to what our expectations were. But as Jay said, we really were a property underwriter; we like the product; and we\u2019re going to look for the opportunities going forward.", "Josh Stirling \u2013 Sanford Bernstein", "Great, Doreen, Jay. Thank you so much.", "Gabriella Nawi", "This will conclude our call. As always, I am available in Investor Relations for any follow-up questions. Thank you for joining and have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded, January 22, 2015.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Tina. Good morning, all, and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results.", "Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond and Specialty Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.", "Before I turn it over to Jay, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance.", "Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website, travelers.com.", "With that, Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you have already seen from our release this morning, we closed out this year with record results. We achieved record levels of net income per diluted share for both, the quarter and the full year of $3.11 and $10.70, respectively.", "Our return on equity and operating return on equity were also very strong quarter, bringing our full year return on equity to 14.6% and operating return on equity to 15.5%. Just as important is what's behind those numbers.", "Across the organization, we couldn't be more pleased with how we have executed on our business strategies, including our approach to the marketplace in domestic business insurance, the introduction of Quantum 12.0 and moving our personal insurance business to be better positioned, the continuing evolution of our international footprint and our exceptional positioning in Bond & Specialty Insurance.", "Just as important is our capital management strategy. In 2014, we returned over $4 billion in capital to our shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while still maintaining our significant balance sheet strength.", "Reflecting on our performance over the last 10 years, now a decade since the merger, a few things stand out. When we introduced our long-term financial strategy in 2006, that is creating shareholder value by producing superior returns, driven by building meaningful and sustainable competitive advantages, generating top-tier earnings and capital substantially in excess of our growth needs and maintaining a balanced approach to rightsizing capital and growing book value per share over time, we were confident that it has been successful in the broadest sense beyond our expectations.", "Over these 10 years, our cumulative operating income has been approximately $31.6 billion and we have reduced our share count by more than 61%, returning $30.7 billion to shareholders through repurchases and dividends and amount exceeding the then market capitalization of the company, and we did this while still making investments that were important for our business and acquisitions that were opportunistic for us along the way.", "Consequently, we have produced a very strong average annual operating return on equity of 13.3% over that time. Our shareholders have benefited from superior total returns as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, where you can see the 1, 5 and 10-year performance of travelers compared to other U.S. financial companies. Obviously, we posted top-tier returns, but even looking globally we have identified only a small handful of large financial service companies, whose 10-year performance exceeds ours.", "We remain optimistic about our ability to successfully execute these strategies. Our own observation is that the markets in which we do business remained fairly stable. For the last several years, we have shared with you that while we recognize that we could be wrong, we were skeptical of the concept of the old-fashioned severe insurance pricing cycle, where a bell to go off and it would be a few years of very high price increases and then another bell would go off and there would be significant price declines.", "Our view was and remains that there are no substantive differences in the way business is conducted that have and we believe will continue to change the characteristics of our markets. We have talked about the stability of the market as evidenced by the high levels of retention, the fact that we are not the only company returning significant amounts of capital as well as the focus of the industry on returns on capital.", "Advanced analytics and a more demanding regulatory and oversight environment have also meaningfully contributed. While there will always be changes in pricing both, increases and decreases in response to changes in loss costs, expense , interest rates or changes in real or perceived risk, as there are in many industries, we continue to believe that the amplitude of the cycle has narrowed substantially.", "Beyond the insurance market dynamics, we have real confidence that our organizations is well positioned to successfully navigate whatever set of challenges the external environment may throw our way. With our relentless focus on execution, deep and talented management team, highly analytical approach to underwriting and investment risk and a very high respect for our shareholders' capital, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver meaningful shareholder value.", "With that let me turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thank you, Jay. By any measure, our fourth quarter results, record net income per diluted share of $3.11, record operating income per diluted share of $3.07, operating ROE of 17.7% and a combined ratio of 85%, were very strong.", "As has been the case all year, these strong results were built on very solid investment and underwriting performance. Within underwriting, we continue to earn rate increases in excess of loss cost trends, which was the driver of 100-basis point improvement in our underlying combined ratio this quarter versus the prior year quarter, while experiencing only a modest level of cap losses and very strong net favorable prior-year reserve development.", "Pre-tax cap losses were $41 million in the quarter, down $12 million from last year's fourth quarter and pre-tax net favorable PYD was $351 million, up $92 million. While each of our business segments contributed to the favorable reserve development, it was primarily driven by Bond & Specialty Insurance's as contract surety business for accident years 2012 and prior. By business and international insurances, general liability product line for accident years 2008 through 2012.", "As I have been doing in recent period, I would like to provide you with a preliminary view of what our combined 2014 Schedule P is expected to look like when filed on May 1st. On a combined stat basis, for all of our U.S. subs all accident years developed favorably. Looking at the data on a product line, rather than on an accident year basis, all of our major product lines developed favorably in the aggregate across all accident years, except for relatively small amounts of unfavorable development in CMP and in personal auto liability.", "CMP developed unfavorably by approximately $68 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $3.5 billion, spread out over several recent accident years. Our personal auto liability developed unfavorably by only $20 million pre-tax on a reserve base of approximately $2 billion, driven by development on a small number of large PIP claims from accident years 2005 and prior.", "I should also point out that the personal auto in total; combining liability and [ph] reserved development was essentially a wash as physical damage developed favorably by $18 million pre-tax. We have taken advantage of the recent evolution in aggregate CAT reinsurance products to restructure our CAT cover, further focusing on severe events that on a single or cumulative basis could impact capital.", "Effective January 1, we replaced our previous GEN CAT treaties, our $400 million CAT, aggregate excess of lost treaty which expires as scheduled on December 31, and our $400 million GEN CAT treaty, which our reinsurers agreed to terminate early as of that date, with a new aggregate ex-OL treaty that provides coverage for both, single events and accumulation of losses for multiple events. It is a simpler structure that provides $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 million excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It has a same broad pharaoh and geographic coverage of the former GEN CAT and ex-OL treaties and it positions the coverage layer to provide a significant buffer between earnings and capital.", "As an aggregate cover, there is a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, the cost is essentially the same as the previous program, but it provides greater potential recovery after the higher retention. Our Northeast GEN CAT treaty, or CAT bonds, earthquake and international covers remain unchanged and I refer you to Page 21 of the webcast for a brief description of the new treaty.", "Another subject I would like to touch upon relates to the recent drop in the price of oil. While this is not the first time that oil is trading at $45 a barrel, it was at today's levels as recently as 2009, we thought it would be helpful to provide you with the information appearing on Page 22 of the webcast, showing how much of our investment portfolio is invested in the low investment grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. As you can see, the sum of these investments is relatively small and we believe the exposure to be quite manageable.", "We continue to generate capital well in excess of what is needed to support our businesses and consistent with our strategy, we continue to return very significant amounts of capital to our shareholders. Operating cash flows were in excess of $500 million this quarter, inclusive of a $200 million discretionary contribution we decided to make to our qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows to almost $3.7 billion for the year.", "We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.6 billion after returning almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter alone through dividends of $182 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion. For the full-year, we returned almost $4.1 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $735 million and common share repurchases over $3.3 billion.", "One final note about share repurchases, since we began in 2006, the average price we paid for our shares was $57.56, approximately 60% of our current stock price. Once again, all of our capital ratios remain at or better than their target levels. Our debt to total capital ratio 21.7% was well within its target range. During the , book value per share increased 1% and adjusted book value per share, which excludes net unrealized investment gains and losses was also up slightly.", "For the full-year book value per share increased 10% and adjusted book value per share increased 7%, while net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 million after tax at the end of the year as compared to $1.3 billion at the beginning of the year.", "Now, let me turn things over to Brian MacLean", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Alan and Doreen are going to go over the individual segment results. Before they do, I want to make a few comments about our business and I will start with a significant progress we have made in personal lines.", "Three years ago, we discussed with you that we would be aggressively pursuing improvements in our financial returns in both, auto and homeowners primarily due to weather and auto severity trends. As we close out 2014, we couldn't be more pleased with the progress that we have made. We have taken necessary rate in both, our home and auto products while maintaining strong retention levels and we have tightened underwriting guidelines and made changes to terms and conditions in our homeowners' book.", "We also discussed that the increased utilization comparative raters by independent agent had resulted in a need to improve our competitive position in the auto market. To that end, we announced our production initiatives that would support the rollout of our new more competitive auto product Quantum Auto 2.0. We have now achieved our expense reduction goal and Quantum 2.0 is live in virtually all Quantum states.", "The impact from these bold actions on our results has been significant. Our homeowners' returns are in line with our target range and our top-line trends are improving. In auto, our returns are operating in a range that is acceptable to us given current market conditions. Importantly, our auto business is growing again and the higher new businesses creating long-term value, so overall, great progress in the independent agent channel.", "In the direct-to-consumer business, our decision to enter that channel reflected our belief that a large segment of the personal insurance market empowered by increased transparency of product and pricing information, would choose to buy insurance via the direct channel.", "While certain customer segments of this market have quickly embraced the direct channel, the customer demographic that Travelers target has moved more slowly. With that said we remain committed to the strategic channel and expect that over time it will become a more significant portion of our personal business.", "It is important to note that as we have invested in this channel, we have consciously targeted that investment to help strengthen our independent agent channel, which we believe, will continue to be a significant channel for our customer demographic, so we feel very good about this investment.", "The final point I would make in personal lines is the growing importance of the home product. Our industry is built around protecting consumers against risk, the greater the risk, the greater responsibility and opportunity we have. In that vein, the extreme weather volatility has added risk to the home exposure, making our industry-leading capabilities in the homeowners' line and even more significant competitive advantage and critical with the customer segment we target.", "Accordingly, we are continuing to invest to make sure that we maintain and leverage our industry-leading product as a part of a total customer portfolio solution. All-in, we feel great about the progress we have made in this business, we are proud of the many employees that have had a hand in executing these initiatives and we are grateful to our agents who have supported us throughout.", "In our commercial businesses, we are equally pleased with our progress, specifically seen in the steady improvement of our product returns which have been the driven by our consistent execution. As Jay Fishman, mentioned in his comments, we are encouraged by the continued stability of the market as evidenced by the strong retention levels we continue to see both, in our book and across the market.", "When we analyze our results at a very granular level, we see that we continue to be successful executing our basic pricing strategy which is to retain a high percentage of our business that is meeting target returns, improve profitability where needed, and quote on and write new business that meets our target returns.", "You will see in our results that we have had a bit more success last quarter in new business, but I would emphasize that that is a function of the improved returns on accounts we are seeing, and not a change in our appetite for new business. Alan will comment on this further, so overall, great results in 2014 with stable market conditions, very strong underwriting results.", "With that I will turn it over to Alan.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Brian, and good morning. For business in international insurance, our fourth quarter performance capped off a very good year, with operating income of $630 million in the quarter and more than $2.3 billion for the full-year.", "In terms of production results, in the U.S. retention rates increased throughout the year, stable renewal premium change reflecting gradual declines in renewal rate regain and improving exposure. We are very pleased with our execution in the field and I will comment more on that in a minute.", "For the full-year, the underlying combined ratio was strong 92.8%, a half-point improvement from the prior year. While earned pricing in excess of loss trend contributed favorably to year 2014 results, there was also negative impact of about 1.5 for non-catastrophe weather and large losses relative to the prior year.", "The underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. The underlying loss ratio improved 40 basis points driven by the earned impact of price increases exceeding loss trend, partially offset by large losses in non cat weather.", "Impact of large losses was about a 0.1 in the quarter, arising out of our international business. We see this as a normal level of large loss volatility. Expense ratio was a little higher year-over-year, due to the effects of some favorable expense items in the prior year quarter.", "Turning to production, we had a very strong quarter in PII with net written premiums up over 6% from the prior quarter, driven by our middle market business and inclusion of Dominion for the full quarter. In domestic BI retention increased to 83%, while renewal premium change increased somewhat from recent quarters and new business was up about 6%.", "These production results reflect what you have been hearing from us for the last year or so. That is, given the rate gains we have achieved over the past four years more of our business is achieving adequate return, and for those accounts or classes, our primary objective is retention.", "Importantly, in our domestic BI business, we are on average still achieving flat to slightly positive written rate gains on our better performing business segment. For the lesser performing segments of our business, we are on average achieving written renewal rate gains in excess of estimated loss trends.", "Let me comment on the growth on new business in middle market, both Jay and Brian commented on the stability in the marketplace. As a consequence of that stability, the number of requests for quotes on new business has also been relatively stable. However, given the cumulative impact of rate gains in the market broadly over the past four years, a modestly increasing percentage of the new business request that we did see in the quarter, where return levels that met our threshold. As a result, in the quarter we were able to quote successfully on more accounts. The new business growth in the quarter does not reflect any changes of our return thresholds or more aggressive new business pricing.", "Looking at the production statistics, I would like to highlights some further detail. In select, retention was over 80% for the second consecutive quarter, with total renewal premium change of a little over 8%. In middle-market, retention was above 84% for the second consecutive quarter and renewal premium change was strong and increased slightly from the third quarter, a great result.", "In our other domestic BI business, we were pleased that both rate and exposure increased from the third quarter, resulting in 100-basis point increase, sequentially, in renewal premium change. Also, our retention increased to 81%, the highest level in more than two years.", "Looking at our production results for international, retention was strong at 82%, slightly higher than recent quarters. Renewal premium change was higher than the third quarter as exposures improved. New business was down year-over-year, primarily because the new business we saw did not meet our return threshold.", "In December, we were pleased to announce that our joint venture with J. Malucelli in Brazil, agreed to acquire a majority interest in Cardinal, a start-up surety provider in Columbia. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.", "To sum it up, we are very pleased with our strong operating income and production results for the fourth quarter and the momentum we feel going into 2015. In terms of execution going forward, we intend to pursue more of the same.", "With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Thank you, Alan. Good morning to all. Bond & Specialty Insurance had a great quarter, rounding out a strong 2014. Both, the fourth quarter and full-year results, are record earnings for the business and we are very pleased with the financial returns in this segment.", "For the fourth quarter, operating income was $216 million, 24% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013, while full-year income of $727 million was 27% higher than 2013. The increases from prior year were predominantly driven by the higher levels of favorable prior year reserve development that Jay Benet referenced earlier.", "The underlying combined ratio for both, the quarter and full year were strong at 84.1% and 82.2%, respectively. The quarter was slightly higher than 2013, due to a modest re-estimation of prior quarter losses. The full-year result was 2.5 points better than 2013, due primarily to benefits from existing our management liability excess of loss treaty.", "While there will always be some ups and downs in the year-over-year variances. I cannot emphasize enough how terrifically feel about the results, in particular the underlying fundamentals of how we achieved them.", "As with all of our businesses at Travelers, we remain committed to superior underwriting performance of our portfolios through aggressive management of risk and limits, including enhanced segmentation, underwriting analytics and claims management.", "Turning to production, net written premium for the quarter was $525 million, a decrease of 5% compared to the prior year, due to the exit of our management liability excess of loss treaty in the fourth quarter of 2013, which increased that period in net written premium. The non-renewal of this treaty in 2014, together with higher surety volume, drove 4% increase in net written premium for the full-year. Across our management liability businesses, retention of 84% was consistent with recent period in the prior year, while new business premium of $36 million was generally consistent with recent period.", "Renewal premium change, which can be somewhat lumpy due to variations in things like limits, written liability, attachment point and policy duration, was 5% for the quarter. In sum, I would like to reiterate one more time just how great we feel about the business and our ability to continue to produce superior financial results.", "I will turn now to personal insurance, where I would first like to reiterate Brian's comments about the progress made in the business and how great we feel about our ability to have a vibrant consumer business that generates appropriate returns.", "We had a great fourth quarter rounding out a strong 2014. Operating income for the quarter was $242 million, up slightly from the fourth quarter of 2013, while underlying income of $254 million was up 18% for the quarter from the prior year, driven by strong underwriting results.", "The underlying combined ratio of 84.3% in the quarter was an improvement of 4.5 points from 2013, while the full-year underlying combined ratio was 86.4%, an improvement of about two points from 2013. The improvement in underlying results from '13 for both, the quarter and full year, reflect continued benefits from earned pricing exceeding loss trends and our expense reduction initiatives.", "Before addressing the specific results for auto and homeowners, I wanted to give some detail on our expense reduction initiative. You will recall that our plan was to achieve pre-tax savings of $140 million on a run rate basis by 01/01/2015, and we are pleased to tell you that we have achieved that goal.", "As we have discussed in the past, about half of these reductions relate to claim management expenses, the impact of which shows up in the loss ratio. Since we started the program in the third quarter of 2013, there is about $100 million in cumulative pre-tax savings already in our earnings through the end of 2014. For the remaining $40 million, initiatives have already been executed and they will earn through in 2015.", "With this specific initiative met and now behind us, please rest assured that we will continue to manage expenses diligently as we always have.", "Looking at agency auto, retention remained strong and consistent at 83%, while renewal premium change was about 5%. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to drive improvements in production, with new business premium of $161 million in the quarter, 87% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013 and overall net written premiums increased 4% for the quarter. We have also seen increases in policies enforced on a sequential basis for two consecutive quarters now.", "Turning to agency auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 97.9%, an improvement of about four points and was 95.9 % for the full-year, an improvement of just over 0.5 for their comparable 2013 period. These improvements were driven by benefits from the expense initiatives and earned pricing exceeding loss trend, partially offset by the higher impact of new business volumes. In addition, the quarter included approximately 2.5 points of favorable prior quarter re-estimation.", "Lastly, on auto, our current view of the overall auto loss trend remains at about 3%, with no meaningful change in the underlying texture. Looking at agency, homeowners and other, production was strong in the quarter, with retention stable at 84% and renewal premium change of about 6%.", "New business premium of $83 million was up almost 40% from the prior year quarter and we remained focused on maximizing our market leadership position in the homeowners' line to provide broad consumer solution.", "From a profitability perspective, the underlying combined ratio of 69% was an improvement of more than 5 points over the fourth quarter of 2013, driven by earned pricing exceeding loss trend and favorable losses including non-cat weather. Overall in personal insurance, a terrific finish to 2014, and we feel great about our momentum heading into 2015.", "Finally I would like to echo one of Brian's earlier comments, and this applies to all of our employees, in all of the businesses. We are very proud of the hard work of all of our employees and grateful for the partnership with our agents in achieving these results.", "With that I will turn the call back to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Tina, we are now ready for Q&A. I would ask you all to please limit yourselves to one question and one follow. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Randy Binner of FBR. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Great. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to touch on the commentary around rate increases now moving below the increase in exposures. I appreciate the commentary that, I think you think you feel like you are getting rate ahead of loss cost and you are more focused on retention there, but a couple of questions.", "One, I assume there is going to be competitive profits to keep retention, so any new initiatives there or any more color on how you plan to keep retention higher.", "Then, as far as the absolute rate increase number we all watch so closely, I guess, I mean, is by definition we have to see that continue to moderate if you are achieving the rate adequacy.", "Jay Fishman", "Hi. This is Jay. Alan and I, I think, we will tag team this. First, just to be clear about rate gains, first, I assume you are speaking about our business insurance segment. I think, what Alan said was in our best-performing segments of that business, talking really about the middle-market predominantly, but it goes even beyond that.", "In our best-performing business, we continue to experience, let's call it, flat to upper point in terms of rate. Now, relative obviously an overall loss trend for that segment, it is not keeping pace with it. I would tell you that we are not attempting to. That is not our principal focus.", "Alan also said that in the poorer performing classes that rate gains there continue to exceed loss trends, so that's where we are. The reason I said we are not uniquely focused on that is that we are a return-driven organization and we ask of folks who have managed this just excellently to remember its agency relationships, its customer relationships and it is how you manage your business over time that matters.", "We start off with returns over time, that translates to account management over time, so if an account has had, and I am speaking very, very broadly here, but if account has had three years of increases and they have been a good account and we value them, we tell our people that there's nothing wrong with renewing that flat. It doesn't mean that if there's an opportunity to do a little better because circumstances suggest it, claim activity rising or otherwise, but they should attempt to do it, but that we manage our relationships and returns on accounts over time, so I suspect report, I part that if we are right about the cycle dynamics that you will see more of a stair step in rate gains more than sort of a constant trend line and ultimately I suspect with it the granularity of our discussion our best-performing accounts versus our poorer performing accounts will become more relevant in perhaps the way you see the world.", "Now, that's first part.", "The second, you spoke about retentions. We are not doing anything differently with respect to retain business than we ever have done and I am sure Alan can give you more color and will, but the way generally business is renewed, if the agent is satisfied, the customer is satisfied, if the market is satisfied, the discussions take place pretty early, well in advance of the renewal date, the account gets resolved at whatever it is and it gets renewed whether it is down a point zero, up a point or differently, so it is [ph] the retention discussions have become as you described more competitive. That simply isn't how the business is done.", "Those conversations take place given the data and the analytic we have in the context of long-term account management and doing right thing for the customer the agent for the long-term. I let Alan give some more color on that, but there wasn't anything in the world of retention that we are doing differently.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Randy, it is Alan Schnitzer. Let me also address both of those quickly. Industry observers tend to focus very narrowly on rate change and the long-term estimated loss trend we give you, and I would remind of comments during the quarter, which is there is a component of price change, which includes exposure that from a return perspective and from margins acts like rate, so we don't look at the narrow GAAP between rate and loss trend may be quite as precisely as industry observers do, and there is always variations quarter-to-quarter in weather and large losses and all those sorts of things that create volatility plus or minus within an expected range, so we are really in a pretty tight band.", "In terms of retention, I would have given you the same comments Jay did about our efforts, and I would highlight a real competitive advantage that we have. This is not us needing to do anything else. We have got an extraordinary deal capability, we have got great presence in the field, great tenure in the field, we have got great relationships, we have got great related services like our risk control and it is those sorts of things not developed this month or this quarter, but over many years that give us the ability to manage retention in a way that we think is most productive from a profitability perspective.", "Jay Fishman", "I would add. Again, that is exactly right. It is not uniquely a price discussion. It is important; it is only one element of long-term relationships and management. Lastly, at least through the third quarter, obviously with the first one out in the PC business this quarter retention is what I would consider all the quality companies they are all high. It is not that we are describing a set of circumstances that are unique for us. We think we manage it better than anybody else and maybe that is sort of our own pride in it, but the fact is that it is not our business that has been stable. It is broadly speaking, the industry's that has been stable and that is what so important.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "Very helpful. Just one quick follow-up and that is for Jay Fishman on stair step comment on rate. I didn't quite follow how that fit in a conversation, but I think you are saying is the good part of the book becomes more rate adequate. The places where you are trying to seek rate increases may have kind of a bigger impact on a quarterly basis on what we see for rate change. Is that what you meant by the stair step versus the trend?", "Jay Fishman", "Yes. I did, but the second part of that is that at the account level you may see a year, two years where in an account renew is flat, and then there is an attempt to recover, if you will, some of that loss margin relative to loss trend on that account. We are not a company. We have not issued an edict to the field that says get trend on every account. That would be a dumb thing to do. We say to them manage the long-term return given everything you know about the agent, the account, profile of that account and manage it thoughtfully and if that means that account is going to renew flat for a year or two, that is okay, so that is really the comment about stair step that I was speaking to.", "Randy Binner - FBR", "All right. Very good. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you and good morning. Jay, I know this is somewhat of a sensitive topic and I hope you are feeling well, most importantly. If you could update us on the health condition that was disclosed several months ago, along with any update in succession plans, that would be helpful initially. Thank you.", "Jay Gelb", "Sure. I appreciate the question. I have no sensitivity about it by the way, none at all, so first, thank you. I do continue to feel okay. I am here, I am on the job, I am still mobile. It's a little clunkier than it was and everybody here is helpful above and the call of duty and making sure that not only I can continue to do my job, but everybody here can continue to do theirs.", "As I disclosed, and someone asked me why did I disclose it, and the answer is because I needed to, to continue to do the job effectively. It was becoming apparent for those who were around me a lot that something was amiss and it was prior leave people in confusion and doubt or provide some clarity with respect to my circumstance. I have chosen not to be specific about the ailment really in respect of my privacy and my family's privacy and just do not think that it really matters a whole lot. Its relevance is I am 62, there isn't anything about my circumstance that causes me to change my view of my ability to continue work here as I did, I have something else to say, so the horizon is unchanged in that regard.", "We have been an active succession planning company for a long time and pretty transparently. If you look and see what we have done and what we have announced, it doesn't take a real genius to see what we are doing and what the next generation of leadership here is.", "I chuckled where 62 is kind of a magic number here Brian 62, I am 62, Jay Benet,62 Bill Heyman is 60-plus, so it is just that responsibility falls on us to make sure that we do this seamlessly, seamlessly. I would tell you that a board knows virtually everything. I have been completely transparent to them, and to the extent anyone really is interested, I have already begun to cut back fairly meaningfully on my non-travelers commitments and I will continue to do that, so that I can focus exclusively maybe, but there [ph] things are not going to give up, but to focus relentlessly on what matters here, so that's the news of the day.", "Jay Gelb", "I appreciate that. Thank you. Switching gears for Jay Benet, the capital return in 2014 for Travelers was 112% operating income, including dividends and buybacks. How should we think about that for the years going forward?", "Jay Benet", "There is really no change in the philosophy, there is no change in what we have said in the 10-Ks and Qs, earnings are going to drive what we are able to return subject to the number of items that we list and contributions being one of them.", "When you look at a particular quarter, you are going to see the ebbs and flows of what has taken place in terms of earnings from prior quarters, making the determination as to how much in particular in that quarter we will be able to return to shareholders, so there is no change in philosophy, no change in the kind of basis upon which it is done, all we were seeing is some excess capital actually that we ended the prior year with, working its way into the share repurchases in 2014.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Thanks. Jay Benet, I was wondering if you could follow-up a little bit on the development, maybe give us a little bit more color, maybe the breakdown between surety and GL. I am more interested in GL but on the surety piece how much is the non-renewal of that management liability treaty. How much of the impact of that has already come through.", "Then on GL, just trying to some idea on that '08 to '12 accident years, where are the most recent alternates on those books of business as compared to where you are looking in that business today. Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "I think some of that is a level of granularity. You will probably see when we file the Schedule P. You know we are in the process of summarizing all that data, so to give a very detailed information at this point in time, I think, would be a bit of a mistake. What we are trying to do is, give the overall picture as to how things have developed and in terms of the individual products, the individual accident years, so what we are trying to communicate was yes there was major shift in anything that affected PYD.", "As far as your specific question on the surety reinsurance, that has no effect on development. That's a contract that was in place that was looked at in terms of its cost benefit and we decided that it was not really something that was achieving the objectives and from a profitability standpoint and a risk standpoint, we would be better off not having it, but that really had nothing to do with PYD.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Okay. Thanks. Then just on expenses, the ratio in BI kind of dropped in the back half of last year and kind of stayed at that level first part of this year and now we have risen now to 32.5-ish range. Where should we expect to see that? I mean, is that where, you know, I am thinking about whether it is Dominion or something else?", "I mean, is there an opportunity to kind of bring that back down to what we were seeing over the trailing 12 months in the second quarter or is that where you expect to efficiently run? Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "It is Alan again. If you look at the full year expense ratio, I think it was 30, 31.5 and that had a benefit in it from the first quarter that we disclosed then. That was on the year worth about half a point. If you adjust that first quarter event and have that half point again, round numbers that sort of what we feel like would be a fair run rate.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Sorry. The benefit, remind you also workers' compensation state assessment liability that we talked about\u2026", "Alan Schnitzer", "We had a reduction in estimated liability that we announced in the first quarter and we quantified it, so you will see it in our press release and 10-Q for the first quarter, so that really was the anomaly this year, so if you add that back in and look at the full year, round numbers I would say, it is always going to be up or down a little bit for one thing or another, but that will give you sort of a ballpark.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. Great. Then last one for Jay Fishman. Is there anything that you think could happen in the reinsurance market as far as evolution or innovation that would allow you or how you to consider pursuing more growth in catastrophe exposed areas utilizing reinsurance or is that something at this point that is still not something that you foresee. Thanks again.", "Jay Fishman", "Sure. It is irrelevant question of course. First, we are engaged, involved and looking at lots of different things. The specific question you asked is, are you prepared to build primarily exposure and rely on a reinsurance profile that may or may not be permanent to produce an effective loss profile and there is the potential of mismatches there are substantial.", "Meaning, on the primary side very difficult to non-renew. Reinsurance, obviously, to be non-renewed instantly, when that happens, even if you pursue a primary non-renewable strategy, that 12 months where you had to think where the primary exposure sits and the reinsurance is simply not there anymore, so that is an arbitrage that I think as a potential mismatch to it that's concerning.", "Now, if reinsurance pricing were to drift low enough, in my judgment it is not there yet, you might sit there and contemplate doing that, but I would say that the mismatch risk there has real shareholder value attachment to it as well as regulatory.", "I mean, imagine trying to non-renew a significant enough book of business, where you would actually do this as a strategy as opposed to an operate tactic. It would be very disruptive, so I think not in that regard, but it doesn't mean that there might not be other opportunities and we are sure pushing it around. It is not obvious to us yet.", "Pluses and minuses, these things will have certain complexities to them, but it is not obvious to us yet that there is some magic, a dynamic there that has happened, the changes, the fundamental underlying economics of being the primary business. Now, maybe it keep going in that direction, but - not yet.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Great. Thank you so much, Jay.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Josh Stirling of Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Josh Stirling", "Good morning, Jay. Glad you brought up the St. Paul Travelers' deal. I think it is really interesting topic for us to talk about today. Going back 10 years, people were not sure about the deal, but it has obviously been a fantastic success. As we are seeing a new wave of consolidation, I am curious to hear your perspective on the M&A we are seeing in the market today?", "When you think about the opportunities you guys are presenting, I am sure you have had a lot of opportunities to consider and debate this, and I am wondering more specifically, you have made a couple of smaller investments in the past couple of years. Should we expect you to do more of these as stock buybacks become more expensive in your multiple runs or alternatively should we expect you potentially to be more of a material consolidator in the small and mid-cap consolidation rate that seems to be starting? Just would love to get a sense how you think about capital priorities here.", "Jay Fishman", "It is a really good question, so let us break it into a couple of component parts. First, on the international horizon, to the extent and the Columbia situation was a pretty good one, I think, Dominion even though it was a $1 billion trade, to the extent there are opportunities to do things of that nature, where a business is either relatively new or underperforming and we think that collectively locally and what we bring ourselves, we can improve it, we will continue to look for those opportunities.", "It is they are increasingly harder to find, driven in some measure by the economics. Much of the economic environment outside the U.S., as well as the general competitive environment that exists outside the U.S. There are lot of areas where you would say kind of the last thing you want to do is, be competing there, and that was just not been in significant list, but nonetheless to the extent that opportunities present themselves in international front, we will we will most certainly look at them.", "I would not contemplate, by the way I could be completely wrong here. Meaning, you are asking me for an outlook, I am giving it to you today, that doesn't mean that we could change, but I would not contemplate that those would be large transactions.", "I do not know how one would look at Dominion. I do not think of it as a large transaction, meaningful, but I would not contemplate that international front, what would be that.", "We really have no interest in the reinsurance business in the broadest sense, so to the extent that there are the things happening in the arena Bermuda or otherwise, we largely do not pay attention to it and I do not really have a view on the value that has created there. I am not knowledgeable I am not close enough to it to have a thoughtful view.", "We have always said about acquisitions and this hasn't changed. It is very, very much the same. We are a return-driven organization, the principal view that we would take for looking at anything is what would it do to our return profile over time. Would it potentially improve our return dynamics and that could be either in magnitude or in volatility. To the extent there is diversification, geographic expansion and providing lower volatility returns that could meet the threshold also.", "The challenge for us in that regard is that, when you do something small in our business, you take all the risks of whatever it was, whatever undisclosed liability, whatever policy was written 20, 30, 40 years ago, you have got it. In many cases, the controls and procedures and knowledge base that exists in small companies just did not [ph] to warrant the risk they could take to getting into it. They just don't have the database that gives you a sense of comfort, when you are spending your shareholders' money that it is wise.", "In the larger transactions, given that we are such a high return organization, relative to the industry, it is hard to find at a price that can be achieved, a transaction that would meet that return threshold. They would [ph] for sure, but that is interesting, but not highly relevant. We are big enough, we do not need to be any bigger, but we are driven about returns, driven by them.", "If something significant were ever to be available, we would look and we would look hard. I do think that we are really good. By the way, at the front end at the back-end meaning - that goes on, when we look at something. Then, once we decide to proceed the execution side and a complex and complicated transaction, I think we are pretty good at that and I am speaking out for what is what people know in the marketplace, but also what you don't know. The things that we have looked at, the things that we have walked away from, because our own due diligence suggested no, that is not for us, so it's good.", "I think the challenge will be meeting all those standards. That doesn't mean we do not roll up our sleeves and dig in and we will continue to try, so but again that's my answers [ph] I can give you.", "Josh Stirling", "That is helpful, Jay. Thank You. If I could sneak in a quick one on pricing, so look I get that it used to be very cyclical industry and you have become much more data-driven and the company is more disciplined.", "If you are in the trenches in you are an actuary and underwriter, should we be expecting that generally a good - be able to cover their cost over the next couple of years, raising pricing you know 2%, 3%, whenever that entails or is that just kind of unrealistic, but it is still competition and capacity still matters and basically the market price is going to be driven by the more aggressive guys who probably do not do as good a job managing their business and they cut the market price to reduce margins, and sales and shift top-line growth?", "Jay Fishman", "I am always hesitant to speak for any other company, because I can only from the outside in proceed how you are manage their business, but I can speak to what we do and how we run our business.", "Underwriters will do, good ones, will do with precision what you ask them to do, so you better be really good at knowing what you are asking of them. We have taken the view, when I might - from the outside looking in is that we are not unique in this regard others too. If you tell an underwriter grow, they will. We don't tell them that, we tell them to find thoughtful ways to deploy capital. If they cannot, it is okay. It's okay. No one will ever be asking you why they did not meet their volume budget, because first time you asked them that they will meet at the next quarter and all of us understand that you would never speak to loan officer that way at the back.", "You would not say to a loan officer here is your volume goal and the torpedo is full speed ahead. If we do not perceive that there is a lot of difference between that risk profile and speaking to field underwriter, so we value their judgment and their insight and the data and analytics that we have in front of them to make thoughtful decisions to own the account, to think about do I want that account in my portfolio for the long-term, and what will it do to the return of my portfolio in a collaborative environment of the type that we have here.", "Really I cannot underestimate, I cannot overstate rather, I am sorry. I can't overstate how different that is than it was 20 years ago. It is just quite different. I think most importantly is that the feedback loop between what goes on in the field and what is really - knowledge at the home office to ways going on is stunningly shorter than it was 20 years ago, so the ability to act and react to changes not just cyclical big time changes, but local changes on offices, on market, on company in a local place is just that much better.", "I believe, again, I could be dead wrong. I think that the cyclicality of our business is and will be meaningfully reduced. Anybody who has tried prices are up now let's grow, I can't think of one company that has successfully executed that strategy in any meaningful way. If you look at history, it becomes difficult to say, boy that is a smart thing to do. I think the people who manage our businesses understand what it means to manage your risk profile and as a consequence they will do so.", "Now, on a given year, where we seek a - we will receive if long-term, if loss trend is 4%, we would be stupid to tell underwriters they got to get 4% on every account. That means we are losing accounts that don't need 4% in their returns and we will get 4% on those accounts that we - so we say to them be return-driven with that account, be smart, be thoughtful and be return-driven and it has worked for us.", "I think if there is anything about our results over these particularly last five years, I think that many industry observers have not appreciated how productive that approach can be to profitability improvement. Getting the right rate on the right account is really what it is all about. I think more and more people are beginning to understand that.", "Josh Stirling", "Thank you, Jay.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Tina, next question, please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jay Cohen", "Yes. Two quick questions. Maybe the other one a little bit last, quick. Since we have had a notable drop in interest rates, if you can give us a sense of what the new money yields look like for your portfolio versus the portfolio yield today?", "Bill Heyman", "Well, Jay Benet has given you an idea of what our expectations would be over the next two or three years due to the drop in interest rates. We did that in the back of the envelope last night that is already, but last night the new money rates were about 50 basis points lower than the rates Jay was using in making his calculation which would equate to about $20 million after taxes of lower earnings, $20 million a year, the delta.", "This morning the tenure rate is up a little bit, but that $20 million is $15 million or $16 million, but there is no question that these rates are lower. Last year, as we look at our investment results, which including 2013 much to our surprise, they did so notwithstanding the fact that their rates were lower than our projections at the beginning of the year. We made for this year a new set of projections, which already looks 22 days in, but we are not [ph] in yet, but nonetheless about $20 million a year different.", "Jay Fishman", "That\u2019s was Bill Heyman speaking.", "Jay Cohen", "Right. The tenure is actually down a little bit today, but at the end of the call - who knows. Second question, if we could get more color on international price change. We saw the premium change, but obviously I think exposure, but what's happening from a pricing standpoint in your major international markets?", "Jay Benet", "I do not have this slide in front of me right now, but I think it is in the webcast. You are talking about rate internationals?", "Jay Cohen", "Yes.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would say what is there in RPC is split probably pretty evenly between rate and exposure.", "Jay Cohen", "Okay. You are still getting overall increased internationally?", "Alan Schnitzer", "We still have an overall positive renewal rate change in international, yes. The other thing I would tell you about our international relative to U.S. is our outlook for loss trend in outside the U.S. it is lower in the U.S., because we do not have the same level of exposure to the medical inflation.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Is that being helped by Canada, the rate change?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes. I would say the rate in Canada is a higher end of the spectrum.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Thanks Alan.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Tina next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney Capital. Please go ahead.", "Larry Greenbergs", "Good morning. Thank you. I am just wondering if you can characterize how non-cat weather and large losses came in for the full year 2014, relative to what would be viewed as normal?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It's Alan Schnitzer. I do not know if you are talking about business insurance, but I will started in and turn it over to Jay maybe for a - if we grew cats, did you say cats\u2026", "Jay Fishman", "Non-cat", "Larry Greenbergs", "The stuff that would flow into underlying...", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes. Certainly above expectation and above the prior year.", "Jay Fishman", "Yes. I think when you look at the entire company, because this is going to be yes, it is like what you are asking if that large losses non-cat weather, they are going to be episodic, there are going to be dependent upon geography and things of that sort. When you look at the entire company, I do not think that this year 2014 was all that unusual a year as it relates to weather.", "I am talking non-cat weather now. When you look at BI, when you look at, I am talking non-cat weather now. You know when you look at PI and BI combined, it was probably pretty normal although BI was a little higher and PI was probably a little lower in terms of what they might consider to be normal.", "I think when you make the contrast to last year, which gets you away from an expectation and gets you into the weather and large loss activity of last year, meaning 2013 versus 2014, now there are I think 2014 was a little worse than 2013, but still a good year. Hopefully that is helpful.", "Larry Greenbergs", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "What we tried to do in the press release was to provide you not with the data, because it is difficult to measure these things but to adopt the phrase of normal variability in loss activity from quarter-to-quarter try to accommodate the sort of thought process and get away from the - Now, is it good is it bad, it is going to vary. Hopefully, when you get to a full year, some of the variances is less pronounced.", "Jay Benet", "It's a challenge for us to estimate normal non-cat weather. It is easier for us to speak about non-cat weather this year compared to last, this quarter compared to last year's quarter, but it has been exceptionally difficult for us to come to what would be a normal non-cat weather numbers, so we have a hard time speaking to it that way.", "Jay Fishman", "If I could just add, an example of what makes it difficult, you have times when given the granularity of what we look at, you will be looking an information and say well large losses activities is up somewhere. Then you get into and why is it up, well because slips and walls [ph] are taken, but the slips and walls, because of the weather. Yes. It is a very difficult bucketing process to end up summarizing all of this data and what we try to do is give you the concepts of what taking place.", "Larry Greenbergs", "Great. Now, that is helpful. Then on direct, I listened to what you had said earlier about continuing to invest in that business. The last couple of years, you have generated statutory underwriting losses of about $100 million from the businesses growing top-line a bit, you are getting a little bit of scale economics probably.", "I mean, when we think about that over the next few years, is that sort of the normal run rate of what expectations should be? I mean, is there going to be a drop in investment spending somewhere out there?", "Jay Fishman", "Well, this is Jay Fishman. I do not have a better number if I were looking out and one we are experiencing now and. To the extent markets change, certainly have not changed, obviously our strategy will, but if we start off with the premise that - when we started this investment, we said it. We said we were less concerned than some industry observers if a typical Travelers customer would go to buying direct, but we were not ready to bet the trumpet [ph] and therefore ignore the trends, so the development has been important.", "It is not apparent to us yet that there are enough Travelers-type customers who choose to buy direct or a direct business is scalable on it owned. It is not that we don't know how to get people to respond or how to quote and had issue, we would become really, really good at that that.", "It is that the number of people that we would think of as the customer that we seek are not choosing to respond that way, now that may change three or four or five years from now. It is a trend. I don't think it is appropriate to ignore it, so we will continue to develop the expertise and the skill, so that if in fact things change and there is a market opportunity for us, we are in a position to respond and we are not\u2026", "The other point I would make and I do not know how to quantify it for you, but I would tell you that the benefit to the agency business, the investment, the technology and the underlying customer reach attributes, the ways customer connects to us, our ability to respond as and as a, I will call it an electronic company, for lack of a better term that has just been invaluable.", "I don\u2019t know how any dollars it meant in the agency business, but I do know it is important. As I would remind everyone, I am not so unhappy that, that the Travelers' customer has not turned away from the agency channel as quickly as some people though. That is good for us. We have got a very big agency based business that is very profitable. If that change continues to occur more slowly, that is just fine with us, so this is a kind of a hedge your position investment that is necessary, because it is just not clear that it will continue this way, but I would say, yes. That is what I would certainly included if was..", "Larry Greenbergs", "Great. Thanks for your comments.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Thank you. Tina, this will be our last and final question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes. Thanks. Just two quick ones here. First, one for Alan and Jay, if I look at the business insurance business right now, and we look at the returns that are generating, they are pretty attractive right now. Is there any consideration or thought about having underwriters expand their risk profile right now kind of looking maybe into the E&S market a little bit, I know there are kind of ebbs and flows with the cycles. Also loss trend continues to be pretty favorable, so I think that is an area for growth?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes. Brain it is Alan. I guess the way we would think about that is, we are always challenging ourselves to think about whether there are new marketplace opportunities, but I would distinguish that from changing our risk profile to do it.", "If we could find opportunities whether it is in energy or whether it is in E&S or any other market, we would certainly look at it, but that would not involve any change in our return thresholds or our risk appetite.", "Brian Meredith", "Got you. Okay. Then the second one is for Doreen. Just looking at the homeowners, continued to see the declines in PIF, any thoughts on when that could start to stabilize or maybe start to trend upwards and what impact do you think the decline in PIF in the homeowners business is having on your auto insurance growth here?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Brian. Good morning. I will answer that with a couple of different comments. We put some, as Brian referenced in his comments, due to some of the weather that we were seeing coming through the book and just where the levels of deductibles were and roof issues, we took some pretty strong actions in the homeowners' book.", "Some of our declines there were deliberate, whether it might be some concentration in some areas, so it was not unexpected to us that we would see some shrinkage. That being said, we feel really great of that we have come through the other side of that where our deductibles are, where the PIF is.", "The rest of the market probably was not as aggressive as we were in addressing property, but from where we are today and launching forward, we are very excited about that. We feel like we have got just a great launch point on that, because we look at account underwriting, there is no question that when there is pressure on one product, there might be some impact to the other product around either new business or retention. We have seen with QA 2 as we have become more competitive there, that we think that has allowed us to start growing the home line again.", "We are still in a negative position, but I can tell you that for 2015 and beyond that is going to be a very strong focus of ours, whether it is going to be how we do digital marketing, leading with some of our home capabilities, because we think they are industry-leading, whether it is to look at some different kind of practices in the quote process or an overall customer view, so we can utilize the strength in the property line to actually get not just more homeowners business, but more customer business for the Travelers.", "We knew that homeowners was going to be, the recovery was going to follow auto, so we are in the spot that we thought we would be and there is a lot of focus on that.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Thanks for answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any closing remarks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Thank you all for joining us today. As always, I will be available for further follow-up.

Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our 2015 third quarter results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Jay Fishman, Chairman and CEO; Alan Schnitzer, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Business and International Insurance and who as already announced will succeed Jay as CEO on December 1; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance.", "They will go through the financial results of our business and the current market environment.

We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now it\u2019s my pleasure to pass it to Jay Fishman.", "Jay Fishman", "Thank you, Gabi and good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. By now you have seen our third quarter results and as you can see from the release it was a terrific quarter that adds meaningfully to our very strong 2015 year-to-date performance. ", "We reported operating income of $918 million and an impressive operating return on equity of 16.2%, bringing our year-to-date results from more than $2.5 billion in operating income and a nearly 15% operating return on equity. We achieved these results through very strong underwriting performances across all of our business segments and solid investment performance consistent with our expectations. ", "Our long term average annual operating return on equity stands at 13.4%, well in excess of our cost of capital and since 2006 we have returned a total of more than $33.5 billion in capital to our shareholders, remarkable numbers and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. ", "We have shared with many of you that one of our missions over the last couple of years has been to identify that which we do right and institutionalize those behaviours to make sure that they have continuity and will continue to contribute to our absolute as well as our relative superior performance. Some of those behaviours are obvious and they include things like our remarkable expertise in workers\u2019 comp claim handling which certainly provides Travelers with a relative competitive advantage. ", "But as I reflected on this quarter\u2019s earnings as well as the string of quarters that we put together over the recent past, my hypothesis is that the competitive advantage of analytics, risk selection and pricing management have had a meaningful effect, particularly cumulatively. I can\u2019t prove it to you because I don't know what our results would have been if we weren't just good as we are. But I do believe that one of the important factors that has led us to produce industry-leading returns is the fact that we have managed the changing rate environment over the last five years as effectively as we have. ", "Everybody understands that our capital management policies have added to those returns and that analysis is easy to do. But I am a believer that the numerator in that calculation has been positively impacted and will continue to be so by the way we have managed with rate retention and capital allocation across all accounts. I am certain that it has mattered and you should know that the commitment to analytical insight that produces these advantages is very much a part of the DNA of this place. ", "In short, the place is in great shape. It was another impressive quarter. It\u2019s business as usual and it feels like the perfect time to be conveying the leadership to the next generation. And in that regard, let me turn the call over to Alan. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Jay and good morning. It was a great quarter and speaking for the next generation, we\u2019re very grateful to be stepping in with things in such great shape. Thanks for that Jay and congratulations. ", "I will share just a few thoughts this morning before Brian and Doreen take you through the segment results and let me start with personal insurance. ", "We are about two years into Quantum Auto 2.0 and the results have been excellent. Our initial loss experience is in line with our original estimates while the take-up of the product has been better and faster than we had anticipated. It\u2019s nice to see the industry auto policy count and premium growing, very well done and congratulations to the team. ", "In business and international insurance and bond specialty, we posted excellent results. We are pleased to see production in a quarter that reflects a continuation of the trends we have been seeing all year, very high and consistent retentions reflective of the stable marketplace and steady real premium increases at levels that are reflective of healthy returns. These results are consistent with the messaging we\u2019re giving to our field organization which is to retain those accounts that are meeting our return expectation and to try and improve the profitability on those accounts that don\u2019t. ", "In that regard, in our middle market business, we continue to be successful in improving the written margins on our quintile four and five business. As you\u2019ve heard us say many times, including in Jay\u2019s commentary this morning, we managed on a very granular account by account or class by class basis and giving current returns that blends to a very high retentions and stable renewal premium increases. ", "To sum it up, the operating and production results over the past nine months are very encouraging and taken together with our relentless focus on execution and deep and talented management team give us great confidence in our ability to continue to deliver superior returns. ", "And with that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. As you heard from Jay and Alan, we are very pleased with our third quarter results: operating income of $918 million, up from $893 million in the prior year quarter and operating return on equity of 16.2%, up 100 basis points from last year\u2019s third quarter. Current operating income was driven by a very strong consolidated combined ratio of 86.9% which was 3.1 points better than the prior year quarter. This improvement resulted from the continuation of very strong current accident year underwriting performance along with higher net favorable reserve development. ", "Operating income was also driven by solid net investment income which was consistent with our expectations although lower than the very strong prior year quarter. Fixed income NII of $422 million after tax is down $32 million from the prior year quarter principally due to what we have been saying for many years now \u2013 securities that had higher book yields have run off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields through the current interest rate environment. ", "Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation. ", "Non-fixed income NII of $68 million after tax was down $53 million from a very strong prior year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity and hedge fund returns. Private equities and hedge funds produced NII of $35 million after tax this quarter as compared to $79 million after-tax in the prior year quarter. ", "As I mentioned, earnings continued to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development which amounted to $199 million pretax this quarter, $86 million higher than the prior year quarter. In business and international insurance, net favorable development of $49 million pretax resulted from better than expected cat and non-cat weather-related losses in our property business for recent accident years, better-than-expected loss experience in GL for 2005 through 2013 and workers\u2019 comp for 2005 and prior and in our Canadian operations, partially offset by a $224 million pretax increase to our asbestos reserves. ", "The asbestos reserve increased related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment is essentially unchanged from recent periods. ", "In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $103 million pretax was concentrated in contract surety and fidelity for 2008 through 2013. Partially driving this favorable development was a reduction in outstanding exposures related to the financial crisis of 2007 and beyond. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $47 million pretax resulted from homeowners and other liability for 2013 and \u201814 and auto liability for 2012 through \u201914. On a combined stat basis for all of our US subs and excluding A&E, there were no accident years or product lines that had any meaningful unfavorable development this quarter or year to date. ", "Third-quarter operating cash flows were very strong at $1.8 billion while holding company liquidity, which included the proceeds from our August 25th issuance of $400 million of 4.3% 30-year senior debt ended the quarter at over $2 billion, well above our target level. The proceeds from this debt issuance will be used towards retiring 400 million of debt that is maturing on December 1 of this year. ", "Our debt to total capital ratio of 23%, or 21.9% adjusted for the retirement of the December 1 maturity was well within its target range and all of our other capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. ", "Net unrealized gains were approximately $2.2 billion pretax or $1.4 billion after-tax, down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to higher rates that were driven by spread widening. Nonetheless book value per share of $79 grew 2% from the beginning of the year and importantly adjusted book value per share of $74.35 which eliminates the impact of unrealized investment gains grew by 5% during this time period. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy we returned $939 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $189 million and common share repurchases of $750 million bringing total capital return to shareholders to almost $2.8 billion year to date. ", "So Brian is now going to discuss underwriting results in business and international insurance. ", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Business and international insurance had a great quarter with excellent returns and production results. Retention remained at a historically high level, the pricing environment was stable and renewal rate change continued to be positive. New business results were solid although as we have discussed previously, new business flow was somewhat lower than we would like as a result of strong retentions across the industry. ", "Turning to the financial results. Operating income for the quarter was strong at $546 million while the combined ratio was 92.2%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior year reserve development was 92.5% for the quarter, an improvement of about 2.5 points year-over-year driven primarily by favorable non-catastrophe weather losses. ", "Looking at the topline, net written premiums for the segment were up a point year-over-year. Domestic business insurance premiums were up 4% driven by changes in the timing and structure of some of our reinsurance treaties in prior quarters which primarily impacted our first party businesses and property lines. ", "Turning to domestic BI production trends, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our very granular pricing strategy. As we have been saying for some time given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention and accordingly we are very pleased that retention remains at 84% for the third quarter in a row. ", "In addition, as Alan mentioned, we continue to seek and are able to get price increases where needed. Overall renewal premium change came in at 3% with renewal rate change consistent with the second quarter. New business of $444 million was down somewhat compared to both the prior year and recent quarters reflecting the market dynamics I mentioned earlier. ", "Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses, the production story is generally consistent with what I just described. I would however bring your attention to other business insurance. As we mentioned last quarter, renewal rate change for this business has turned negative driven by the national property business but even here it\u2019s a very positive overall story with strong returns, retentions in the low 90s and pricing that is slightly negative but stable. Excluding national property, renewal rate change for other business insurance remains positive and down only slightly from the second quarter. ", "Turning to international, net written premiums were down 19% primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign-exchange. Excluding this impact, international net written premiums were down 6% driven by highly competitive market conditions at Lloyd\u2019s reflective of global economic pressure on the marine and energy lines. ", "In terms of production, retention remained strong. Renewal premium change turned slightly negative due to about a 1.5 of negative exposure change resulting from the lower line sizes that we've taken in the Lloyd\u2019s business. The rate change component of renewal premium change was a little more than a point positive. ", "In Canada, renewal premium change continued to be positive. New business was down somewhat quarter over quarter with half of the decline driven by the impact of foreign exchange and the remainder driven by Lloyd\u2019s. So all in, we continue to feel great about the performance across the segment. Returns continue to be attractive and stable and we remain pleased with the granular execution of our strategy. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Doreen. ", "Doreen Spadorcia ", "Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Please forgive me for having a scratchy voice and apologize to all of you. ", "Bond and specialty insurance had another quarter with exceptional financial results. We feel terrific about the fundamentals to drive these results. Disciplined underwriting execution, aggressive management of risk and limits, a continued enhancement of underwriting analytics, strong account and agency relationships and superior claims management. ", "Operating income for the quarter was $196 million, an increase of almost 20% from the third quarter of 2014, driven by better underlying underwriting results and higher net favorable prior year reserve development. Third-quarter underlying combined ratio of 76.1% for the segment improved by 5.6 points from the prior year. About half of this improvement was due to favorable re-estimation of losses in management liability. Underlying underwriting results remained very strong and well within our target. ", "As for topline, net written premiums in the aggregate were up slightly from 2014. Surety was 3% higher primarily attributable to middle-market construction accounts and across our management liability businesses, we drove to higher retention of 87% and improved new business from the prior year quarter. So all in all, another great quarter for bond and specialty. ", "I'll turn now to personal insurance where we once again produced strong underwriting results in both agency auto and agency homeowners and other. We continue to be exceptionally pleased with the growth in our auto book and are very encouraged with the continued momentum we are seeing in homeowners. ", "For the segment, operating income for the quarter was $241 million, a slight increase from the third quarter of 2014. The underlying combined ratio was strong at 85.2% and benefited from generally benign losses in homeowners. On a run rate basis, the segment continues to perform in line with our long-term return goals. ", "Looking specifically at agency auto, we continue to be very pleased with the profitable growth we are generating. Topline results remained strong driven by both new business and retention and underlying margins continue to run in line with expectations and in a range we\u2019re comfortable with. ", "The combined ratio for the quarter was 93.9% and included almost 2.5 points of favorable prior year reserve development. Similar to the last couple of quarters, the favorable prior year reserve development was driven by better-than-expected severity in bodily injury. ", "The underlying combined ratio of 96.2% was essentially flat to the prior year results. As for loss trend, our view of frequency and severity remain consistent with recent quarters. We are certainly aware that there's a lot of discussion in the industry about trend particularly increasing frequency. While we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we currently are not seeing any meaningful change in our overall frequency trend. As always we continue to monitor external data and our own results very closely. But as I said, our view of overall loss trend remains consistent with recent quarters at around 3%. ", "As for agency auto production, retention of 83% has trended up meaningfully from the beginning of 2014 and remains consistent with recent periods. New business premium of $218 million was more than 30% higher than the third quarter of 2014. We continue to grow policies in force which increased by almost 50,000 during the quarter. Net written premiums increased 10% from the prior year quarter. So again by all measures, great results for auto for the quarter. ", "Turning to agency homeowners and others, we once again had strong financial results with an underlying combined ratio of 71.5% driven by benign loss experience both in weather and non-weather. This result is somewhat higher than the prior year quarter due to last year\u2019s losses being even more favorable than this year. Run rate margins in this business remain well within our expectation. ", "As for agency homeowners production, we are very pleased with the progress we're making. New business premiums were up 28% from the prior year quarter and continued to trend favorably while retention remained strong at 84%. Policies in force have leveled off sequentially for the last two quarters and net written premiums when adjusted for the timing and structure of certain reinsurance treaties in prior periods were essentially flat from the prior year quarter. ", "As we said in previous calls, this is an area of high focus for us and we\u2019re encouraged with the positive results we\u2019re seeing to date. So to sum up personal insurance, another great quarter. ", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabi. ", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. We are ready to start the Q&A portion please. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Jay Cohen ", "Just a numbers question, I think you said on the call and I missed. There were some current year development I think in the management liability side. Could you just give me that number again? I am sorry I missed that.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "On the numbers about 10 million, and that\u2019s generally due to fidelity and crime and I will just tell you we had favorable reserve development in prior accident years and that indicated to us that 2015 will perform better than we originally projected. ", "Jay Cohen ", "And then I guess bigger picture on the development which just continues to be such an incredible source of earnings and so resilient. Can you talk maybe broadly, Doreen, about the claims environment, what you\u2019re seeing and what you are not seeing certainly on the liability side? ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "So you are moving out of surety then at this point.", "Jay Cohen ", "Correct. ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Okay. I think we tend to see a pretty stable environment in general liability and there were things that we were thinking might impact that, whether it was people, higher unemployment rate and we might see more liability claims. We thought maybe as people also were in the financial crisis that they thought, we thought jury awards might go up. We didn\u2019t see any of that. So the litigation rates are pretty consistent. We don\u2019t have less or more of that, and it\u2019s performed pretty much I would say better than we thought it would have during the really tough years. For us, in certain lines it\u2019s due to particular things. We have some areas where we have fewer large losses, others we might see the opposite of that but to us, the legal environment has performed pretty well, not what we would have expected politically either. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Larry Greenberg of Janney.", "Larry Greenberg ", "I guess before a question, given that Alan is stepping in very shortly. Jay, I just want to congratulate you on an incredible career and legacy and certainly wish you the best of luck in the future. You\u2019ve been \u2013 you\u2019ve really been a leader for Travelers but also the industry, and have created some phenomenal value for your shareholders and taught a lot of people about the value of prudent capital management and you\u2019ve been generous and patient in answering our sometimes inane questions and certainly sharing your industry insights and I just want to thank you personally for that, and I am sure many others on the call feel the same way. ", "Jay Fishman", "Larry, thank you. I\u2019d say over and over, I have been so fortunate to be surrounded, I am sitting at a table here, with what I think is the most thoughtful, smartest, most committed management team I have ever been around. It\u2019s just extremely quite remarkable when you are surrounded by people like this, it just isn\u2019t nearly as hard as it may seem and so thank you. I\u2019d also tell you that one of the great things that\u2019s been fun for this is there\u2019s a handful of you on the call and there\u2019s a couple in the room here but there is a few people that we have been speaking to right from the very beginning, I was doing the arithmetic this morning, I think this is my 56th earnings call and there is a few of you who have been there right from the beginning, and it\u2019s been great fun to work with people over that period of time, just a real great joy actually in watching how people can change their view of the business and how the business has changed. So thank you for the comment, I most appreciate it. Nobody else follow up please with that. That\u2019s the last thank you we will get but Larry, thanks. Go ahead with your question. ", "Larry Greenberg ", "I know you talked a bit about Quantum and maybe it\u2019s nothing more than, it just continues to develop traction in the marketplace. But it seems like the traction is more than certainly I would have expected at this point. And I am just wondering if you could give some more color on what\u2019s really happening, where the rubber meets the road, what\u2019s the feedback from the agents, is it simply that in more time you are getting more traction or anything you could share on that would be helpful for me?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Sure. This is Doreen and good morning. I think that it\u2019s fair to say that it\u2019s gotten more traction quicker than even we thought and Alan commented on that. We did a lot of work before we designed the product looking at what we thought it needed to be from a pricing standpoint before we started modelling it and looking at, on what expenses needed to take out. Along with that, we have a really, I would say, gifted sales force that is out with agents every day talking about the products. We\u2019ve also introduced some sales marketing toolkits that allows agents to regularly reach out to prospective customers. I think the agents \u2013 I am a little biased in this \u2013 I think the agents really want to do business with us and we gave them a competitive product and a quality product that allow them to do that. ", "And I think the other really exciting thing about it is that the agents are also seeing as they are picking up a bigger share from the captive and the direct market which is what we hope would happen for them, so they just didn\u2019t see that they were getting a lower commission, so they see that net, net, they are getting into markets that they might not have been successful and they are producing more volume and the feedback has been very good. We meet with them very very often and I think that\u2019s probably \u2013 it\u2019s just worked as we hoped it would. ", "Larry Greenberg ", "Do you think that the issues that some in the industry are having with frequency might be additionally creating some opportunities for you?", "Jay Fishman", "No, Larry, it\u2019s Jay. I can\u2019t think of a topic that we\u2019ve spent more time trying to understand ourselves and as obviously we are anticipating someone asking, why don\u2019t you think you are experiencing some of the frequency trends that are bizarre, and the truth is that we don\u2019t know. But I\u2019d make the following observations. One is that where you start from is an important assumption. These are \u2013 we are talking about changes in frequency from period to period and so one of the interesting questions is always how good are those original estimates from which you are adjusting, was there a pattern or trend that evidenced itself, later, sooner but so the starting point matters and it can\u2019t be dismissed. The other which I find more than intriguing, there is a tendency to assume, analysts in particular, that the auto insurance customers the equivalent of a monolith there. They are all the same. And we know definitively in the data, that\u2019s just not the case. And we know that for example from our experience of being the GEICO partner for as many years as we have been, the customers that buy directly are on average, now it doesn\u2019t mean that we are on lots of exceptions but on average they are younger, more single, more single cars, more minimum limits, they are a different driver than a higher end older, importantly older driver, the sort of type that was typically been a Travelers customer. So you can speculate and it\u2019s all it is, is it possible that distracted driving is impacting that younger group disproportionately relative to the older drivers. Is it possible that as employment has improved and miles driven increased, that the unemployment improved amongst the younger drivers at a faster rate than older because they have not come down as much, and as a consequence you are seeing \u2013 and this is hypothesis, not a fact, that you are seeing an increase in miles in the group that tends to have a higher rate of frequency. So that\u2019s the best we can offer at the moment. Those two dynamics of who\u2019s the driver and what\u2019s changed in their world and they are quite different and then what\u2019s the starting point from which they are coming. ", "I think Doreen had it exactly right \u2013 I had a conversation a couple of years ago with an agent and it\u2019s just one. He was using Quantum 2 to do outbound calling to those customers that Travelers had the homeowners on but someone else had the auto. And so he was out there reaching out and saying look, we\u2019ve got a product that\u2019s lower rate than the old Travelers was and you put the two products together and you\u2019ve got the combined product discount, and suddenly that quote for the auto retained remarkably compelling for a meaningful number of customers out there. So sort of one of the surprises was the account rounding that took place around Quantum and that certainly added to the volume. So it started off with really hard management work of reducing costs, tough stuff, tough to execute locally, hard meaning things, and then having a product that could compete with the marketplace that exists today, the core reality of making sure you are not \u2013 you\u2019re relevant in a changing marketplace. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein.", "Josh Stirling ", "So I was hoping you could talk a little bit about pricing and you guys have done a good job of laying out a really interesting phenomenon in the other business insurance line, it\u2019s just a huge difference between property and your overall renewal rate changes and if you sort of observe from 50,000 feet, it looks like most of your renewal rate changes across lot of line to kind of like ending up in 1% or 2% sort of positive and not as much as that was a couple of years ago phenomenon, in other business insurance which I think you will correct me, but I think this is national account and more specialty and wholesale stuff, obviously is declining now for the past couple of quarters and I am wondering if you could sort of talk a little bit about what\u2019s structurally different about this business relative to some of the other sort of more small, bit more commercial personal line things, if it is and if we can sort of understand that and sort of as we get better into forecasting it. But then also perhaps even more technically, is this something that\u2019s really just a phenomenon of the property pressures that are coming from sort of changes in the reinsurance market and then ultimately, almost if you reframe that, is it not as a question of pricing but is a question of margins, would you guys think yourselves as letting property business today at a stable margin but perhaps with less total price?", "Jay Fishman", "Josh, Alan and I are going to tatting this. First, I\u2019d make the observation that to the extent that capital \u2013 new capital comes into our industry, it comes into those areas that are easiest to put capital to work quickly. So you will often find it in large account business where frequency \u2013 claims frequency is not an issue, you will find it in unregulated \u2013 not as middle market in this \u2013 so capital goes where it can be most easily deployed and the large account property business is a really good example of an area where capital can be committed pretty easily without much infrastructure for regulatory hoops to go through. Now there is something in particular about the national property business and Alan talked about that, but first, we start off with an industry phenomena, to the extent new capital is coming in, that\u2019s an area. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Josh, it\u2019s Alan. Let me start with \u2013 we\u2019re just getting a little bit of perspective on your commentary. You said that ex the national property, I think it was zero to 1 and I would say that\u2019s not exactly true. There is a range from a little bit negative on national property to say the auto lines where it\u2019s a challenge from a return perspective and we\u2019re getting rate in excess of loss trend there. So I would just encourage you not to think about the whole book being at a zero or 1 but they are being a range that really corresponds to profitability. Also in terms of what\u2019s in that business, it\u2019s certainly our national property but there is really no casualty in that business at all, it\u2019s national property, it\u2019s boiler, inland, ocean, so just to be clear about what\u2019s in it. ", "You made the comment about returns but the returns in that national property business are very very attractive. And so I would say that the pressure that we are seeing from price really is coming from two places, there probably is a component of \u2013 that\u2019s an easy place for the incremental capital coming into the business to find a home but also the returns are very very good, and so we continue to have very high retentions and to grow that business. ", "Josh Stirling ", "So if I can ask a final question and obviously the past decade or so of Travelers has been one of capital returns and discipline, and that\u2019s been fantastic for shareholders, to the credit of everybody on the call. But the trade-off from that obviously naturally is that there are some other companies have chosen different approaches where they basically retain earnings and they grow through acquisition or other sources. And I am wondering as you guys look sort of from where you are today as you look forward, think about the next five or 10 years, and think about other companies getting bigger and the importance I presume of Travelers even maintaining its market share as sort of a number one or number two player with all of your agencies. I am wondering how your strategic calculus might change in sort of more of a focus on growth to keep up with [indiscernible] something we should anticipate from Travelers?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Josh, let me take that too and let me start by saying and I said these words before, Jay has really managed this through on ensemble cast. So everyone around this table I think feels like we are contributing authors to the strategy that we put in place in that we\u2019ve implemented and executed over the years, and we\u2019re also very very comfortable that what we\u2019ve done has created enormous shareholder value, and so we will continue to be return focused and I would encourage you to all look at the first slide that we put in the webcast every single quarter, quarter in, quarter out, and we spent a lot of time looking at that internally. I would \u2013 if you go back 10 years, and you look at \u2013 and Jay has actually put up the slide before, look at the way we\u2019ve deployed capital, we have grown and we do \u2013 we would certainly rather grow than not grow and we\u2019ve deployed capital where we think we can and grow at attractive returns. So if you look at commercial accounts over the years, or you look at the surety business when the credit environment allowed us to do it, there is all sorts of examples in all different time periods across all of our businesses when we\u2019ve grown, and we will continue to make every effort to do that when we can. We understand that there is a relevance to market share and scale, so we are not indifferent to it, and we will hopefully make the right judgments in balancing the way we manage the business for returns and thinking about the relevance of growth and scale over time. ", "Jay Fishman", "And I would just add that in the context of acquisitions, we\u2019ve been actively engaged with anything that\u2019s transpired, we have looked at, we\u2019ve established views of value and where value can be created, and points at which it can be and if we would have find the transaction, that would fit strategically, that would enable us to either reduce the volatility of our own returns or potentially even improve them and of course, that\u2019s hard being the highest return competitor in the industry, but if we can find that, we\u2019re not uncomfortable moving ahead, where we have done a few transactions in our lives and feel that we have got the skill base to execute and so we will always keep looking. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley.", "Kai Pan ", "Thank you. I had to say, Jay, congratulations on a great career ending on such a high note. And then for Alan, I think seeing the announcement, I wonder you must have gave some thoughts on your priorities or where do you see area you can further improve the organization. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thanks for the question, Kai. Certainly been thinking a lot about it and I guess I would go back to where I started with the last question which is we\u2019ve all been managing this and we\u2019ve all been on this trajectory and talked together and we will continue to do that. I mean it\u2019s a really fortunate position at the moment as I said at the opening of the call, not just that I am stepping into terrific results but I am stepping into a very familiar situation. So the management team, the strategy, the board, all of that\u2019s really familiar and that gives me a great opportunity to be thoughtful and very deliberate and to take my time together with the rest of the team as we think about what\u2019s next. So we will do that in due course and this has really given me an opportunity over the last couple of months to spend time with the leadership team to be on the road with our field organizations, to spend time with distribution, so it\u2019s been really a luxury and a privilege and we will take the time to be thoughtful and deliberate about it. ", "Kai Pan ", "And follow up question, on your year-over-year improvement on the underlying margin, you said the lower non-cat loss has contributed to that. My understanding is that last year third quarter you have above normal and I don't know if this year's like below normal of non-cat activities and could you quantify that? Just wonder, going forward, we see this year's level would be more normalized non-cat weather events. ", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. I mean as you\u2019ve heard us say on the call before, we\u2019ve always struggled with the concept of what actually is normal, and what we do in our Qs and Ks is \u2013 for weather \u2013 for other things, we do know what is normal. But when it comes to weather, what we are doing in our Qs and Ks is really making comparisons of actual cost in one quarter to actual cost in another, so you do hear us talk about this was more favorable than last year or this was less favorable than last year but to try to quantify in any meaningful way, how that then compares to what\u2019s normal is difficult. What we do try to provide is some color to say that the weather seemed to be fairly benign this quarter. So I think we would say that whatever normal is, is probably a little more expensive than what we saw this quarter but we leave it to you to actually try to dollarize that if you will.", "Kai Pan ", "Well, just year over year comparison, if you look relative basis, like how much that contribute to the 240 basis points?", "Jay Benet", "Well just look at it a year to year basis, it was primarily a change due to the level of non-cat weather in BI. And that\u2019s what we try to communicate hopefully clearly in the Q and the press release. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse.", "Ryan Tunis ", "My first question, I guess, is just given the 10-year back at 2%, how should we think about the NII run rate on the fixed income portfolio headed into next year as it compares to this year? Also, how should we be thinking about alternative returns headed into fourth quarter with, I guess, probably some lagged odds on PE, especially given energy? ", "Jay Benet", "We try to be very clear in our Q and the outlook as to what\u2019s taking place in the fixed income environment and we don\u2019t try to make predictions of the future interest rates, we more or less look at it on a basis of its today\u2019s rates or to maintain themselves over the next 12 months or so, what\u2019s the likely impact of that on the reinvestment capabilities for assets that are turning over in that timeframe, and based upon that, we\u2019ve made a disclosure in the Q saying that on a quarterly basis we would expect the fixed income NII all things being equal to go down about $25 million to $30 million from where it would have been in the prior year quarter on a comparative basis. And that would be an aftertax number. And that\u2019s frankly consistent with not only what we have been saying but more or less what we have been seeing over the last several years, if you followed what\u2019s taken place in our fixed income portfolio. ", "As it relates to the non-fixed income portfolio, we do report private equities on a three month lag basis, we report hedge funds on a one month lag basis, so it\u2019s not quite the same in terms of the time differential and from our own forecasting standpoint, we do our best to look forward and try to determine based on equity markets and not just the private equities and hedge funds, but what the real estate markets are doing because that\u2019s a substantial portion of the non-fixed income portfolio and we try to internally estimate what we think fourth quarter and into next quarter returns are going to be but we don\u2019t have a crystal ball, so when people ask me what we think, I try to guide them to look at the past several quarters and draw some conclusions from that as to what kind of trajectory we might be on. If you look, last year versus this year, we did disclose that the repricing of oil worldwide had an impact on our valuations and that\u2019s worked its way through the valuations at this point in time. So other than that, there\u2019s really nothing more I can think of adding to that. ", "Ryan Tunis ", "And then I just had two quick number questions on FPI. And my first one, I think, is a follow-up on Jay Cohen's question on the current accident year favorable development and I think Doreen mentioned it was in fidelity and crime. I'm wondering should we think about that as a change in trend that will, all things being equal, also be a tailwind headed into next year? ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "My answer to that is no. It's really more of a factor of what we've seen in prior accident years and that influencing what we think 2015 would be. So, no, we would not view that as a trend going forward in \u201816. ", "Ryan Tunis ", "And then the other one for FPI was just looking at the general admin expenses, they were down about $6 million to $10 million this quarter from where we've seen the run rate. Is this a good run rate going forward or is that one-time, that $93 million? ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "You're speaking to the intangible that was fully amortized, so that's a one-time event, yes, in the second quarter, is that what we were talking about? ", "Jay Benet", "Yes, if you talk about bond and specialty, the reduction in expenses that you are referring to, there was an intangible that became fully amortized and as a result, that expense now goes away. It continues to go away. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Nannizzi ", "So just returning to auto for just a second, if I could, I guess not being an operator, trying to see inside the operating lens a little bit, it looks like you're increasing rate and growing as a result of Quantum 2.0. This frequency dynamic has popped up elsewhere that you guys haven't seen. It's still not clear what's underneath that. How do you sort of balance the goal of repositioning auto via Quantum 2.0 and being top three traders and growing at a pace you're comfortable with, but doing that in a changing loss environment and whether that creates the risk of adverse selection? ", "Jay Fishman", "It\u2019s Jay Fishman. Just two or three observations, after he wants to add in. One is if you set higher rate that\u2019s 2.0 versus 1.0, it\u2019s actually a lower rate, in other words the 2.0, again you get all sorts of sales that are different and different underwriting elements but the concept behind 2.0 was across the board a lower priced product than 1.0 was, 1.0 in a comparative rating environment was not nearly competitive enough, 2.0 was designed to be substantially more competitive and that actually has happened. The volume and the product is a function of how it shows up on a technology platform in an agent\u2019s office and in that regard, 2.0 was doing exactly what we had hoped it would. As to the changing loss environment, I am not sure we could look any harder than we looked, for us it hasn\u2019t happened, we could and so we just keep going on. Whether it\u2019s in losses, incurred losses, early indicators of losses, early indicators of activity, there\u2019s just been not a meaningful change and I don\u2019t mean to hammer hard that, because any quarter numbers move a little up or down, all the time. But in looking for something systemic, we just don\u2019t see it here. So those are the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, Doreen, if you want to -- ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I would like to add, we do expect when we add new business, that that\u2019s going to perform at least initially at a higher loss ratio and that as that becomes more tenured, it begins to perform in the range of where our tenured business is. So when we have said that everything is in line with our expectations, that\u2019s exactly what we mean, we assume certain things about how the book to new business will perform, and it\u2019s within those garb rails, we just started going through our renewal cycle with the first of the Quantum book, we expect that to even perform at lower levels of loss but within planned expectations. So I agree with Jay, we are not seeing anything that\u2019s systemic in the environment but our view of new business is it gets to the returns over time and we expect it ---", "Jay Fishman", "I would just add because it\u2019s something we take for granted here, I often find there is confusion. There is no difference in the price between a new account and a renewal account. They are the same and so when Doreen says that a block of new business doesn\u2019t perform as well as once it\u2019s seasoned, it\u2019s not because the rate changes, it\u2019s because the underwriting improves with performance. As you begin to understand the dynamics of each individual account, you can begin to make adjustments all the way from lowering rate where someone has earned it, increasing rate where someone has earned that, or non-renewing where the circumstances warranted, and so the improvement with age is not about a new business penalty, the phrase is often used, it\u2019s really about the unseasoned underwriting performance that occurs in any new block of business in any business and improves with time. ", "Michael Nannizzi ", "I guess my question, when I mentioned rate increase I was looking at the renewal premium change. So I guess what you're saying is that the cost reductions that you made, including the commission reductions, are enough to even make the premium lower in 2.0 versus what it would have been in 1.0 despite the fact that you've got renewal premium change? ", "Jay Fishman", "Exactly right. And so the renewal premium change is positive and obviously some of that, a meaningful amount of that is still Quantum 1 that\u2019s on the books, and where Quantum 2 is, is entirely our new business now but there is a insignificant amount of Quantum 1 that continues its aging, its meaningfully profitable does quite well. Now that obviously will \u2013 the Quantum 1 percentage will go down with time, the Quantum 2 in the portfolio will go up but you\u2019ve got it exactly right. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS.", "Brian Meredith ", "Yes, thanks, two questions here. First one, Doreen, I noticed in the 10-Q that you've changed your outlook for underlying margins in the personal line sub-segment to go from kind of stable going to \u201816 to now I guess smaller margins. What's behind that change? ", "Doreen Spadorcia ", "Brian, that's really as the amount of the Quantum business comes in. ", "Brian Meredith ", "So expectation is still pretty strong growth in Quantum, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s just better than expected.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Brian, it\u2019s Gabi. Are you talking to all of PI or was that specifically auto \u2013", "Brian Meredith ", "It\u2019s all personal lines, when you look at all personal lines, make that overall kind of general comment. ", "Brian MacLean", "It\u2019s a combination of the new business and Quantum is \u2013 Jay and Doreen just talked about, that impact as well as the whole concept of what the weather in that might be.", "Brian Meredith ", "It\u2019s good solid weather in the third quarter, so kind of looking forward. Okay. That makes sense. The second question, just quickly, and maybe I'm reading too much into this, is looking into your exposure in business insurance, it continued to kind of moderate here, exposure increases. Anything to read into that? ", "Alan Schnitzer", "No, Brian, it\u2019s Alan. I would say generally reflective of economic conditions. ", "Brian Meredith ", "Okay. So you're seeing economic conditions to may be slowing a little bit? ", "Alan Schnitzer", "No, we are seeing \u2013 ", "Jay Fishman", "We are trying \u2013 that we are all looking at each other trying to understand what to look, what you are seeing and reacting to. ", "Brian Meredith ", "Just looking at business insurance. If I look at -- you provide the exposure other as a percentage. It's been moderating over the last year. Small business you definitely saw it come down as far as the rate of increase. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Pretty small numbers you are looking at. So if you are looking at selective, sequentially it\u2019s 4.9 to 4.1, if you are looking it overall BI, it\u2019s national, it\u2019s something like 2.4 to 2.2, so you\u2019re really talking very small changes in the number that is hard to even calculate with any precision. ", "Brian MacLean", "And Brian, this is Brian MacLean. Remember that that in the production statistics those are really the underwriter, and the account and the producers estimate of what\u2019s going to happen with the exposures going forward. So it\u2019s a little bit of what gets pushed into the price, then there is also audit premium which is come into the actual premium line which has been a little bit higher. So the actual exposures we are seeing are pretty consistent. ", "Jay Fishman", "And typically as it ages it goes up, but the audit premium gets reflected and so the natural trend is for a customer to under-estimate perspective exposure to save rates and then of course the audit brings it back up and comes in later. So there is a bit of \u2013 I wouldn\u2019t call it seasonality time of year, but time may associate with it. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays.", "Jay Gelb ", "I want to follow up on the M&A environment and I know there's some previous commentary around in what circumstances Travelers might be interested in doing a deal. I wanted to see if you could tailor those comments a bit more towards international versus domestic. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure, Jay, it\u2019s Alan. I will take that. So we would apply the same kind of thought process and lens to a transaction outside the US as we would to the US, either it\u2019s going to contribute to our mission of improving returns or creating more profit dollars at the same returns or improving volatility. And so we would apply the same lens and go through the same thought process. A transaction outside the United States given our footprint and our scale may be different in that analysis than one would be in the US, so that\u2019s why a $1 billion transaction in Canada for instance was so attractive to us, a $1 billion transaction in the US would certainly less strategic from that perspective. So we will continue to look in our existing and beyond footprint outside the US and we will undertake transactions when they make sense on that basis. ", "Jay Gelb ", "Thanks for that. And then on the premium growth for the quarter, gross written premiums up 0.6%, net up 2.6%. So am I right in assuming that it was purchasing less reinsurance was a main driver of the net growth or was there something else there? ", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. In prior quarters, we made some changes to our reinsurance, it was not that we were purchasing less reinsurance but you will recall earlier in the year we talked about changing our cat cover which previously had been on July 1 renewal and we cancelled it as of 12/31. This was the gen cat, cancelled it as of 12/31 last year and on January 1 of this year bought the gen cat cumulative cover. So what you have in this particular quarter is a comparison to a quarter last year where we had a purchase of reinsurance, this year we didn\u2019t have it but the same kind of cover with a different set of limits and different types of aggregation, was done in January 1. All that said, if you want to get a better view of things without looking at the reinsurance, look at year to date information because it washes itself out. There were some other similar types of changes, some in terms of timing, some gone from quota share to excess cover but we really haven\u2019t fundamentally changed the program. ", "Jay Gelb ", "So the year to date net written premium growth trends, should it probably be a better indicator?", "Jay Benet", "Yes.", "Jay Fishman", "Just one additional thought, again we take for granted you so often -- your acquisition question. We are a small and middle market insurance company, we are a very big one. But we are small and middle market company, we really don\u2019t for substantive reasons aspire to be a globally account casualty underwriter. It\u2019s a different business, it\u2019s not one that we are particularly well suited, we really don\u2019t do it in the US in any meaningful way. And so all these questions about international acquisitions and they are relevant, really we get very local focused, what can we do in a particular geography that we are talking about as opposed to how does it allow us to write global casualty for a fortune 10 company, that\u2019s just not our business, not what we do. So we tend to think of it as quite local and not a global in that sense. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie.", "Amit Kumar ", "Thanks for fitting me in. Just one question, a clarification question. In response to Larry's question I think you mentioned that you're capturing more share in the captive and direct channels. And I was trying to figure out, that's a different shopping experience and why would a captive policyholder be willing to move their auto policy to an independent agent I guess given the lack of a bundling discount? Maybe just explain that a bit more to me. ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "I mean I don't know exactly why they might switch from one to the other, but they have more choice. If they're with a captive agent they have a product and that's it and if they start shopping around, which we know many more customers are shopping, then they might choose a different distribution channel so that they can have choice. ", "Jay Fishman", "The data is that I'm thinking about is quite dated. I know we have information, of course it's self disclosed where the customer tells us their previous insurer was and I'm going back quite a ways. But it has been -- it has long-standing been predominantly captive companies and other direct companies moving into the independent agent channel disproportionate of our new business rather than -- there's obviously one agent company moving to us, but disproportionately more captive and direct as a percentage of that volume. I haven't looked at that in a couple of years but that's at least what the standard has been. ", "Doreen Spadorcia", "And we've seen more of it with 2.0", "End of Q&A", "Gabriella Nawi", "Very good. That will conclude our call for today. As always, we are available in investor relations for any follow up questions. Thank you very much and have a great day.

Welcome to the Fourth Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 21, 2016.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Tina. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2015 fourth quarter and full year results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement, and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, CEO, Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance.", "They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions. In addition, Jay Fishman and other members of the Senior Management team are also in the room.", "Before I turn it over to Alan, I would like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements.", "Also in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabi. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. We are very pleased to finish 2015 with another strong quarter. As I'm sure you've seen, we reported operating income of $886 million or $2.90 per share and operating return on equity of 15.8%.", "That caps off another terrific year with operating income of just over $3.4 billion, operating income per diluted share of a record high $10.87 and operating return on equity of 15.2%.", "Our underwriting results across the board remains strong as you can see from our combined ratio of 86.6% for the quarter and 88.3% for the year.", "In domestic business insurance consistent with our marketplace objectives, we achieved a record level of retention in the quarter with positive renewal rate change. In Bond & Specialty Insurance, we generated an all time best underlying combined ratio of 80.1% for the year. Broadly speaking, the market dynamics in the commercial insurance marketplace continued to be remarkably stable.", "In personal lines, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations. In agency auto, we had year-over-year policy in force growth of 8% in the fourth quarter, and as you can see in the webcast that's the sixth consecutive sequential quarter of increasing discount. Those of you who have been following our agency auto know what a success it has been.", "We are also pleased to be seeing an impact from the success of Quantum Auto 2.0 in our homeowners business, and you'll hear more about that from Doreen.", "Jay Benet will have more to say about our current investment results, but I\u2019ll just note that we have delivered pretty exceptional returns on equity for quite some time notwithstanding over the headwinds in the investment arena. Historically, low interest rates, the decline in energy prices, and volatility in the equity markets just is examples from this quarter.", "This speaks volumes about our ability to select in price underwriting risk and the strength of our insurance franchises. Just as a data point, our after-tax net investment income is about $1 billion lower in 2015 as compared to its high in 2007.", "On the other hand, our after-tax underlying underwriting margin is about $1 billion higher in 2015, than it was at its low in 2011. Particularly to the extent the fixed income yields remain low and that seems like the outlook for at least some time. And with capital finding its way into the largest end of this business, expertise and generating underwriting returns and having strong franchises in the smaller middle marketplaces with meaningful barriers to entry will really matter.", "Turning to capital management, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned nearly $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders in the quarter and nearly $4 billion during the year. For long time consistent strength of our results since behind our capital management strategy.", "Just as we have for nearly a decade, we will continue to right size capital and invest profitably in the business. Things to that strategy we have now returned close to $35 billion of capital to shareholders since the middle of 2006 when we started our share repurchase program.", "Let me take just a minute to comment on the leadership transition. What I suspect many of you want to hear from me is where do go from here? As I've explained to our leadership team, our challenge is this, to take today's summit and make it tomorrow's base camp.", "I'm confident that we already have the right strategy in place to do that and we've got the right team to execute it. We've been executing it. We understand it and it has been remarkably successful. It's this team's strategy.", "Delivering superior returns overtime will continue to be our North Star. We'll do that by investing in and leveraging our competitive advantages, delivering industry-leading products and services, and making sure this is a great place to work for the best talent in this industry.", "That's not to say that we won't challenge ourselves constantly to make sure that both the strategy and the way we are executing on it remains relevant. It's critical that we reassess all the time and we will continue to be a leader in evolving and innovating, particularly given the potential for change around this. Among other things, we'll continue to refine our data and analytics to make sure that we lead in reselection and pricing.", "We'll continue to innovate on the product side and our claim in risk control organizations to make sure that we're delivering at the forefront for agents, brokers and customers. And we'll continue to build on our leading position with our distribution partners to make sure that we're partner of choice for them. We've always understood the value of size and scale and we're well-positioned in that regard.", "Just as in the past, we'll seek opportunities to grow thoughtfully and in ways that contribute to shareholder value. And as always, we'll manage our expenses thoughtfully. All of that is business as usual for us. Our confidence in our strategy and our track record in executing on it give us confidence in our ability to continue to deliver for our shareholders.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Alan. As Alan mentioned, we're very pleased with our results this quarter; net income per diluted share of $2.83, operating income per diluted share $2.90 and an operating ROE of 15.8%.", "These results were driven by the continuation of our very strong current accident year underwriting performance as evidenced by an underlying combined ratio of 90.7% despite relatively high non-cat weather related losses in the quarter.", "Net favorable prior year reserve development was very strong at $292 million pretax and cat losses were relatively modest at $46 million pretax. That said, as shown on Page 4 of the webcast, current quarter results were lower than our very strong fourth quarter of 2014 results, mostly due to the impact of low interest rates and private equity returns on net investment income and in even higher amount of net favorable prior year reserve development in the prior year quarter.", "Underlying underwriting margins were pretty much the same in both quarters. Fixed income NII of $422 million after-tax was down $31 million from the prior year quarter, principally due to what we have been saying for many years.", "Securities has had higher book yields have gone off during the past 12 months and have been replaced with securities having lower yields due to the current low interest rate environment.", "Another contributing factor to lower fixed income NII was the modest reduction in average investments that resulted in part from the company's $579 million first quarter 2015 payment to settle the Asbestos Direct Action Litigation.", "Looking forward based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect to the impact of lower reinvestment yields and a lower level of fixed maturity investments could in 2016 result in approximately $20 million to $25 million of lower after-tax NII on a quarterly basis when compared to the corresponding periods of 2015.", "Non-fixed income NII of $25 million after tax was down $42 million from the prior year quarter, primarily due to lower private equity returns. Private equities essential broke even this quarter as compared to earning $30 million after tax in the prior year quarter due to lower valuations for energy-related investments.", "Each of our business segments continue to benefit from net favorable prior year reserve development and business in international insurance, net favorable development of $176 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2014. In general, liability for both primary and excess coverage\u2019s for accident years 2012 and prior and then the company's operations in Canada.", "In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $80 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience and fidelity ensured date, for rest of the years 2012 through 2014. And in personal insurance, net favorable development of $36 million pretax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in auto liability for accident years 2013 and 14 and in homeowners and other liability for accident year 2014.", "As I have done in the past, I'd also like to provide you with some insight into what our combined 2015 scheduled peak is expected to share when it's filed on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years in the aggregate across all product lines are expected to develop favorably and all that one product line on scheduled peak are expected to develop either favorably or show very modest or de minimis unfavorable development.", "The product line that is expected to develop unfavorably by approximately $50 million free tax is products liability occurrence but another product line other liability occurrence will have an offsetting amount of favorable development as we've refined our allocation of IBNR between these two components of general liability based upon how losses, such as those related to construction defect have been developing by coverage type.", "In total, our general liabilities were not - general liability reserves were not affected by this action. Returning to GAAP for the year we had net favorable development of $941 million pretax with approximately $840 million coming from our U.S. ops and a little over $100 million coming from our Canadian and U.K. operations.", "There are two additional topics I'd like to update you on. As shown on Page 21 on the webcast, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL Treaty effective January 1. The treaty provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence.", "It keeps the same broad parallel and geographic coverage in the same positioning of the coverage layer providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the reduction and cost are quite small in relation to our operating income.", "The second topic relates to the recent drop in oil prices. Page 22 of the webcast contains updated information showing the magnitude of our investments in below investment-grade energy bonds and energy-related equities. And you can see that some of these investments is relatively small and the exposure is quite manageable.", "Operating cash flows remain strong, $760 million in the fourth quarter after making a $100 million discretionary contribution to our qualified pension plan bringing total operating cash flows to over $3.4 billion for the year.", "We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategies as you heard from Alan. We returned to almost $1.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $183 million and common share repurchases of a little over $1 billion.", "For the full year, we returned almost $4 billion of excess capital to our shareholders through dividends of $744 million and common share repurchases of over $3.2 billion.", "Holding company liquidly ended the year at $1.6 billion, well above our target level and our debt-to-total capital ratio, which was 23% at the beginning of the quarter slightly elevated due to our having issued $400 million of debt in the third quarter to prefund $400 million of debt that was maturing in the fourth quarter, has come back down to 22.1% well within its target range with the retirement of that debt.", "Net unrealized investment gains were almost $2 billion pretax or $1.3 billion after tax, which was down from $3 billion and $2 billion respectively at the beginning of the year due to an increase in interest rates and spreads.", "Book value per share of $79.75 grew 3% from the beginning of the year and importantly adjusted book value per share of $75.39, which eliminates the after tax impact of net unrealized investment gains grew by 6% this year.", "So with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks Jay. Business in international insurance results for both the fourth quarter and the full year was strong. We continue to generate excellent returns with a full year combined ratio of 92.1% and our retention throughout the year was very strong and reached a record level this quarter in our domestic business.", "Pricing trends remained relatively consistent with renewal rate change still slightly positive at the end of the year, while new business volume in our domestic business saw a modest increase.", "Turning to the quarter's financial results, operating income was $566 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89.6. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development was 94.4%, up a half a point compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to a higher level of non- cat weather related losses.", "Looking at the topline, net written premiums for the quarter were down about 1.5 points compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 with domestic business insurance premiums up about a point.", "In domestic business insurance we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. As we've been saying for some time, given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business our focus continues to be on retention and accordingly we\u2019re very pleased that retention improved to a record 85% in the quarter.", "Renewal premium change came in at 2.4 points, while renewal rate change remained positive but down slightly versus the third quarter. New business of $476 million was up compared to both the prior year and the third quarter.", "Looking at each of our individual domestic businesses beginning with Select, rate in renewal premium change were in line with recent quarters while retention remains strong at 82% demonstrating continued stability in this segment of the market.", "In the middle market, we achieved record retention of 88%, overall rate change was about flat and reflected a decline of about a point from the third quarter. As we've always said, the execution below the headline numbers is what matters and we continue to see a great about the granular results.", "Retention for our best performing business was just over 90% within average rate decline of less than 2% on those accounts, while for our poor performing business we continued to get a rate in excess of loss trend.", "In terms of exposure, the quarter's results include a drag of about a point from our oil and gas business resulting from reduced economic activity due to lower energy prices. Just as a reference point, our oil and gas business makes up only about 3% of domestic business insurance written premium. Middle market new business of $254 million was up from the third quarter and in line with the prior year.", "In other business insurance retention was strong at 80%, renewal rate change was about flat even after being negatively impacted by our national property business. As I mentioned last quarter,", "although national property is seeing the largest rate declines of any business in our portfolio, we are pleased with the overall performance of this business.", "Returns and retention remains strong and pricing trends are stable. Excluding national property, renewal rate change for other business insurance remains positive and was relatively stable with the third quarter.", "Turning to international, net written premiums were down about 16% for the quarter and 14% for the full year primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rate. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums for the fourth quarter were down about 6% largely driven by declines in retention in Canada and to a lesser extent at Lloyd's.", "International retention was down in the quarter to 79%, however renewal premium change was slightly positive and new business for the quarter was very strong at $80 million up 18% year-over-year.", "In Canada, our competitive renewal environment adversely impacted retention across our book. However in June, we launched Optima, our new strategic insurance platform in Canada for personal insurance. Optima was modeled after our U.S. based Quantum Auto 2.0. product. We\u2019re in the early days of the roll-out but are pleased with the initial response as we are seeing a significant increase in new business volume.", "In Lloyd\u2019s, we continue to see a challenging markets resulting from global economic conditions particularly in our marine business. Offsetting this pressure, our two new business products that we have recently launched focused on renewable energy and global construction and early returns are encouraging.", "So all in for the segment, it was a terrific 2015 with strong financial results and what we see as a remarkably stable environment when our competitive advantages really matter to our customers and agents. ", "Before I turn it over to Doreen, I want to make one comment on our outlook for operating margins which we include in our quarterly fillings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect our 2016 underlying underwriting margins for the segment will be broadly consistent with 2015. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers.", "With that, let me turn it over to Doreen.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Thank you, Brian and good morning everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance finished 2015 with another quarter of exceptional financial results. Operating income for the quarter was 162 million down from the fourth quarter of 2014 due to lower net favorable prior year reserve development but overall still a great result.", "The underlying combined ratio of 80.7 was three point, four points better than the prior year quarter due primarily to two factors, a modest increase in a loss ratio in the prior year quarter that resulted from a re-estimation of the first three quarters of 2014, and secondly the impact of certain customer related intangible assets which became fully amortized during the second quarter of 2015.", "Underlying underwriting results continue to run well within our long term target ranges and as Alan mentioned, the full year underlying combined ratio of 80.1 was an all time best. We obviously don't think these results come by accident. We pride ourselves on maintaining the underwriting discipline, aggressive management of risk and limits, strong accountant and agency relationship, analytics and claims management that drive these results. ", "As we look ahead to 2016 for this segment, we expect underlying underwriting margin to remain broadly consistent with 2015. As for top line net written premiums in the aggregate were down 4% from the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decline in surety volume driven by lower bonding needs for our accounts particularly as compared to the strong production in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Surety production can vary significantly quarter-over-quarter based on the number, size and timing of bonded construction projects awarded to our customers. We have a strong portfolio of surety clients and believe we remain well positioned to capitalize on increased bonding needs that might result from an improved economy.", "Across our management liability businesses, retention remains strong at 85% while new business premium was up 17% from the fourth quarter of 2014. Renewal premium changed trended down with lower rate being partially offset by an increase in other RPC which includes changes in the size of insured exposures, in the midst written attachment point and policy duration. The lower rate was as expected and is consistent with the strong profitability of our portfolio. So all-in-all, another great quarter closing a strong year for Bond & Specialty Insurance.", "I'll turn now to personal insurance where we closed out the year with another quarter of exceptional underwriting results. So the segment operating income for the quarter was 222 million and the underlying combined ratio was 86.2%. Great results and as we move forward the segment remains positioned to perform in line with our long term return growth.", "I'll touch on the quarterly results for agency auto and agency property in a moment but first I\u2019d like to share with you some thoughts on how we view the underlying health of these businesses. First for auto, I\u2019ll start by saying how pleased we are with the vibrancy of our auto business. The market response from both agents and consumers to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains incredibly strong and the portfolio is positioned to generate financial returns within our long term target range.", "In the agency channel we added 167,000 policies during 2015, an 8% increase from the end of 2014. As always there remains competition in auto and we remain committed to keeping our products priced accordingly through disciplined expense management and superior pricing and underwriting segmentation.", "As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the auto business to continue to grow in both policy accounts and premium volume although at a more moderated percentage than 2015 as the portfolio grows.", "As per agency auto profitability, we\u2019ve mentioned on several occasions that we\u2019re comfortable with where our margins are given the current market environment. That still remains the case today. The full year underlying agency combined ratio of just under 97% was in line with our expectations for the year and a result we are pleased with.", "This combined ratio is somewhat higher than our long term goal. We have been particular by the amount of new business that we've added over the past two years.", "Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long term target returns. But as you all know, the relatively higher combined ratio of new business improves over time. As we look into 2016, the significant volume of new business we've added will drive a slightly higher calendar year combined ratio, compared to 2015.", "So far the profitability of Quantum Auto 2.0 is maturing in line with our expectation. With this return profile, we continue to seek more new business as it should be accretive to long term return.", "In homeowner, the financial returns generated in the last couple of years have been exceptional and well within our target range. As you recall, we made significant improvement in the risk profile of this business over the last few years including changes in deductibles, other terms and conditions, and tightened underwriting guidelines.", "Of course, this is a more volatile business that will always have a weather dynamic to it. The weather in the last couple of years has been somewhat lower than our model suggested. But we know that won't always be the case.", "As we look ahead to 2016, we expect the profitability - we do expect underlying underwriting margins in agency homeowners and other to be lower than 2015 reflecting more normalized levels of loss activity.", "As Alan mentioned, we are also very pleased with the improvements we've seen in homeowners production. This is attributable in part to account rounding along with making some localized pricing and process adjustments. And certainly the turnaround benefited from the momentum and agent engagement from the roll-out of Quantum Auto 2.0.", "At this point, the business has leveled-off from a policies and force perspective and we expect modest growth in 2016.", "Now, I'll just highlight a couple of things specific to the quarter. Looking at agency auto, new business premium was up 32% and net premium was up 12% from fourth quarter 2014 level and we have added 51,000 policies during the quarter.", "The combined ratio for the quarter was 98.1 and included over two points of favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio was a 100.2, up from the prior year due predominantly to adverse weather in this year's quarter and the benefit in the prior year quarter of a 2.5 point favorable re-estimation of losses related to the first three quarters of 2014.", "As per loss trend in auto, our view of normalized frequency and severity remained consistent with recent quarters at around 3% in aggregate. There continues to be a lot of discussion about trend, particularly increase in frequency. From our advantage point, while we may observe normal fluctuations in any particular period due to things like weather, we see a stable and unchanged long term frequency trend.", "As always, we continue to monitor external information and our own data closely using our expenses analytic capability.", "Turning to agency homeowners and other for the quarter, we once again had strong financial results despite relatively active weather in the month of December. The underlying combined ratio of 59.5 was slightly higher than the exceptionally favorable prior year quarter.", "As for production, new business premiums were up 27% from the prior year quarter and continue to trend favorably, while retention remained strong at 85%. Policies in force were up slightly both sequentially from last quarter and from the fourth quarter of 2014.", "So to sum up personal insurance, we are exceptionally proud of the year we've had and look forward to more of the same in 2016.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabi.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Doreen. Tina, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call. If I can ask you all to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you very much. Tina, go ahead please.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you and good morning. The first question I had was on the potential for share buyback. Alan, any change in view in terms of deploying loan excess annual earnings and share buybacks - got buybacks is \u2013 just slightly annually over the past - thinking we might put that trend in place for 2016, 2017 as well.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, good morning. Thanks for the question. No change in strategy or approach to share buybacks or capital management overall and there is no intent to this, it's never been an effort to deploy more than earnings right. We had excess capital in past years and we made that very clear that we were sort of adding that to our annual income to buy back stock but, we said I don't know, a year or two ago that our level of buybacks would be tied to our level of income.", "And so we\u2019ll have a level of earnings, we\u2019ll do what we need to do with it whether that\u2019s making pension contributions or investments in the business and we\u2019ll take what\u2019s left in and return that to shareholders and there won\u2019t be a perfect correlation between earnings in a year and share buybacks in a year. There is some timing differences but I think as we said pretty consistently recently, share buybacks going forward will be tied to earnings.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay. And then on the investment income from the non-fixed income investments, it was clearly impacted by lower energy prices in 4Q and given the collapse in energy prices so far this year, I\u2019m just trying to get a base on what you might expect for 2016, is that $25 million results, taking ahead lower on a quarterly basis from what we saw in 4Q.", "Jay Benet", "Let me just clarify one thing, $25 million that relates to fixed income portfolio not the non-fixed income portfolio.", "Bill Heyman", "Jay, its Bill Heyman. Obviously this week is a hard week from which to extrapolate for the rest of the year. The marks as of year-end reflected a price which was an oil price higher than the price which obtained today but not by as much as one might think. During the year most funds wrote down their holdings and in some cases after the write-downs the price of petroleum rose but nothing was written up again.", "So we think a lot of these portfolios have been marked pretty hard. That said, if we had to predict either way, there is probably a little downside left in the portfolio but the portfolio isn\u2019t that big that the amount are to be material then the aggregate.", "Jay Benet", "Okay, that's helpful for a starting point. And Jay just to clarify, so as talking about the $25 million of income in 4Q from the non-fixed income investment portfolio in terms of the \u2013 fixed income, I understand what you were saying in terms of lower - ", "Jay Gelb", "I apologize for the confusion there.", "Jay Benet", "That's okay, no problem so, but Bill you\u2019re saying that $25 million after tax we saw in 4Q shouldn't be that impacted by lower energy prices even so far.", "Bill Heyman", "No, I couldn\u2019t put a number on this especially after the first part of this month but I\u2019m simply saying that everyone assumes that there is a lot of downside based on prices as they are today and there might be less downside than it appears simply because of the way in which funds mark their holdings in 2015. ", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Tina. Next question please?", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Randy Binner of FBR & Co. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner", "I think you touched on this in the opening commentary but from my perspective the pricing - the headline pricing number you provided in the slide-deck the plus 0.6% was better than expected and I guess I\u2019m interested in your perspective and if you think Travelers is unique here, a lot of the headlines surveys that we will get in the industry for commercial lines are moving significantly negative across the board.", "So I just want to get your perspective on it if you think Travelers is unique here and how kind of much discipline I guess you think - your competitors are holding against the software market?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Randy, good morning it\u2019s Alan. You said it was a surprise, it wasn't a so a surprise to us, it may've been a surprise to you or others but relatively to the surveys what we can tell you is, we\u2019re showing a real data and I think what we\u2019ve always seen is surveys tend to be anecdotally based and tend to maybe over emphasize some volatility either up or down because maybe the people respond to the surveys or thinking about the last transaction or the transactions in their mind.", "So there is really nothing about this that surprises us and you know we've been saying for a while that we expect the amplitude of the market to moderate. This appears to have moderated and I think you know the fact that we can achieve what we did is, I think a function of two things, one our data and analytics, our expertise, our ability to execute at a very, very granular level and a marketplace that is, we would describe as remarkably stable and at the moment rational.", "Randy Binner", "Just a quick follow up, are there any lines that are really helping that figure, meaning is workers\u2019 comp still kind of the best from a pricing perspective where some other casually lines might be moving negative?", "Brian MacLean", "No, this is Brian. It's still a pretty tight band to be honest with you across all the lines. So nothing is dramatically out of pattern up or down. As we commented and Alan touched on in his comments and I in mine, it\u2019s a more larger accounts feeling more pressure than medium and smaller accounts as we said national property is the space where we\u2019re seeing you know more significant rate declines than others. So I think it\u2019s more an account size than a line of business volatility or variability.", "Randy Binner", "That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nannizzi", "I guess Doreen maybe a little bit more on the auto side, have you seen any impact from the rise in miles driven in your auto book just given the fact that your growth is sort of come alongside that rise in miles driven?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "So let me just talk a little bit about miles driven. The data shows that probably year-to-date the miles driven are up about 2.5% per capita and there is still a lot of debate about whether that makes a difference if it's a long trip, a short trip, whether there is unemployment, whether you have safety features in your vehicles, and so you know we watch that closely but our long term trend of 3% anticipate that and we really haven't seen anything that that particular item is causing us to view frequency differently today.", "Brian MacLean", "And just to be crystal clear, the 3% is total trend where the frequency being a small fraction of it.", "Michael Nannizzi", "And then I guess in middle market, I mean with retention up in the high 80s, is that something that you could see that maybe coming down or would you be comfortable with that at a lower level if you saw an opportunity to find some more rate increase opportunities. Just seems like high 80s if pricing is flat and the result are pretty good, I mean is that an area where you could look to push for some more rate at some point?", "Brian MacLean", "This is Brian again. That is a constant balancing act in our organization every day. I will tell you that overall our core middle market business from a return perspective is in a very healthy spot and as I said in the comments when we look at our better performing business which is not a tiny part of the portfolio, our very well performing business, we are at retentions north of 90 with pretty modest price increases.", "We\u2019d obviously love to renew it in the 90s with different price increases but retaining that business is a real priority because it is returning very, very well.", "With that said, we\u2019re always looking for opportunities to see where we can balance the rate and retention trade off.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, I'd add to that that, even though that\u2019s not the headline number, that continues to be a headline number and the execution below that number is very, very granular. So we\u2019re not managing that headline number, we\u2019re managing every single account.", "Michael Nannizzi", "And just real quick. Alan or Bill, did you guys disclose - definitely appreciate your scores on the energy portfolio. Do you guys disclose anywhere you have the BBB minus category of energy exposure as well just that sort of next rating level up?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Well, I can say that the investment grade portfolio has an average rating of single A and the high-yield portfolio, which is 23 credits with book value of $162 million has an average rating of BB minus, which given the size or to give you what you need.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.", "Josh Stirling", "I was just thinking may you live an interesting times. You've had good fortune here to become CEO at the time the industry structure is changing very rapidly. I mean obviously over the past six months, we've seen ACE and Chubb merge. It creates a very large and powerful competitor. And on the other hand over at AIG there is presumably going to be lots of opportunities for everyone in the industry.", "As you thought from Travelers perspective, how the environment is evolving, how are you guys going to sort of tackle these new challenges and opportunities and what should we do to seek Travelers take advantage of all these change in the market?", "Alan Schnitzer", "So I guess what I would share with you is that we are very aware and deeply engaged in all of those things. So whether that's - what's going on with any of our competitors or what's going on with technology or big data or driverless cars, consolidation among distribution, you could go on and on. I think what I would share with you is we're very aware and deeply engaged.", "As we see all of those things and others, those by the way weren't meant to be necessarily in order what's top in my mind, just what came to my mind but as we think of everything that's got the potential to change in this marketplace, nothing is going to change overnight. These are things that are all going to evolve and develop overtime. And what we've got great confidence in is our positioning to manage all of them.", "So we think we can understand and manage. We've got the talent, we've got the resources, we've got a deep understanding of risk and reward. And the quality of our underlying business, the results you see this quarter and this year, we've got no distractions.", "So we are starting from a really good point as we think about and engage on all of those issues. And without taking one by one, for the most part and maybe all in, we see more opportunities than we do risk. But we're certainly examining them from both sides making sure that where there is opportunity, we're positioning ourselves to be able to leverage it and where there is risk that we're making sure we do everything we need to do to mitigate it.", "Josh Stirling", "I wonder if we could maybe just switch gears a little bit. You've mentioned risk. Could you give us a little bit of - either Alan or Brian or whoever is appropriate, a little bit of help of understanding what the liability side exposures maybe not Travelers per say, but generally for the industry from a meltdown and the commodities and energy patch would be.", "I mean presumably, we might see a bunch of bankruptcies, use a lot of different product lines that everybody in the industry sells under companies. And I remember a decade or so ago, Chubb really surprised people when they had got hurt and energy surety deal with Enron. And obviously both D&O and E&O exposures and maybe work comps severity.", "So I'm sure you guys are playing defense here. I'm wondering if you can help us sort of things through how you and your underwriters are thinking about potential exposures if they've had part of the role keeps getting hurt.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I'll start and I'll look at either Brian or Doreen, and invite them to jump in. I'll say you sort of hit it. We think about the loss side of that equation all the time and whether it's going to our measure and liability book or surety book making sure that we understand what our exposures are. And I'll say that we look at these things - we don't wait for there to be something significant in the marketplace to look at it, we're looking at it all the time and as far out as we can.", "So we're managing our nets, we're looking on the surety side what kind of collateral we have for instance on some of these accounts. We exit accounts when we need to exit accounts. But we've got a really good track record I think in all of those businesses.", "So just on manageable liability side, for example, we're much more heavily waited on the private non-profit side as opposed to the large public D&O. And so it's - this is what we do every day is manage risk and think about risk and reward.", "Doreen Spadorcia", "The only thing I'd add to that is that when we see any potential issue, we run that through our entire book of business not just what that class of business is. So we look at all the consequential effects that they may have on related industries.", "And so for example in writing bank we look at the level of their portfolios that are exposed not just to oil and gas, but any one thing in particular. So obviously, surety watching credit and looking at collateral, other management liability areas looking at concentration, but this is unique to us. We always take an issue and run it through the entire book and look at any consequences that might come from that.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Tunis", "I think my first question is for Brian. And I think he mentioned in his prepared remarks that in middle market I think the better accounts you were - renewing I think with the modest rate decline. The decline, but it's kind of like it was only modest.", "I guess I'm just curious how is the conversation changing with those better accounts, now versus maybe a year ago. Right now like I said, something maybe a modest decline, I mean is that kind of where - whatever one is kind of looking for is still just modest or - how's that conversation evolving?", "Brian MacLean", "It's pretty much as you're saying and as you would expect based on the data. A couple of years ago, almost every conversation was starting with some form of price increase even for the best accounts, because everybody saw where the trends were and that is gradually mitigated overtime.", "But even with those better accounts, the conversation start somewhere with trying to renew it at a modest decline or flat. Obviously, if the average is less than 2% there is still some that are positive.", "The thing that we're doing probably a little different than we were a year or two ago is we're really trying to get out as early as possible frequently at least three if not six months ahead of time, have conversations with the broker and the account. I think we do have a strong franchise with a valued product and valued services. And fortunately most of those company start by wanting to stay with us.", "And then I think the other key point is really being able to have the data and analytics where our frontline people can see and really segment their portfolio and in the middle market account by account. Look at how they're performing. And when there are issues either in that account, in that line or in that class of business being able to have an informed conversation with the broker about what those are and why we're trying to do what we're doing on the account really, really makes a difference.", "So I'd say the big change is getting out early and having a kind of granular conversation on the performance of that line and that business.", "Ryan Tunis", "My follow up was actually follow-up to Jay's question on capital return and excessive operating income. I guess since the start of 2014, we see like your premiums surplus ratio has drifted up from about 1% to 1.2%. Leverage has been relatively flat. You've said over the past couple of years you've had access. You've been able to deploy. How do we think about that level of access? Just because on those metrics it does seem like whatever access you did have, you have sort of used to at certain extend. Are those metrics even relevant?", "Jay Benet", "The premium to surplus ratio, I would view as not being relevant at all. I mean that was a ratio that was used at a time when rating agencies and regulators didn't have the sophisticated models they have today.", "So I've said on previous calls, we deal with each one of the models whether it's our internal models, regulatory models or the rating agency models to come to a place where given the profile of our business as it relates to each quarter what is the capital that we think we need in the operating entities that we manage to support AA rating and support a solid AA rating, not one with the wind blows we're worried about our ratings going down.", "So that's always the starting point. Given the size of our book, it doesn't change very much from quarter to quarter, but what does change is the profitability in each quarter. So there are some quarters where the profitability whether it's for favorable development or some other things to take place, it's higher than our expectations keeping in mind that we have a flow of monies out of the operating companies up to the holding company each quarter based on expectation.", "So to the extend we earn more. We bring some more up probably a little later than that. I think if you go back over time and you go pass two years ago to an earlier period and start adding up, the earning versus the share repurchase that you see that there is a very, very strong correlation to that. So I wouldn't read into anything that says one year we've done a little more than earnings, in other year we did less.", "It's really just as Alan said earlier the timing. The premium to surplus ratio goes up a little bit, I've kind of ignored that and what I would look at is in our supplement, we talk about specifically on a quarterly basis what the stat surplus is. And I think you can see that, that moves around probably in a pretty narrow band.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.", "Vinay Misquith", "Just a question on loss cost trend and the pricing roughly flat. Curious how you\u2019re managing to leave margins flat in '16 versus '15?", "Brian MacLean", "So this is Brian. And speaking for the BII segment, you start with the kind of simple arithmetic of the earned premium. And again it's not just rate, its price, which includes exposure change and does offset some of trends.", "So when we look at the arithmetic of earned rate versus loss trend, we come up with a very modest about a 0.5% of loss ratio compression into 2016. And that of course is based on our assumption of loss trend, which is as we've said running right now at about 4% and looking at a relatively stable orderly marketplace.", "And then that's offset by a variety of other factors you can think of whether large losses mix change underwriting actions, et cetera. But the real starting point is that compression from the rate loss trend dynamic, price loss trends dynamic is a pretty modest number in how we're looking at it.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And I think that distinction between price and rate is important, because as we said in the past there is a meaningful component of exposure that from a profitability perspective behaves like rate. And so what we really see in that true margin deterioration, is we see going forward as Brian said it's very small and probably within the margin of error of all the other things that impact margin.", "Vinay Misquith", "The second question is on the pace of future rate increases you mentioned that on a best counts you have, rate decreases of less than 2%. So curious to what proportion of the accounts now are well performing. So should we see sort for the pressure on pricing this year, because more of the accounts are better performing?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I think there is a level of granularity and precision here that's for competitive reasons. I'm not going to overly segment the portfolio. I think the backdrop to this is really the view of, do we think the industry is going to continue to fundamentally be focused on the returns on the products. And we think that's the right way to be thinking about the business and we're optimistic that the majority of the marketplace is actually looking at that.", "So the healthier the business, the more pressure there should be on pricing, but in the aggregate we're pretty comfortable that we should be able to generate appropriate with pricing to maintain reasonable returns. And then you can come up with any variation on the theme you want off of that and be as bullish or as bearish as you want.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Charles Sebaski", "I have couple of question I guess on the personal lines business. I guess the first on the personal auto growth and the success you had from Quantum. Is that coming from standalone auto policies? I guess I'm trying to just understand that you kind of sweet spot seems to be on package, multi policy programs. You have auto growth while homeowners' is flat. Just kind of, wondering how you're working in the auto growth relative to your, kind of, packaged program?", "Doreen Spadorcia", "Good morning, this is Doreen. We've actually seen success in force. I think this was some of what Alan and I referred to in our earlier comments. Clearly our auto product was competitive in agent's office and also in the direct channel. And in many cases, what that did, because we are an account focused company, that allowed us then to bring the home with it.", "So we've seen standalone auto come in, we've seen more opportunities for cross-selling. And I don't think it's anything small, given Quantum Auto 2.0 that we've been able to actually increase and stop the shrinkage in homeowners.", "We've also put some processes in place that have been very helpful where it prefills certain information so that if someone is looking at an auto quote, it will prefill for home. So we like the account business, we continue to look for that. But given where the returns are and where we're going with auto, we are pleased with that as well.", "Charles Sebaski", "Just a follow up to a comment that you guys made in the business insurance regarding the exposure drag and the oil and gas exposure, I think you said that oil and gas accounted for one point exposure drag but that oil and gas only accounted for 3% of the book, or is that 3% of the exposure? I guess I was trying to understand how 3% could account for a one point drag.", "Jay Benet", "The 3% is a premium number but the exposure, as you can imagine, was down pretty significantly. So when you've combined the 3% against a pretty big exposure delta in oil and gas, that drove the 1%.", "Gabriella Nawi", "And the 3% is the total domestic business insurance, not to middle market in that written premium.", "Jay Benet", "So that's a good point and maybe we shouldn't mix those two numbers. The 1% drag was on the middle market exposure change. The 3% was on total domestic BI. So we did that arithmetic quickly. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "The 3% is the premium, the book. The 1% is on the charge and the exposure. The 1% exposure drag is middle market exposure, the 3% is quantifying a percentage of the premiums of our oil and gas business on the total business insurance.", "Jay Benet", "Right. The premium on just middle market would be a higher number.", "Charles Sebaski", "The math just didn't seem to work, I appreciate the clarity.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. And this will be our last and final question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "First question is on reserve releases. Looks like workers comp have releases in 2014 accident year, just curious while it is already release rather than for this - normally a long tail line of basis, can you talk also in general, what's loss cost trend by major lines and how that compare with your 4% assumption in overall loss cost trends?", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. Just in terms of the reserve release, when you're dealing with a long tail line, you've two components to how you're going to look to results. One is, what has developed in terms of loss activity, and you're absolutely right. In a short period of time, you're not going to really see a great deal of activity.", "On the other hand, what you've done is, you established the starting point for what you think the loss activity is going to be and we refer to that as the loss pick. So just imagine on January 1, trying to predict what the losses are going to be for the entire period of time as those workers comp policies will be out there.", "And we come up with a loss pick, and the example I'm going to use, I'm just making up a number, let's say it's 60%, based on what you've seen historically. And looking at the historical data then for earlier accident years and evaluating that against that initial loss pick that you had for a current year and there were times when you see loss activity in prior years that you say, that really has no barring whatsoever on how I thought about the starting point for the current year and then there are times, when you look at it and say, no actually this really does change the bar for the starting point.", "So usually on a long tail line of business when you see us do what we\u2019ve done here, it's based on what we refer to is base here moment. Looking at the history and just saying that, the initial loss pick was a little on the high side.", "A \u2013 Brian MacLean", "This is Brian. Just to respond to your - trend by line in business is actually a pretty tight band with ranging from the high 3s to the high 4s but an average trend of right around 4%. So nothing is really out of pattern by line.", "Kai Pan", "My follow up question is for Alan. Now you have 7 weeks on the new role, so I just wonder what\u2019s your top priority these days and what you think - you have the right strategy in place now, but what are you focusing on?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure. Thanks for the question Kai. So I had experienced managing essentially all of our commercial business and our businesses outside the U.S. what I haven't had experienced with is, the personalized business on a relative basis not as much, personalized business in some of our functions like claim and IT and ops and things like that, risk control, so, I\u2019m trying to spend a lot of time in those businesses and areas that I haven't had the experience with, trying to spend a lot of time on the road out in the field with distribution and our employees in the field which has always been a priority of mine.", "And I guess beyond that in my comments I said one of the things that we\u2019re going to do is continue to evolve and innovate and reassessing is something that we\u2019ve always done and Jay Fishman has always led that initiative.", "And so I have taken that over from Jay and just like Jay didn\u2019t do it alone, Jay did it with the group, I\u2019ll continue to leave the group in making sure that we\u2019re accessing what\u2019s going on in the marketplace and we\u2019re evolving and innovating.", "So I would say that makes up so the way I'm allocating my turn.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you very much for all the answers.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. As always, the Investors Relation team is available for any follow up questions you might have.

Welcome to the First Quarter Results Teleconference for Travelers. We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session.", "As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on April 21, 2016.", "At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may now begin.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2016 first quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be: Alan Schnitzer, CEO; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer; and Doreen Spadorcia, Vice Chairman, Chief Executive Officer of Claim, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions. In addition, Jay Fishman and other members of senior management team are in the room.", "Before I turn it over to Alan, I'd like to draw your attention to the explanatory note included at the end of the webcast. Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from these projected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to any update forward-looking statements.", "Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our website.", "And now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.", "This morning, we reported first quarter operating income of $698 million, or $2.33 per share, and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Especially in light of a relatively high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, our underwriting results across the board remain strong, as reflected in our combined ratio of 92.3%.", "To put the weather in some context, our catastrophe losses were about $100 million, after tax, higher in the quarter than they were last year, and these are the highest first quarter cat losses we've had since 2010. The timing of catastrophes is, of course, unpredictable, but this level of weather volatility is certainly within our playbook. We're confident in our ability to model and manage our exposures and that we're pricing appropriately for the risk. In this case, it just so happens that, by design, we have a healthy market share in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, where severe hailstorms were concentrated. Doreen will have more to say about the severity and about our claim analytics.", "The real story this quarter is about our execution in the marketplace. And across all our businesses, we couldn't be more pleased. In our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in our efforts to maximize retentions on our best-performing accounts and improved profitability on poor-performing business. Retentions in the quarter were again at very high levels by historical standards and renewal premium change was positive.", "We believe these production results were right on target, given our view of product returns, but as we've explained before, we don't manage the business on an aggregate basis. We execute deliberately, account-by-account or class-by-class. And you can see this on Slide 13 of the webcast, which displays the distribution of rate changes for our Middle Market accounts in the first quarter. As you can see from the slide, most accounts received a single-digit rate increase and there were a number of accounts that had a rate increase of greater than 5% or even 10%. So even now with the headline pure rate change just slightly negative, we continue to achieve rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing business.", "The real takeaway from this slide is that the aggregate rate number is simply an average of thousands of individual account actions, and that success in this business is not about the aggregate rate number. It's about taking the right action on each account and generating an appropriate return over time.", "Our execution in the quarter also benefited from a commercial lines pricing environment that, from our vantage point, continues to be remarkably stable. The outlook that we provided this morning in our 10-Q for our BII and BSI segments suggest more of the same: continued high levels of retention and broadly consistent underlying underwriting margins.", "In terms of execution, we were just as successful in our Personal Insurance business, with strong retentions and higher PIF counts in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners. Importantly, Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our expectations on all fronts.", "The successful execution across all our businesses resulted in consolidated net written premiums that were about 5% higher in the quarter than they were in the prior year. Both new business levels and historically high levels of retention, particularly in our Middle Market business, contributed significantly to the top-line growth. The quality and breadth of our products and services, our extraordinary talent in the field and the strength of the relationships that we have with our agent and broker partners put us in a great position to win. In addition to that, we believe that we benefited in the quarter, both in terms of new and renewal business, from the stability and consistency we provide in the marketplace compared to some of our competitors, who are experiencing varying degrees of disruption.", "Turning to capital management, as a reflection of the confidence that we have in our business, today, our Board of Directors declared an approximately 10% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.67 per share, the 12th consecutive year of dividend increases, and bringing the compound annual growth rate of the dividend to almost 10% over that time. All-in-all, despite an active quarter from a catastrophe perspective, a great start to the year.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Alan. I'll start by saying that we were pleased with our first quarter results, operating income of $698 million and operating return on equity of 12.5%, despite their being lower than the prior year quarter.", "As page 4 of the webcast indicates, the $129 million decrease in operating income from last year's first quarter did not come about due to lower underlying underwriting results. Our consolidated underlying combined ratio is 90% this quarter, 30 basis points better than the prior year quarter. Rather, the decrease in operating income, along with the decrease in operating ROE, resulted from two items: cat losses that were $101 million higher on an after-tax basis than those in the first quarter of 2015; and, as we anticipated in the Outlook section of our 2015 10-K, a $24 million after-tax reduction in fixed income net investment income that was driven by the continuing low interest rate environment.", "Page 4 also provides an analysis as to how our reported results compared to analyst estimates. As best we can tell, analyst estimates for cat losses were significantly lower than what actually occurred, which more than accounts for the difference. Our net investment income was $439 million, after tax, this quarter, which was $39 million lower than the prior year quarter. In addition to the lower fixed income returns, non-fixed income NII was down $15 million after-tax, due to lower hedge fund returns that resulted from the more challenging capital market conditions in recent months.", "Each of our business segments once again contributed to net favorable prior year reserve development which totaled $180 million on a pre-tax basis. In Business and International Insurance, net favorable development of $93 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Workers' Comp excess coverages for accident years 2006 and prior; and General Liability, primarily for excess coverages for accident years 2011 and 2013; in Commercial Auto for accident years 2010 and prior; and in our European and Canadian operations.", "In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $60 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Surety for accident years 2012 through 2014. And in Personal Insurance, net favorable development of $27 million resulted from better than expected loss experience in Homeowners and Other for liability coverages for accident year 2014, and in Auto for accident year 2014.", "On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years developed favorably, other than the 2015 accident year, which is currently showing $65 million of unfavorable development, due to a few large property losses that occurred late in 2015 and a decision we made to rebalance personal insurance reserves among various accident years. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines either developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development this quarter. While CMP developed unfavorably by $35 million, there was offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.", "Operating cash flows of $850 million remain very strong, and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of over $1.7 billion. All of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $2.7 billion pre-tax, or $1.8 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $82.65 and adjusted book value per share of $76.63 increased 4% and 2%, respectively, from the beginning of the year.", "We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses, allowing us to return $790 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $181 million and repurchased $609 million of our common shares this quarter, including $550 million under our publicly-announced share repurchase program, consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, and $59 million to partially offset shares issued under employee incentive plans, mostly to cover employee withholding taxes due upon the vesting and payout of performance and restricted stock awards. And as Alan said, the board raised our quarterly dividend from $0.61 to $0.67 per share.", "So with that, let me turn the mic over to Brian.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks, Jay. In Business and International Insurance, operating income was $476 million, with a combined ratio of 94.8%. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.3%, up about 0.5 point compared to the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a typical level of quarterly fluctuations within both the loss and expense ratios. This result is in line with our expectations, and we continue to feel very good about our underlying results.", "Net written premiums for the quarter were up 3% year-over-year, with Domestic Business Insurance premiums up about 5%, driven by the strong production results across all our businesses.", "In Domestic Business Insurance, we remain pleased with the continued execution of our pricing strategy. Given the attractive returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention and, accordingly, we're very pleased that retention is at a historical high of 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change came in at 2.2 points, while renewal rate change was down slightly in the quarter and about flat overall. New business increased to $575 million, reflecting strong results across all our businesses.", "Turning to the individual businesses, beginning with Select, we achieved strong retention of 81%, and renewal premium change of nearly 7%. Rate change was down about a point versus the fourth quarter of 2015, driven in large part by recently filed rate changes in Workers' Compensation. We generated new business of $103 million, up slightly year-over-year.", "In Middle Market, retention reached a historic high of 88%, with renewal premium change of a point, in line with the fourth quarter of 2015. Importantly, retention of our best-performing business was approximately 90%, while for our poorer-performing accounts, we achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend. New business of $321 million was up 8% year-over-year, due in large part to strong results in our Construction business.", "In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up both year-over-year and compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. Renewal premium change of about a point was in line with recent quarters, while new business of $151 million was up 24% versus the prior year, driven by Inland Marine, Boiler and Transportation lines of business. So across Domestic Business Insurance, we achieved strong retention and saw an increased level of new business opportunities in the marketplace. As Alan mentioned, our agents and brokers view us as a stable market with industry-leading products and services, which we believe had a favorable impact on both retention and new business, particularly in this environment, where several significant competitors are experiencing some degree of disruption.", "Turning to International, net written premiums for the first quarter were down about 10% year-over-year, primarily due to the adverse impact of foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 4%, driven by disciplined underwriting in the face of highly competitive market conditions in the property lines at Lloyds. Retention for the quarter was strong at 82%. Renewal premium change was slightly negative, but above recent quarters, and new business of $76 million was up more than 30% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic personal lines auto product in Canada. This product was modeled after our U.S.-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product. And while we're still in the early days of the rollout, we're encouraged by the response, as we continue to see a significant increase in new business volume.", "In summary, in the segment, we achieved strong underlying underwriting and production results, a great start to 2016.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Doreen.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Thank you, Brian, and good morning, everyone. Bond & Specialty Insurance started 2016 with a strong first quarter. And we remain exceptionally pleased with the financial returns in this segment. For the quarter, operating income was $144 million, up from the first quarter of 2015, due primarily to a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. We've also improved underlying underwriting results.", "The underlying combined ratio of 81.1% was almost two points better than the prior year, driven by two items: one, the favorable expense impact of certain customer-related intangible assets, which became fully amortized during second quarter of 2015; and second, lower loss levels in certain management liability businesses.", "Underlying returns in this segment were once again very strong and remain well within our target level. Results like this do not happen by accident. Insights provided by our deep industry expertise and analytics, along with disciplined execution of long-term strategies, has positioned us to successfully navigate arising economic challenges, the most recent being the disruption in the coal and broader energy sectors.", "As for top line, we generated higher net written premiums for the quarter as compared to 2015 in both our Management Liability and Surety businesses. The increased Surety production reflected higher contract bond activity from mid-sized construction accounts. Across our Management Liability businesses, retention remains strong at 87%. New business premium was up more than 20% from the first quarter of 2015, and renewal premium change was up from recent quarters, driven by the non-rate components of RPC, including slight increases in average policy duration and insured exposures.", "These results reflect the execution of our strategy to retain our best accounts and write more business in our return adequate product segments. In sum, strong top and bottom line results for Bond & Specialty and we continue to feel great about this segment's performance.", "I'll now turn to Personal Insurance. Operating income for the quarter was $139 million, down $113 million from the prior year quarter due to $69 million in higher tax and $68 million in lower net favorable prior year reserve development. The segment's underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 86.1%, 1.4 points better than the 2015 quarter. This improvement was driven by a lower expense ratio, which was due, in large part, to higher premium volume.", "We continue to be pleased with production results and underlying financial returns in both Agency Auto and Agency Homeowners & Other. Looking at Agency Auto, we once again generated strong top line results and the loss experience of Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to perform in line with expectations. The combined ratio of 95.2% for the quarter was five points higher than the prior year quarter, due primarily to higher tax and a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development.", "The underlying combined ratio of 94% was up 1 point from last year, in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we've discussed before, the significant levels of new business we've added in the last couple of years will result in a higher calendar year loss ratio in the early years, and improve over time. Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced to our long-term target return and is maturing in line with our expectation. As for our overall view of loss trend, blended frequency of severity remains unchanged at around 3%.", "Production results continue to be exceptional at Agency Auto, with net written premiums up 13% year-over-year, driven by higher new business premiums and strong retention. We continue to grow policies in force, which increased 55,000 during the quarter.", "Turning to Agency Homeowners & Other, we generated a combined ratio of 90.4%, even including catastrophes of 16 points. While cats were higher this quarter, the underlying combined ratio of 76.2% improved more than three points from the prior year quarter, driven by favorable non-cat weather. As you all know, weather will be volatile from period-to-period.", "As Alan mentioned, this quarter was particularly impacted by severe hailstorms in the Greater Dallas/Fort Worth area. Slide 21 of the webcast is an extract from our Hail Dashboard, which many of you will recognize from our Investor Day. This view is CAT 21, the most substantial event in the quarter, and shows you how much of the area was impacted by two and even three-inch hail. This demonstrates our proprietary capability to get near real-time data about hail size and duration, as well as potentially impacted policies.", "Using this information facilitates a more effective claim response and assists us in estimating losses. Using these tools, as well as our on-site work in the area, we identified this as a significant event early on and were somewhat surprised at how low the industry estimates were. As more information has become public, it would appear that industry estimates for this event will rise. Notwithstanding the weather volatility, we remain very pleased with the underlying financial returns we're generating in this business, as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies.", "As for production in Agency Homeowners & Other, we continue to make good progress, in line with our expectations. New business premium was up more than 30% from the prior year quarter. Retention remains strong at 85%. And we added 26,000 policies during the quarter, so even with the significant cats during the quarter, a great start to the year for Personal Insurance.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thank you. We're now ready to take Q&A, if I could ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Operator, go ahead.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. And our first question is from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you and good morning. My first question on catastrophe in the quarter, the $380 million, almost a third of your sort of normalized annual budget of $1 billion, so does this surprise you? And there were talk about heightened activity in hailstorms. Does it have implication for your pricing as well as your market exposure?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Kai, good morning. It's Alan. Let me start and I'll see if others want to fill in. As I said in my opening remarks, the timing of catastrophes are always surprising to us, but there's nothing about the level of losses in that storm that are particularly surprising. It's in our playbook and we do feel like our risk selection and pricing is spot on, so nothing about this event that causes us to rethink anything. And if it had been a couple of weeks later in the second quarter, where we typically expect more frequency of severe storms, we wouldn't really have thought anything about it, so timing off by maybe a couple of weeks but nothing about it that we find surprising.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. My follow-up question is on the BI pricing, looks like continue the downward trends. I just wonder what give you confidence to maintain the good level of core margin or underlying margin, given the downward pricing trend, as well as now you have a higher level of new business. How do you make sure the underwriting of this or will that increase your initial accident year loss pick?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Kai, if you look at the gradual slope of that pricing trend, yes, pricing is going down, but it's very, very gradual and it's consistent with our product returns. And this is why we wanted to put in Slide 13 that really shows you the redistribution. We continue to look at the execution on a granular basis, and we're very comfortable with the way that we're pricing relative to the returns that we expect, that we're getting on these products.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah and, Kai, this is Brian MacLean. I'd just chime in on the new business front. First of all, I'd emphasize that we haven't changed any of our return thresholds or our target pricing. And if we're obsessing about one thing in the business today, it's the quality of the new business that we're taking in, and we remain very comfortable that it's in customer segments, products and industries that we really think we understand. So we feel very good about it.", "Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Well, thank you so much.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis from Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, great. Thanks. My first question, I think, is for Doreen. Just looking at margins, I guess, in Agency Auto, looked like the accident year loss ratio deteriorated by a little more than 1.5 points. And it sounded like you're still attributing that mostly to just the impact of new business. I'm just wondering if that's the type of margin drag we should expect for the remainder of the year from the pressure from new business, or if there's anything else, at least in the short-term, that maybe drove up that accident year loss ratio?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Let me talk about that for a minute. It is really attributable, and I would say solely; obviously, there's always a few things bouncing around, but driven by the volume of new business. What we build in to our modeling curves is the maturity of the book of business. And so what you'll see over time is, each cohort will begin to produce what our long-term returns are. So it is due to the level of new business.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Okay, understood. And then, I guess my follow-up then would just be for Jay Benet, on the investment income side. And it seems like a lot of the discussion's around lower investment yields, but something that stood out to us a little bit is that it looks like the average invested assets were down about a little more than 1% on the quarter. And it also looked like there was, in the 10-Q, an allusion to a $0.5 billion payment on the asbestos side that's coming in the second quarter.", "So just trying to understand, when you think about that $25 million to $30 million quarterly drag, is that contemplating sort of a lower level of invested assets, or should we think about that as all just being driven by your view of lower reinvestment rates? Thanks.", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, hi. This is Jay Benet. It is a combination of our view as to what the rate environment looks like, as well as what the average invested assets are and will be. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of last year, we had a large payment to finalize the direct actions settlement for asbestos. That brought the average down a little bit. And, as you rightly point out, we're expecting to make a final payment on the PPG settlement when other parties finalize some of the remaining issues, which we don't view as significant issues, in the second quarter. We expect to make that payment in the second quarter, so that will have an impact as well.", "Something else that affects the average invested assets, some of our assets are denominated in foreign currency. So you do have some currency exchange taking place where, in effect, the assets are still the same, just the currency-adjusted value is a little lower. But those are the two primary things, the two asbestos payments, that bring it down.", "Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)", "Hey, thanks so much.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed.", "Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Good morning. Thank you. First question is on that new business growth in Business Insurance, hoping to just get a little bit more color on, if that's coming from sort of disruption? It seems like the growth relative to the pricing trend, or what is talked about in the industry, is a little bit upside down. I mean, it's a little surprising, the size of it, so I would appreciate any help you could give on what's, you think, is really causing that expansion.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. It's Alan and, again, I'll start. We don't think there's anything different in the pricing, and there's certainly nothing different in the return thresholds that we're seeking that's driving that. At \u2013 both increased levels of retention and new business are contributing to it. I think that's an important point. And we really start with what I said in my opening remarks. We think it's the quality and breadth of our products and services, the talent we have in the field, the relationships we have with our producers. All of that always puts us in a great position to win.", "And on top of that this quarter, as both Brian and I noted, there was some disruption in the marketplace. And given our stability out there, we do think we benefit from that. It's hard, probably impossible, for any of us to try to put a finer point on the allocation of dollars to one cause or another, but we do think all of those things coming together resulted in the higher new business levels.", "Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "All right. And then, I guess for Doreen, I saw earlier in the quarter, you guys had a press release out that you're offering a discount for connected homeowners policies. I'm just curious. Any update on kind of that, or any of the other initiatives using technology into personal lines, be it pricing, be it UBI, et cetera?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah, we're still a little new in the space. I'll tell you a couple of things that we have. You know we have IntelliDrive, where we do offer a discount. It's mileage based. We're actually looking further into that, based on the apps (31:19) that are available and perhaps moving beyond mileage. So that's obviously on the list. Second, we did roll out, in a couple of pilot states, for use for individuals when they're using their car for Uber. And what it really does is, it covers what's called the trolling period. Until there's a match, then the coverage is clear that there isn't any personal insurance coverage.", "And then, this discount for connected homes and if you think about it, similar to what we would do for someone who has an alarm or something of that sort, but we do have both of our homes up at Claim U are connected homes. So we can study how the data comes in. We can study what that changes about the underwriting process and the claim process. And we're also a member of CNET, which has a very sophisticated connected home in Kentucky. And we're the only insurer on that CNET home board looking for all the applications in the connected space, so that's just a little of what we've got going on.", "Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States)", "Appreciate all the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Vinay Misquith from Sterne Agee. Please proceed.", "Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT", "Hi. Good morning. So the first question for Doreen, just wanted to follow up on the personal auto side. I believe you said frequency was up 3% this quarter for personal auto. Curious as to what it was last year, and have you seen any negative impact from the warmer weather so far in the northeast in the first quarter on your frequency?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "I'm going to give you really detailed answer, but the first thing I want do is correct that we've seen frequency of 3%. We've seen a normalized trend of 3%, which includes 0.5 point for frequency and 2.5 for severity. And that's been something that we've basically had baked into our results for two to three years at this point. So let me just go back a little bit on frequency, because I know we've talked a lot about it. We talked a lot about it at AFA, (34:03) too.", "We know that others have commented on frequency in the industry. Some have commented that they're seeing higher frequency. Some have not commented at all. So we don't feel like it's the thing that's just ripping through the industry. It's affecting very specific companies. And the most important thing for us is where you're starting from. What assumptions have you made? So we have not assumed flat frequency for a number of years. It's been a 0.5 point.", "And we may have talked about this last quarter, so I apologize if it's repetitive, but in 2014, there were some observations that frequency was dropping. We analyzed that very, very carefully and really didn't think it was systemic or sustainable. And so at that point, while we recognized the financial impact of that lower frequency for 2014, we went into 2015 assuming that trend was going to go back to where it was, and it did. And so the 0.5 point remains unchanged. The trend remains unchanged, and it really goes back to where you start from.", "Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT", "Okay. That's helpful. The second question is just a follow-up on the new business growth on the Business Insurance. And it seems that the growth was faster in Middle Market and Other Business Insurance, where pricing is maybe slightly weaker than the Select accounts. So was that just a coincidence or just curious as to what's happening between those segments. Thank you.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, so this is Brian. I think in Middle Market, in particular, we've been doing a lot of things with our process and our people to be really active in the marketplace. Our flow in new business opportunities there are up a bit. And so I think part of it is the activity we've had. I think it's also linked to, and, again, as Alan said, you can't draw perfect connections here, but there is disruption in the marketplace amongst some significant competitors. And I think our strong position with agents and brokers and the breadth of product that we have in capabilities have really helped us there. So I think we're very comfortable. As I also said, we're obsessing over the quality, so we're looking at all of those deals.", "In the Other Business Insurance world, there is some specific opportunities. We've got a transportation company, Northland Insurance, that does the smaller end of the trucking business, so not the large fleets primarily. They've had some neat opportunities. There's been some opportunity in the Inland Marine and Boiler business, again, somewhat a result of some actions that other carriers have taken. So I think all of those things have added up to it. And I think, I guess the main point, it's not tied directly to pricing and price change opportunity.", "Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Jay Gelb from Barclays. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. On the Business Insurance rate increase now turning negative, in the 10-Q, I saw in your outlook that for Business Insurance, the expectation is still a stable underlying combined ratio. Can you help me square those two factors?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Jay. It's Alan. When we talk about underlying underwriting margin in the outlook, what we're really talking about are dollars, not the combined ratio. And you could look at that as opposite sides of a coin, but we, for instance, would consider volume in there as well. But we've got the outlook being broadly consistent, and obviously we think about that as a margin of something around the prior year period.", "But in that outlook, earned margin is a little bit negative, and we've got an expectation for large losses improving and volume also improving, and those two things adding give us an outlook of broadly consistent.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I see. All right. And then my follow-up question is clearly you had elevated first quarter catastrophe losses; given all the destruction in Houston from the floods, if you can give us your perspective on that. Now, I know flooding isn't typically covered for things like homeowners, but it would impact comprehensive auto or maybe some commercial property insurance, if you could help us out there.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Jay, we're not going to pre-announce second quarter results. I would say we're early in the quarter and we typically expect the typical spring storms in the second quarter. So again, from a human perspective, human side of the news is terrible, but there's nothing about this that strikes us as particularly unusual. There are bad second quarter storms.", "Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Understood. Thanks.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you. Doreen, just to follow-up then on Ryan's question on personal auto, so is it then fair then if it's a function of sort of new business versus the older book that's impacting the loss ratio, so is it fair to assume that as long as the Quantum book continues to grow that that drags sort of continue to run through calendar year results?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Michael, I'm not sure I heard the question, but was it that as long as we're writing Quantum Auto 2.0, we see a drag?", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Well, I think the answer to Ryan's question was something like it's not the new business discount so much a part of it, but it's also because the Quantum book is growing faster than the older book, so there's some mix as well. And so I'm just trying to understand like we had about 180 basis points of drag in the first quarter. Is it fair to assume that as long as Quantum continues to outpace your legacy book in growth, that that drag will continue to roll forward?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Well, Michael, in the outlook, what we said is that our combined ratio would slightly deteriorate. And so I think that's fair for 2016. So we did expect that that pressure would come, and a lot of it has to do with the volume of the business.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yes. This is Brian. And I'm trying to get at what I think you're getting at. I'd make the point, the Quantum 2.0 profitability targets and margins are not different from our core book of business.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Right.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "It's the normal vintaging and aging of business. So if we continue to write significant levels of new business, that will have a comparable impact.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "And...", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Sorry, Mike, just to draw your attention it to; this is Gabby. Again, in the outlook, we do say the underlying underwriting margin and just to make fulsome, you've asked about the loss ratio, but, in fact, as we had talked about the Quantum product, it's the loss ratio and the expense ratio, given everything we had taken out. So if you look at the success of the product and what we're thinking about in terms of profitability, it all hangs together.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah. And look at the...", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "And to your point, the combined.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah. Great. And then just on the homeowners' side, just quickly, I saw the expense ratio tick down. It looks like that's sort of seasonally first quarter. But on the loss ratio side, is there anything that we should be thinking about in the underlying there or it looks like obviously you had cat activity, but was the non-cat weather element just lower in the quarter?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah. For the first quarter, it was favorable non-cat weather.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Got it. And then last quickly, the tax...", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "That made it favorable.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "The tax rate in the quarter, maybe this is for Jay.", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, I think you're asking the question why is the effective tax rate lower this quarter than it had been in prior year quarter. And the effective tax rate is always going to be driven by the mix of tax exempt income and fully taxable income. So what you're seeing here is the taxable income, fully taxable income, as a proportion of the total getting a little less because of the cat activity primarily. The change in the non-fully taxable income, the tax exempt income, was pretty de minimis. So if you do the math on that, you'll see that's the effect on the effective tax rate.", "Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Perfect. Thank you so much.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good morning. Thanks for the call. Congratulations on the quarter. Is there a similar new business effect on the commercial lines side where the seasoning causes an increase in the accident year? And if we see a continued acceleration of new business in the commercial lines side, would we see a similar pattern that we're seeing on the personal lines side?", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. In short, yes. There's a new business vintaging kind of concept, where if you've got disproportionately more new business, that would affect your performance on the current year stuff.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And, Paul, it's Alan. That's one of the reasons we point out that when we look at the higher levels of premium, it's pretty much evenly distributed between retention and new business. So it's not all coming from...", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "New business at higher loss ratios.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Understood. Is it more or less pronounced, in your opinion, than we see in the personal lines business?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're looking at each other. It's hard to say. It's probably similar, maybe a little less.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Okay. And then separately, I'd love to know a little bit more, from a product perspective, where we're seeing the disruptions from the competitive perspective?", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I mentioned some of them. In the construction space, there has been action by other underwriters in the larger account size on the casualty side. There's been some action in the loss responsive businesses. But I think it's also broadly across middle market, and this is where, as Alan said, you can't triangulate to precisely what the numbers are. I think that we have a very strong position with distribution. We've got quality products, and we're viewed as a very stable market. So I think the broad market conditions, even beyond specific products, have been helpful, maybe uniquely to us there. (46:15)", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Paul, we definitely saw it in those lines of business where we know some of our competitors were taking some actions, but we also saw retention just up generally across middle market. And so, when we look at the flow we're seeing and the businesses that we're seeing it in, it's pretty broadly based.", "Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP", "Good sign. Thank you very much.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Sarah DeWitt from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Following up on the Business Insurance underlying margin, is it fair to say that it's stable this year mostly because there was higher non-cat weather in 2015, but then, as you look out going forward, it would probably deteriorate because prices are below loss cost inflation? Is that a fair assumption, or am I off?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, Sarah, it wasn't so much weather in Business Insurance as it was a higher volume of large losses in the last three quarters of last year.", "Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And one of the reasons that we give outlook for three or four quarters is because it's just, our perspective beyond that gets unreliable, so I don't know. But what I would point you to is the way we've been able to manage returns across all three business segments over a long period of time throughout a bunch of different conditions. And so, you look at what Doreen and Greg and Michael have done in Personal Insurance by taking some difficult actions and repositioning that business and rolling out a new product; you look at what Tom Kunkel did in Bond & Specialty in a bunch of credit-sensitive businesses through a very difficult period in a financial crisis; think about what we've done in Business Insurance going back to 2010, when you look at the \u2013 we went back then, we looked at the outlook for returns and realized that we had to do some things differently.", "So your perspective that it might fall off beyond where we're giving guidance for suggests purely current course and speed. And I would say that we're current course and speed now because we like product returns, and when we get to a point in time where we don't like product returns, then we'll do different things. So I wouldn't necessarily draw the conclusion you were drawing. But I don't know for sure.", "Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're all speculating beyond three or four quarters.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "One of the other things that makes it very challenging is, we do talk about loss trend, and the loss trend is off of a starting point, and sometimes we adjust the starting point. You've heard us talk about base year movement. That comes about when we see favorable development and try to evaluate, well, what does that mean for the very loss picks that we had, that were the starting point for the loss trends that go forward. So it is, as Alan said, a pretty complicated set of variables that go into it, and the ability to look out much beyond three quarters or four quarters is a bit challenging.", "Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you. And then just on, in Auto Insurance, the top line growth there was very strong. Could you just elaborate on what was driving that? And is that a level that we should view as sustainable?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Well, what we've talked about, Sarah, is that the percentages probably won't be the same, because our base is growing. And, as you probably recall, Quantum 2.0 rolled out over a couple of years, and even including three more states this year, California, North Carolina and Massachusetts. And so, we think that the percentage will moderate, but we're not anticipating that the product would be less competitive.", "We also are pleased to see, and so were our agents, that they're actually getting a disproportionate share of their new business from captives in the direct marketplace, which is something that we talked to them about.", "So, I would say the percentage, we definitely don't think will stay the same, but probably from a count perspective, we expect it to continue to perform at similar levels.", "Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you for the answers.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Uh huh.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.", "Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah, thanks. A couple of just quick questions here, first, Doreen, I think you spoke at AFA (50:54) a little bit about increasing limits on homeowners. I'm just curious, kind of initial success you're having with that. How are agents responding?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Brian, let me just make sure that I reset, because what we talked about at AFA (51:14) was we had pilots underway with 10 agents in a couple of states and we took all of those suggestions: some, few coverage; a lot of process changes; and some guidance on pricing. And all of that work is getting done now.", "Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "So we're anticipating later in the year, beginning of 2017, that that would be broadly available. So all the work's being done, but it's not yet broadly in the marketplace.", "Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Is that going to require an increase in just your overhead expense, i.e. different types of claims adjusters as you get into that higher limit stuff; different types of underwriting, product, that kind of stuff?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "No, Brian. What we did as part of this assessment was looked at whether our current infrastructure, our current claim handling and our current product, could support that. We'll need to make a few tweaks to that, but we're not building this super high-end home capability. This is really the mass affluent and we think we have a really good match with our current capabilities in that marketplace.", "Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And just a quick one for Jay; Jay, it looks like your pension expense down, earned benefits (52:39) down about $17 million on a year-over-year basis. Is that something we should expect kind of going forward? And where does that hit in your P&L?", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "Okay. Well, in terms of the P&L, it's in a couple of places because pension expense, of course, relates to head count. And head count ends up in G&A as well as ULAE. So it's in more than one spot. But as it relates to, you know, what's taking place in the pension area, you may recall in the 10-K, we provided a disclosure saying that we were adopting a new methodology that went into the estimation of pension, and that dealt with using a yield curve approach rather than a spot rate for looking at the interest and service costs to coincide with how the PBO was being calculated. And that did have a benefit, and that'll be a benefit that carries on into the future.", "Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. I think this is for Doreen. When you have a quarter like this where catastrophes are a little bit higher, does that actually affect the G&A expense? I'm asking specifically homeowners, because that was down sequentially.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah, I didn't hear it.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it was about G&A expense?", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah. No, not...", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "No. Yeah, I think the answer is no, it doesn't really. There's obviously some claim expense that could be impacted, but...", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Right.", "Jay S. Benet - Vice Chairman & Chief Financial Officer", "But in that case, nothing unusual this past quarter.", "Doreen Spadorcia - Vice Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, Personal Insurance and Bond & Specialty Insurance", "Yeah. And the only thing down the road I would say about G&A is if we have a very, very profitable year in home, that's where we would add contingent commission, and so we'd be really happy if that went up because it was a great year.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay. Yeah, that makes sense. And then more broadly speaking, I think you've mentioned the disruption in the marketplace a few times. Is there enough disruption out there to make it worthwhile to look at sort of building out the skill set into more specialty lines?", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, there's nothing about the current level of disruption that's causing us to look at that, in the sense that we look at that all the time. We're always looking for opportunities to expand our product set and to drive our competitive advantages and capabilities into new lines of business, new products. So we certainly don't wait for a moment in time to do that.", "Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks very much.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Great. And this will be our last question, please.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from the line of Jay Cohen from Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. I guess question on the retention in Business Insurance; is it fair to say that this retention would have been at the upper end of what you might have expected given market conditions?", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah, Jay, this is Brian. Yeah. I mean, the 88% retention in Middle Market was very, very strong, and clearly would be at the upper end. We dissect where we're getting the retention. We feel great that it's about 90% in our best business. But it's our experience in the business would be that those are very tough levels to sustain.", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So given that, Brian, then did you guys ever think, gee, we could push a bit more on pricing, maybe let that retention settle in at a still phenomenal 84%, 85%? I know it's a tough balancing act, but is that part of your thought process?", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So every single day in the marketplace, with every transaction, that's what our underwriters are doing. They're working with agents and brokers in the Middle Market and in the Other Business Insurance stuff account-by-account, and they're trying to determine what's the appropriate thing to do for that account. You can get caught up in the arithmetic of what you just said. And we do ourselves at times, but it's not as straight a line to say, well, if you reduce retention two points and you raise prices X, that's not exactly how the marketplace dynamics work.", "But we are always trying to look at the retention rate trade-off and looking at that in the context, first and foremost, of the return that we believe we're generating on that account or that book of business and is it appropriate and where do we want to go.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "So we're balancing it all the time.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would take you back to the conversation about account-by-account execution.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Yeah. The graph that Alan referenced in his opening comments and...", "Jay Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Well, thank you for the answer.", "Brian W. MacLean - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Alan D. Schnitzer - Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi - Senior Vice President-Investor Relations", "Great. Well, this completes our call. Thank you very much for joining us this morning. And as always, we're available in Investor Relations for any follow-up.

We are very pleased with the record volume of premium that we wrote in the quarter and we continue to be very pleased with the amount of returns in the business we\u2019re writing.", "In our commercial businesses, retentions remained high and renewal premium change was positive. Underneath that, consistent with our very granular approach to execution, in middle market, we retained 90% of the premium from our best-performing accounts with only a modest decline in renewal rate change on that business. On our poor-performing accounts, we achieved renewal rate change in excess of loss trend. You might have noticed that renewal rate change in domestic business insurance was slightly positive as compared to slightly negative in the first quarter, and renewal rate change in middle market improved by four point, we don\u2019t forecast rate and we\u2019re not calling a bottom, but the significance of this to us is that the market remains remarkably stable and we\u2019re generally successful in achieving our written objectives.", "In terms of new business, we are actively seeking and finding opportunities that meet our return thresholds, and we delivered strong new business growth in our commercial businesses, including 10% growth in new business and domestic business insurance.", "In personal insurance, net written premiums grew 9% to a record of over $2.1 billion, with accelerating momentum in both auto and homeowners. New business was up 21% year-over-year, driven by the success of the Quantum product. Quantum Auto 2.0 continues to meet our financial expectations and is successfully enhancing our market position. Our success in the market place across all our businesses really speaks to the value of the talent that we have in the home office and in the field, and their ability to leverage our data and analytics and work with our distribution partners to deliver great products and services and fair prices to our customers. Franchise value matters.", "Before I turn the call over to Jay Benet, I\u2019d like to acknowledge and thank all of our colleagues in the Claim organization for their extraordinary efforts and handling the claims of our customers, affected by severe weather and fire so far this year. These experts are on the frontline for us delivering on the promise we extend with every policy that we write and it has been a very active year so far for them.", "Their responsiveness and expertise are great to our customers and an important competitive advantage for us. In Canada, where we saw significant wild fires in the Fort McMurray area, both our customers and we benefited from the work we\u2019ve done to replicate our US claim model, which enables us to respond to large scale events with our own highly-trained professionals and resources without resorting to independent adjustors. So, all in all, solid results for the quarter and the first half, particularly in light of the weather and wildfires and continued excellent execution in the market place.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. As I did in the first quarter, I\u2019d like to start by saying that we were pleased with our results. Operating income of $649 million and operating return on equity of 11.6%, despite they\u2019re being lower than in the prior-year quarter. These reductions did not result from significant changes in underlying business trends, notably as indicated on page four of the webcast.", "The quarter-over-quarter decrease in operating income was impacted by among other things, PCS, cat events and lower fixed income, net investment income. Losses from PCS cat events was met or exceeded our threshold for recording as cat, which is $79 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter, while losses from PCS cat events has gone below our cap thresholds which we recorded as part of non-cat weather related losses within underlying underwriting results for $56 million higher after tax than in the prior-year quarter.", "And fixed income NII was $21 million lower after tax, primarily due to the continuing the low interest rate environment as we had anticipated in the outlook section of our first quarter 2016 10-Q. Everything else was pretty much a wash.", "We continued to experience net favorable prior-year reserve development, which totaled $288 million pretax or $192 million after tax this quarter, up from $207 million pretax or $133 million after tax in the prior-year quarter.", "The business in International Insurance, net favorable development of $138 million pretax or $94 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss in domestic workers comp for accident years 2006 and prior and accident year 2015. Better than expected loss experience in domestic general liability for accident years 2011 and 2015 and better than expected loss experience in our European operations partially offset by an $82 million pretax of $53 million after tax increased through environmental reserves.", "In Bond & Specialty Insurance, net favorable development of $150 million pre-tax or $98 million after tax, primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in Fidelity and Surety for accident years 2010, 2013 and 2014, and better than expected loss experience in GL for accident years 2007 through 2011.", "Year-to-date, on a combined-stat basis, for all of our US subs, all accidents years have developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. In addition, other than commercial multi-peril, all product lines have developed favorably year-to-date. While CMP developed unfavorably by $42 million year-to-date, you may recall me telling you in the first quarter that there was an offsetting favorable development in the Property product line, as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the Property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.", "Operating cash flows of $443 million were very strong, particularly recognizing that they were net off the $524 million payment we made this quarter as final settlement of the PPG asbestos litigation. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.75 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains increased to approximately $3.6 billion pre-tax or $2.3 billion after tax, up from $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $85.73 and adjusted book value per share of $77.61 increased 7% and 3%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year.", "We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned $747 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter, through dividends of $197 million and share repurchases of $550 million. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve retuned over $1.5 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Before turning the microphone over to Brian, there is one additional topic I'd like to cover, our cap reinsurance coverage. In addition to our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty, which we renewed at the beginning of the year, our cap reinsurance includes cap bonds that are specific to the Northeast US along with the Northeast Gen Cat Treaty.", "With respect to the cat bonds, one, that had provided up to $300 million of coverage for certain losses, expired as scheduled in May 2016, and given our current risk profile, we decided not to replace it.", "With respect to the remaining cat bond, which will not expire until May 2018, the attachment point and maximum limit will reset as required annually to adjust the model\u2019s expected loss of the layer within the predetermined range. For the year beginning May, 16, 2016, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond as losses in the covered area for single occurrence reaching additional attachment amount of $1.968 billion.

And with that, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. In business, the new international insurance, we're pleased with the results this quarter. In domestic business insurance, we achieved a very strong retention along with the modest increase in renewal rate change versus the first quarter and higher levels of new business. Our strategy has not changed as we strive to retain our best-performing accounts, get rate where needed and write new business when it meets our target returns.", "This has been our strategy for some time. And as a result, we continue to be viewed as the stable and financially strong market by our distributors and customers. Along with the meaningful competitive advantages that we deliver, this consistent leadership position is resulting in additional growth opportunities for us.", "Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $393 million with the combined ratio of $97.5 million. Cat losses for the quarter were $143 million net after-tax, which included $61 million from the Canadian wildfires. Excluding the Canadian fires, cat losses were slightly higher than the prior year quarter. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats in prior-year reserve development, was $95.5 million, up 2.4 points compared to the second quarter of 2015.", "The loss ratio increased by 1.7 points, driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than prior-year quarter and our expectation. The expense ratio was up seven tens of a point over last year, driven primarily by commissions as the second quarter of 2015 benefited from a one-time favorable adjustment.", "Net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior-year quarter with domestic business insurance premiums up about 2%. Given the returns that we are generating in this business, our focus continues to be on retention. And so, we were very pleased that retention remains at 85% for the quarter, renewal premium change was just over two points, including renewal rate change that was slightly positive. New business of $525 million was up 10% versus the second quarter of 2015.", "Turning to the individual businesses within Business Insurance, beginning with select, we achieved retention of 82% and renewal premium change of nearly 6%. Rate change was down slightly versus the first quarter of 2016, while exposure was in line with recent periods and new business was up slightly year-over-year.", "In middle market, retention remained very strong at 87% with renewal premium change of about a point and a half, in line with recent quarters. In terms of new business opportunities, given our leadership position in the market, submissions were up year-over-year. Accordingly, we had more opportunities to quote on the types and classes of business we find attractive and to grow our new business while maintaining our return thresholds.", "In Other Business Insurance, retention of 82% was up a point year-over-year, while renewal premium change was 0.5 and new business of $154 million was consistent with the second quarter of 2015. As we've mentioned in the past, Other Business insurance includes our National Property Business. While there continues to be some rate pressure in this business, returns remain attractive, and as a result, retention is our priority.", "As you can see, on Page 13 of the webcast, excluding National Property, renewal rate change for Other Business Insurance remains positive and was relatively consistent with recent quarters. In International, net written premiums for the second quarter were down about 12% quarter-over-quarter, excluding the impact of foreign exchange, net written premiums were down about 9%, driven by disciplined underwriting actions in our UK business, along with lower economic activity impacting the Marine and energy lines of our Lloyd's business.", "New business of $107 million was up 67% year-over-year, driven primarily by Optima, our new strategic Personal Lines Auto product in Canada, which was modeled after our US-based Quantum Auto 2.0 product, so always a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.", "I'll turn now to Bond & Specialty Insurance where we had another terrific quarter. Operating income of $202 million was up significantly from the prior-year quarter, driven by a higher level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 80.9% remains exceptionally strong. As for topline, net written premiums for the quarter were in line with the prior year, as growth in Management Liability was offset by lower Surety premium. The lower Surety volume was due almost entirely to favorable one-time reinsurance impacts in the prior-year quarter.", "Across our Management Liability business, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts, underwriting more business in our return adequate product segments. We continue to feel great about this segment's performance.", "In Personal Insurance, results were again strong and remain particularly pleased with our ability to add topline growth at appropriate financial returns. Net written premiums for the quarter up $2.1 billion were an all-time high with double-digit growth in Agency Auto, while growth also accelerated in Agency Homeowners and other. In both products, we continue to produce strong retention and new business levels. Agent and consumer receptivity to Quantum Auto 2.0 remains exceptional and importantly, as significant amount of Quantum Auto 2.0 business are now coming through their renewal cycles, we're pleased with the retention rates we're seeing on those policies. In Homeowners, our growth momentum is building due to crossover benefits from Quantum Auto 2.0, as well as pricing changes and improvements to Agent and customer experience.", "Turning to profitability, operating income for the segment was down compared to the prior year quarter, due primarily to lower net favorable prior-year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 89.5% was in line with our expectations, but up about point from the prior year, driven by the impact of the significant new business volume in recent years and normal quarterly volatility in weather and other loss activity.", "In Agency Auto, the 101.3 combined ratio included 2.7 points in cash, primarily resulting from hail storms. Weather also impacted the underlying combined ratio with 1.7 points of non-cat weather-related losses, which is approximately one point higher than both our expectations and the second quarter of 2015. The remaining increase in the underlying combined ratio was driven by the high levels of new business that I just mentioned. As we've noted before, the Quantum Auto 2.0 business is priced to our long-term target returns and loss experiences performing in-line with our expectations.", "Turning to Agency Homeowners and other, underlying financial results remain strong. The second quarter underlying combined ratio of 78.2% is well within our target return levels as we continue to execute our disciplined underwriting and pricing strategies. So overall, for Personal Insurance, we feel great about the growth in the financial returns that the business is generating.", "Before I turn it back to Gabby, I would like to take a moment to recognize Doreen Spadorcia who announced her retirement from Travelers' effective September 1st of this year. Over the past 30 years, Doreen has played an important role on our management team, and we wish her well as she enjoys a new chapter of her life. With that, let me turn it over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you, Brian. Tina, we are now ready to start the Q&A portion of the call if I could ask the participants to limit yourself to one question and 1 follow-up, please. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Randy Binner of FBR and Co. Please go ahead.", "Randy Binner", "Hey, Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to talk about the underlying combined ratio in business and international. And I think in the comments and in the press release, you attributed the increase of 2.4% to non-cat weather, but as well as loss cost not being covered by earned pricing. And so, I think - can we get more granular on that, because we\u2019re at a point in the cycle where not covering loss cost with earned trend is potentially an issue and just wanted to get a better detail on that.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure, Randy, it's Alan, I'll take that. So the underlying combined ratio in that segment, you're right, was down 2.4 points. Part of that was commission and that was a year-over-year comparison thing, nothing going on there. The other piece of that was in the loss ratio, the majority of that does come from non-cat weather. There is a relatively small piece of earned rate versus loss trend coming through. And one of the reasons we showed you Page four in the webcast was to try to put that in a little bit of context. So really what's impacting year-over-year is the weather. You get, as we said before, we tried to make clear that rate and loss trend is one small piece of what goes on, but there is also taxes, expenses, base year, mixed - the impact of changes in claim handling, things like that. Everything else, as we would've expected was a wash. So, there is nothing in that that earned rate versus loss trend that was surprising to us or that we think shouldn't had been evident from the return information we\u2019ve provided over the last year or so.", "Randy Binner", "Is that - is the piece of it, though, that's the loss trend versus earned pricing, is that - I think you're saying that it\u2019s not surprising you, but it does seem to be changing, is it a bigger piece of the equation than it has been in the last few quarters?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s the earned impact of what we\u2019ve been disclosing is written over the past year. So it's earning in as we would've expected and we called it out just in the interest of transparency. But again, nothing that surprises us and given where our return and earned returns are, nothing that we\u2019re not comfortable with.", "Randy Binner", "And then just finally\u2026 Sorry, go ahead.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would just say - as I said in my prepared remarks, Randy, we're very comfortable with the model returns on the business we\u2019re writing, and so just to give you a little bit more context.", "Randy Binner", "And then with non-cat whether, this would be truly episodic, nothing trend wise you\u2019ve seen in that?", "Alan Schnitzer", "That's correct. Nothing trend wise and that, it's all volatility and non-cat weather.", "Randy Binner", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Kai Pan", "Good morning. First question is on the pricing, slight uptick in the second quarter. Could you give a little bit more granularity in term by lines or by count size, what do you see underlying sort of trends there in terms of both by - from supply and demand side. And what do you see could potentially be the upside pricing as well as downside to that pricing?", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah, Kai, so this is Brian. I\u2019ll start, a couple of broad dynamics. Not surprisingly, Auto was the line where we're seeing the most positive pricing movement. Comp is, I think, the line with the most pressure, and that's, I think, really consistent with workers comp, if you see what\u2019s coming out of NCCI and other competitors, that's not surprising. From an account size perspective, larger accounts under more pressure, so we've talked a lot and others have talked about a large property business. We think that's somewhat consistent with the returns that have been in that business, but some pressures are there, I think, even larger casualty business is under a little more pressure than the middle and small type of business. I don\u2019t think from an industry perspective, there is anything appreciable, but that would be the broad strokes.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. Then a follow-up on the reserve side, looks like reserve continued to be strong. And I just want to focus on those three areas. One is that, workers comp released in 2015, is that sort of like - is that too early for a long-term on the business. And secondly, the $82 million environmental charges, looks like we are having those amounts for - at least for the last five to six years, just wondering any, like, why wouldn't you book, if you know the pattern is there, why wouldn't you book a big charge upfront. And then the third piece is a pretty strong, like a bond, especially continue to release that any underlying loss cost trend there will be appreciated. Thank you so much.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Kai. This is Jay Benet. Let\u2019s try to take them in order. So, as far as the workers comp, you're absolutely right, when you have a very long tail line of business, you look very, very carefully at things that happened in the short-term and don't necessarily react to them. In the case of workers\u2019 comp, what you're seeing here is favorable development in 2015 that related to a relatively short component of it relating to medical where medical bills come in quickly, they get resolved quickly, and the assumption that we had put in there for medical inflation was just too high.", "So while the line itself is a long tail line, there are components of it that are more short tail, and that's primarily why we reacted to there. As far as the environmental piece is concerned, I think, if you look at us, as well as the industry, you'll see a similar pattern, if you will, of people trying to, at various points in time, estimate what the ultimate is going to be for environmental losses, and recognizing that you're dealing with something that is a very difficult kind of reserve to truly evaluate. So, in doing so, you have to make various assumptions as to what the future is going to look like in terms of new claims, new policyholders, what the average frequency and severity might be associated with things that have been reported or not reported.", "And it's those assumptions that you're constantly updating as time goes on. So what we disclosed, I\u2019ll point you to the 10-Q, what we disclosed this year is actually very similar to what we've disclosed in prior periods and what you've seen other companies disclose that there really hasn't been a change in the environment per se, things have gotten a little better, but the rate of them getting better has just been less than - previously assumed or hoped for, and that's a chunk of the reserve addition.", "In addition to that, we\u2019re always subject to judicial rulings or other things to take place episodically in various jurisdictions. There was one that came out of the Northwest, increased modestly, some of our claim cost there that we also recognized.", "And then finally, on the Bond & Specialty, this was a quarter for a fairly large prior reserve development benefit. I wouldn't say there was anything unusual about it. This is, as you know, it's a high severity low frequency business. It's one where information emerges slowly. As it emerges, you're always evaluating whether or not it's blossomed to a level where you really feel action is appropriate. So, there are things that have been taking place whether it's in items related to the financial crisis or whatever that we\u2019ve been watching, but things got to a point this quarter where we recognized that it was appropriate to take some reserve action. It wasn't any one product line, it wasn't any one particular claim or things like that, it was pretty much spread across the whole Management Liability and Surety book of business.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Michael Nannizi", "Thanks so much. Can you talk a little bit about, when we talked about non-cat weather in BI and Personal Auto.? Can you talk about non-cat weather in homeowners\u2019 book and how that has looked recently?", "Brian MacLean", "Michael, this is Brian, again. In this quarter, similarly there was some, but not to the same degree. So just to quantify this, as I said about a point on the Auto side, it was probably about half-a-point on the Personal Property side of some impact there, so some, but not as dramatic of that, again, that specifically the PCS event.", "Michael Nannizi", "Got it. I guess I am just curious because it looks like in the last few quarters, like especially in BI, we've talked about non-cat weather impacting the underlying and sort of a driver for the year-over-year comps being negative. And then in Auto, it looks like it was a factor this quarter as well, but when I look at my estimates and your results over the last several quarters, Homeowners has been consistently better. And I think better even relative to your outlook as you've disclosed in your Qs. So, I\u2019m just trying to understand how - why the impact is potentially disproportionate in these areas, because the nature of the risk is different or reinsurance or something else that's causing non-cat weather to be - it looks like a tailwind in one and potentially a headwind in the others.", "Michael Klein", "Yeah, Michael, this is Michael Klein. I think what you're seeing is a combination of factors in the Home product and weather is one of them. In the case of this quarter, I think what you see is, to Brian\u2019s point on the net impact, it's a couple of moving parts underneath. You\u2019ve got the weather impact, but we also have sort of underlying experience on fire, non-weather water losses. That again, also fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. So when Brian talked about weather and other normal quarterly fluctuations, that's really what he\u2019s talking about and this quarter was an example of that where we had some other non-cat weather, again, non-weather water, fire experience that came in better than expected. And importantly, for the year-over-year comparison, this quarter, there actually was a significant individual risk fire loss in the second quarter of last year that helps the quarter-over-quarter comparison just to give you a little bit of color on that.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. That's very helpful, thanks. And then, maybe Brian, on BI, so it sounded like from Alan\u2019s comments that the lift in the expense ratio was commissioned related. I'm guessing that means that it should continue, because I'm also just sort of trying to square that, because at 33, no, it\u2019s not, okay.", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah, the commission - last year in the second quarter, we had a takedown in our contingent commission accrual that reduced the number. So that created a year-over-year kind of difference.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah. The delta is not really in the base commission, so delta is in these other things that caused quarter-to-quarter variances.", "Brian MacLean", "Yeah.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. But I guess my other point is so the 33.3 expense ratio in this quarter, forget the comps, but just the app number this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about, because it sounds like there was some one-offs last year, but this quarter, is that how we should be thinking about the expense ratio from here?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It's Alan, Michael. I guess I would say that we try not to forecast on these individual pieces, but what I\u2019d suggest is maybe you go back over the last - I don\u2019t know, somewhere between two and four quarters and average the number and maybe use that as sort of a proxy for a go-forward number, but there is always going to be some volatility quarter-to-quarter.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Okay. Got it. Just because it does scream relatively high when I go back, so it sounds like maybe there is some volatility, I was just trying to understand what drove just some episode of higher expense ratio that should cause that to normalize as you\u2019re sort of suggesting, it should, but maybe I can follow up afterwards. Thanks.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Thanks. Our next question comes from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.", "Ryan Tunis", "Hey, thanks. My first question I guess is for Brian. I was just hoping for a little bit more color on what's been driving the solid new business growth in middle markets. I think you mentioned submissions are up, but I guess sort of like over the past couple of quarters that it has been pretty strong and just sort of what you're seeing on the new business front?", "Brian MacLean", "I think it's a couple of factors. We believe, as I tried to say in my comments, driven by the factor, I think we're in a pretty strong position in the marketplace. We\u2019ve been executing in a very stable and effective way, I think for a long period of time. We've got some real competitive advantages. The overall market is pretty stable, but there has been some pretty well publicized dislocations, and at least a couple of very large carriers had been very open about taking profit, improvement actions, and so that's created some specific opportunities, but I think, we think more broadly, has also created a little bit of a mood in the marketplace of flight to quality.", "So like I said, we've seen our submission activity up a decent amount and we've also, consistent with that, been driving a message to our organization, not strategically to do anything different with returns, but to be more active, and to be out there quoting more. So, just to be blunt about it, we're pushing our place pretty hard right now to be real active in the marketplace and get out of the quotes and not compromise on returns, but try to meet the opportunity of the submission activity, and that's been paying off in specifically our core middle market, commercial accounts business and the construction areas.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Ryan, I would add to that that part of our motivation behind pushing little bit more activities, just where returns are, product returns in the marketplace after five or so years of price increases, and so there is a lot out there that's potentially attractive to us, consistent. This is really important, consistent with our return objectives. So we're not making any compromises on that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. That makes a lot of sense. I guess my other question was just looking at the margin trajectory in Agency Auto and how to think about that on a go-forward basis. I guess, year-to-date, there have been a couple of things that have been - that seemed to have been weighing on the loss, actually on loss ratio some, is the new business drag, then there is the elevated non-cat weather, but something that we were a little bit - interesting was looking at the 10-Q, it looks like the language looking in to 2017 was that margins would remain kind of where they have been. And I'm just kind of curious, as you lap the elevated new business and you get rid of the lower non-cat weather, why would margins not be improving kind of as you look out into 2017?", "Brian MacLean", "So I think, just a couple of quick comments and I will pass it to Michael. Certainly, we view that the non-cat weather as episodic, and so we think that should absolutely return to normal levels. On the new business dynamic, the good news is that we continue to write some significant levels of new business through that product. So we feel great that we are building real embedded value in that portfolio, but it is going to take longer. The stronger the production topline is, the longer it is going to take for that to really work through the loss ratio. The other point I'd make is, the Quantum 2.0 product also was designed to have a lower expense ratio and a little bit higher on loss side. So you have to look at the combined in total to get that product. So...", "Michael Klein", "Brian, if I can just clarify something. One of the things we actually added to the Q this quarter was in the outlook section, we have previously spoken to underlying underwriting margins. So we thought it was important to add combined ratio, because people often use those terms interchangeably. And as you know, the combined ratio is a function of the premium volume, whereas, the margins are just dollars. And just to clarify what we're saying here in the Q is, for Auto, which I think is what we're talking about, the early part of '17, the company expects underlying underwriting margins, the dollars to be slightly higher because of what's taking place with writing higher volumes of business, that's profitable. But writing a higher percentage of new business relative to the base is also causing a slight uptick in the underlying combined ratio. So, you have this feature here where the dollars are going up, at the same time that the combined ratio is going up. So I just wanted to clarify that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Yes. That\u2019s helpful. I think I was a little bit confused by that. Thanks guys, appreciate it.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Ryan, the other factor just to know it's not all this new business impact from what we are writing. As Michael explained a second ago, we haven't had this last quarter or so, this favorable non-weather loss activity. And as we also highlighted in 10-Q, we expect that to return to a more normal level. So that's also having on a go-forward basis, a slight adverse impact.", "Michael Klein", "This is Michael Klein. We\u2019re looking at what is underneath just to reiterate, right, Quantum Auto 2.0 is priced at the same return level as the book of business has been priced to. So it really is the dynamic of preponderance of newer I think of it as younger business, right, the portfolio is getting younger because of the outsized growth that we've seen over the last couple of years. But the long-term return targets for the product will remain consistent with where they have been.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please go ahead.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks, and good morning. Two quick questions, probably these are follow-ups. And I apologize if I'm still not clear. Just going back to the discussion on BI and what Randy was asking, if you ex out all the moving parts, and just focus on the underlying discussion on the negative loss cost trends versus on pricing, is it episodic as what you're seeing or is this - the usual sort of trend line, i.e., you've talked about this in the past that overtime this equation will get flipped, and now we're at the point where it has flipped. I'm just trying to understand that.", "Alan Schnitzer", "It's not episodic. There is a trend there, but I think what we've told in the past is, there is some danger to looking at that very narrow definition of rate versus loss trend. And obviously, anybody could look at rate which is sort of around zero and loss trend, which is something north of zero on a written basis, and it has been moving in that direction for some number of quarters, so as anybody as we would've expected, as that earns in over time, there will be some negative pressure on margin. But what we've said in the past is you've got to look at that in the context of all the other moving pieces that impact underlying underwriting margin, things like we have a tax impact year-over-year this quarter, there is expenses, there is base years, there is mix, all those other things go into that number, and what we've shown you this quarter is all that comes out to about a wash. And I guess, I'd also point you to the outlook where we give you a sense of over the next four quarters or so that we would expect underlying underwriting margins obviously subject to the volatility of weather and whatnot to continue to be broadly consistent.", "Brian MacLean", "The other thing I\u2019d emphasize, this is Brian, is that there's a lot of things in there that we have to react to, and there are other things in there that we are actively managing. And so, you shouldn't have the impression that we are just sitting by, and as Alan just said, pricing is at roughly zero this quarter, rate and loss trend is something north of that that we're just conceding that margins will recede. We are managing our mix, we're taking actions in underwriting selection, we're taking actions in claim execution, which are all impacting our loss trend. And then, we are reacting to weather volatility, et cetera, that might be moving through the business. So there is no denying that the sheer arithmetic of that narrow piece, the loss trend in the rate right now is a negative. We've said in the past that it's relatively modest, and it continues to be relatively modest, and then there are all the other impacts that are going through.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That's a fair comment. The second question I had was just going back to the discussion on Quantum 2.0. In the past, when we\u2019ve talked about loss cost trends, frequency was pecked at 0.5, severity was at 2.5. Has there been any evolution in that number or is it still the same?", "Brian MacLean", "No. We didn't see anything different in the core underlying trends of what was going on in the Auto book. So we would be at exactly those numbers you just said, about 0.5 frequency, 2.5 severity. And as we\u2019ve said in the Quantum Auto 2.0 specifically, still running consistent with our loss expectations.", "Amit Kumar", "Yeah, got it. That\u2019s all I have. Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Charles Sebaski", "Thanks for getting me in. I guess I'd like to follow-up again on, following [indiscernible] Quantum 2.0, and the Agency Auto book, and the clarity. I realized there is an additional disclosure in the Q, but how you guys expect the Auto book to evolve out. I guess, the commentary of early '17 being plus or minus 16, which is plus or minus 15, and you say that you\u2019re underwriting to a same return dynamic. But I guess, this has been a book influx that coming out of 2011 and '12 where it\u2019s been underperforming and the introduction of Quantum 2.0, just where is the run rate on what you should - what we should expect that - there is so many moving parts, but it seemed like there should be a story that was improving, and I guess, the commentary seems to be that it's maybe gotten as good as it's going to get. Is that right?", "Brian MacLean", "So the message absolutely is not, this is as good as it's going to get. The core from a profitability perspective, let me start with the top line perspective, because what\u2019s the story on Quantum 2.0. We have been pleasantly surprised with the traction the product has gotten in the business in the marketplace. We clearly went in with an expectation that this would enhance growth and we've done better than our original expectations there and you can see the numbers. So we feel good about that. And we are not sure where that's going to go exactly in the future, but we think that we're going to be able to sustain some pretty decent amount of growth going forward.", "From the profitability perspective, just as it is true of all business that we've ever written in this product, it matures over the years, and so there's a tenure impact. And as Michael just said, the younger tenured business is typically not as profitable as we write the business where we\u2019re targeting a tenured, longer-term return and we're on track to do that. So as this portfolio matures, and as Quantum 2.0, as we get more and more of the aging of the book, we believe the trend should absolutely be improving profitability on this business.", "Charles Sebaski", "Okay. I guess, on that, could you give us some additional insight on the tenure, the curing of the Auto book on what is the average policy life for you guys on this? I guess, when I think of some commercial accounts that might be longer, it seems that Auto still is a quick-return product. So this introduction of new growth, which has really been strong, what's the timeline for curing on an Auto book and how long do you average keep Auto policies?", "Michael Klein", "So, Charles, I don't know that I\u2019ll get into the specifics of the policy life expectancy, et cetera, but to give you a little bit more color, this is Michael, on aging of the Auto book, you have to really think about both components of what's going on here, right. So first, you need to think about a vintage and think about a book of business we're writing to given policy year, and that new business that we write in that term that comes on at a higher loss ratio early, and then as we renew, it improves. If you look at the production statistics that we've been disclosing and the high levels of new business, what's happening inside the portfolio then, which is the second piece, is on average the portfolio is getting younger, right.", "And if younger business carries a higher loss ratio, that's what we described as the increase in the combined. So when you look at the outlook for the first half of - or I'm sorry, the second of '16, we see the combined ratio will be higher due to the impact of the higher new business levels we\u2019ve been writing, that is the underlying dynamic that's flowing through the book, that does continue into the first half of '17, it just gets offset by an expectation of return to normalized non-cat weather levels.", "And so the underlying dynamic of the book getting younger meaning, less tenured, right, we\u2019ve had the accounts not as long, continues into \u201817, recognize also though that as we write more Quantum Auto 2.0 business, there is a benefit to the combined ratio from an offsetting improvement in the expense ratio, because it carries commissions. So that underlying ageing of the book or reducing average tenure of the book does continue into \u201817, it just gets offset by again an expectation of a return to more normalized weather. That\u2019s why the outlook reads the way it does.", "Brian MacLean", "It's an assumption, not an expectation.", "Michael Klein", "I'm sorry, it's an assumption.", "Alan Schnitzer", "So one of the point on that, so again, as Michael said, we\u2019re not going to give you explicitly the target we have for life expectancy on policies. We think that's part of our competitive kind of conversation. We clearly accept that hitting the expectations of retaining the business is important, which is why in my comments, I emphasized that as we are going into year two and in some cases year three for the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, we feel really good that we are hitting the retention rates we expected. So whatever our expectation was for life expectancy, along with our statement about losses are progressing, so is the retention of the business and you can look at our long-term retention and begin to deduce some kind of policy life expectancy by just doing the arithmetic.", "Charles Sebaski", "Thank you very much for the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you. I was hoping to get a bit more insight on the pace of share buybacks. It's slowed over the past few quarters on a linked-quarter basis. And the slowdown in share buybacks was actually a little greater than the reduction in earnings for the first half of 2015 to the first half of 2016. Can you give us a bit more insight on that?", "Jay Benet", "Yes. Jay, this is Jay. I think you\u2019re looking back at a period of time where, as we\u2019ve said in the past, over time, share buybacks are going to be enabled by earnings and all these pension contributions and whatever, it's the earnings of the place over time that will drive what the total share buybacks and dividends are and what you saw and I think you even ask the question in the past can we continue to buyback at levels that are higher than our earnings, well, this is the flipside of it. This is just an indication of the timing element of when we look and see what the future quarter projections are. They obviously come out to be whatever they will be and we\u2019re just taking the numbers in the particular quarter that we\u2019re doing the share buybacks over a longer term view to say in this particular quarter, 550 sounds like the right number. So I wouldn't read anything into it in terms of a change in philosophy or a change in execution, it's just going to be the, what we\u2019d refer to as the normal quarterly variation and the policy and a discipline that's been set for a long period of time.", "Jay Gelb", "I see. Okay. Thank you for that. Second one, what was the overall impact in the combined ratio in 2Q from non-cat weather? On a combined ratio basis?", "Alan Schnitzer", "We are looking.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay. While you're - if you have that number. I also wanted to ask about - I know the UK leave vote is not significant relative to Travelers in its overall business, but if you have any thoughts on that, I think that would be real helpful for us.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure. In terms of BREXIT, the most significant impact to us would be whatever it means for the overall economic activity, the amount of premium that we write out of the UK that relies on passporting is very, very small, it\u2019s something like 5% of our overall international premium and about half of that is to Lloyd\u2019s and we assume that one way or another, Lloyd\u2019s will address the passporting issue as will we by the way. A long way to go to see how that's going to work out and what the ultimate arrangements are going to be, but other than the overall macro impact, we don't expect any significant impact to us.", "Jay Gelb", "Appreciate that, Alan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Paul Newsome", "Good morning. And congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape in the personal lines business. We've had a few management changes of recent note, like places at Progressive and State Farm. I'm wondering if the components of who is being competitive out there have changed in the last year.", "Michael Klein", "Yes, Paul. This is Michael Klein. I would say broadly speaking, the answer to that question is no, I mean, competitive dynamics are very local in the business as well. And so while there have been changes in management at some national competitors and frankly, some local regionals as well, the broad competitive dynamics in the business remain consistent, when we look at the rate filing monitoring that we do in the business to assess the rates that carry and take in particular states in auto or home. We don't see a lot of shift in behavior there. So I would say the competitive dynamics are broadly consistent.", "Paul Newsome", "So, the general idea that the agency folks keep losing share and the regionals and the direct people are the most competitive? Is that still kind of really the case?", "Michael Klein", "I think if you look at the latest A.M. Best data, you continue to see some incremental shift in share by channel. Interestingly, I think consistent with the last couple of years, the majority of the games you are seeing in the sort of online direct channel are actually coming from captive and less and less from independent agency, but broadly I think those trends continue.", "Paul Newsome", "Great, thanks. Appreciated.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. Somebody asked the question about what was the impact on the combined ratio of non-cat weather. And one thing, I will give you the number but I also have to give a little bit of a preface to it. Now, we are parsing things very thin here and talking strictly about that. So if you have the question what's the impact of non-cat weather on a combined ratio on a consolidated basis, we would say 150 basis points. But I\u2019d also point out that if you ask the question about well what about other losses that goes in a different direction and what about mix and that goes in a different direction. So we will answer your question but there is lots and lots of things that are taking place here that makes the one number not necessarily indicative of the trends or of what's going to or what the expectation is. So I would just urge you to go back to the Q and the outlook to see what all of this to us actually translates into.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Jay Cohen", "Just to follow up, the language in the Q on the commercial - on the business insurance segment, you extended the commentary on the margin into 2017. Again, the broadly consistent language, I assume that\u2019s largely because of the first half of \u201816 at a high level of loss activity non-cat weather, is that fair?", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s right there are some large losses in non-cat weather that in the outlook we would expect to return to normal levels, we would assume.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Thanks and then the second question may be for Bill Heyman because he hasn\u2019t had a chance to speak yet. Obviously, as we would expect the non-fixed income returns are always going to be variable. Can you give us a sense given how the portfolio is constructed today, what is an expected return for that portfolio at this point?", "Bill Heyman", "Thanks Jay, I think an expected return for non-fixed income ought to be in the high single digits pre-tax. If you look at this quarter, we made a bit more real estate then we figured, real estate has two components rentals from properties we own, and NII from real estate funds. Hedge funds were below what we expected but positive and the big variable was private equity where the portfolio was almost flat maybe few million dollars and we would have expected about $50 million pre-tax. Now what\u2019s interesting is the cash flow from that portfolio has remained at historical levels. And it typically hasn\u2019t contained as much NII in the past. So, we still we would aim for a double-digit pre-tax return on these assets and if we didn't feel we can do that we probably would reduce our allocation. But I think a fair expectation is high-single digits pre-tax.", "Gabriella Nawi", "And the next question will be our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our final question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney. Please go ahead.", "Larry Greenberg", "And I apologize for going back to this but I mean just listening to some of the chatter that\u2019s out there this morning, there is something of a view that you guys elaborating on the pricing lost trend relationship in business insurance suggests that you\u2019re seeing or thinking something new. And if I hear what you're saying it really doesn't appear to be the case and I just want to be sure that I\u2019ve got that right.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Larry, it's Alan. Let me be very clear about this there is nothing that\u2019s changed there is nothing that\u2019s surprising us and everything is consistent with what we\u2019ve reported to you on a written basis over the last four quarters. The real reason we put it in there is we wanted to be completely transparent, it\u2019s a very small piece but we thought gee, if we didn't put it in there, you or somebody would have said to us, gee, how can this not be happening because we are looking at your written numbers over the last three or four quarters. So I\u2019ll just reiterate it\u2019s small, it's within our expectations, it wraps up with all the other things that are typically moving around in a quarter, it\u2019s about a wash in terms of the year-over-year impact and nothing - no message intended in terms of anything out of the ordinary, completely expected, completely consistent with what we've seen on a written basis and we continue to be very pleased with the model of returns on the business that we're writing.", "Larry Greenberg", "And then just my follow up, Jay in your discussion on non-renewing that cat on, I think you said that the reason was due to your current risk profile and I'm just curious about that comment and if you could elaborate a little bit on that?", "Jay Benet", "Primarily our cat program is one that products capital not one that really deals with income protection, if you look at where limits are and things of that sort and where the attachment points are, it's pretty high up there. So in any given period, we\u2019re looking at the entirety of it, where our property exposures are and just given the way the book has evolved over the last few years, we just felt that this wasn't really adding much on a risk versus cost basis so we decided not to renew it.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great, that's it. It concludes our call for today, as always we at investor relations are available for follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the conference call for today, we thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect all lines. Thank you and have a good day."]}

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 20, 2016.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2016 third quarter results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks, and then we will take questions.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our Web site, travelers.com.", "And now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Unfortunately, I need to start on a sad note this morning. This is my fourth earnings call as CEO but the first since we\u2019ve lost our friend, Jay Fishman. I know I am not alone in feeling his loss. Many of you have sent thoughts and prayers. Thank you, we appreciate it.", "All of us at Travelers take a great deal of comfort in knowing that we\u2019re carrying on in a culture of excellence, performance and innovation that Jay left behind. It outlives him. It\u2019s an enormous part of his legacy and we\u2019re grateful for it. To sum it up in Jay\u2019s words, we all feel remarkably fortunate to have known him and worked with him. At this point, Jay would have of course demand that we get back to work, so let\u2019s get to the results.", "This morning, we reported third quarter operating income of $701 million or $2.40 per share and operating return on equity of 12.5%. Our underwriting results remain strong as reflected in a 92.9% combined ratio and our net investment income is down only slightly from the prior year quarter.", "Across all our businesses, the third quarter was another example of the successful execution of our marketplace strategies, and generally speaking underlying trends have not changed. Pricing and retention remain stable and consistent with recent trends. In our commercial businesses, retention continues to be at historic highs with positive renewal premium change.", "In domestic business insurance, renewal rate change has improved a little bit for two sequential quarters led by our middle market business where rate has also increased sequentially month-to-month in the quarter. Underneath that middle market, we again achieved rate gains in excess of loss trend on our poorer-performing segments.", "We also benefited from a mix shift in our better performing segments as the loss ratio on the retained business in those segments was better than the loss ratio on non-renewed business, the results of managing the business on a very granular level.", "In personal insurance, we continue to achieve strong top line growth in the quarter with continued growth in policies in force in both our agency auto and homeowners businesses. We believe that being able to deliver an account solution to our customers and agents is an important and meaningful competitive advantage.", "More than half of our personalized premium come from accounts for which we write both auto and home policies. When we write both the auto and the home, we can be more competitive in the pricing for our customers since it creates higher customer lifetime value for us through higher retentions and a more complete view of the risk.", "While we manage the profitability of the auto and home lines independently, we also manage to a portfolio return. We\u2019ll be focusing more than usual on the performance of the auto business this morning but we shouldn't lose sight of the fact that the all-in combined ratio for a personalized business was 94.1% for the nine months, a very good result.", "Turning back to consolidated results for all three segments, underwriting results for the quarter were impacted by lower levels of net favorable prior year reserve development, higher non-cat weather-related losses and in personal lines higher-than-expected losses associated with auto bodily injury. Jay Benet will have more to say about the prior year development.", "The higher bodily injury severity in personal auto had a $29 million after-tax impact on the current accident year, $20 million of which related to the first and second quarters, a modest impact. Brian will discuss it in more detail.", "I'd like to highlight that we believe that the increase in auto bodily severity is environmental and not specific to the Quantum Auto 2.0 product, as we see it across all our personal insurance auto program and in our commercial auto and trucking books. In anticipation of this trend continuing, we are addressing it through pricing and we believe that the product remains positioned to deliver target returns over time.", "I\u2019d also add that it\u2019s important to understand that when trends change in any part of our business and they will, what\u2019s important is having the ability to recognize it and react quickly. We believe our leading analytics give us an important advantage in this regard.", "In terms of net investment income, fixed income returns declined in line with our expectations and we were pleased to see an improvement in our return from the non-fixed income portfolio. All of this resulted in a very strong operating return on equity in the quarter and year-to-date. Given the continued historically low interest rate environment and the other items impacting our results this quarter, we\u2019re particularly pleased with that result.", "In terms of the strategy going forward, you can expect more of the same. In this low interest rate environment, we\u2019re underwriting matters more than ever. We have significant competitive advantages in our data and analytics expertise, claim and risk control capabilities and talent. Combining that with our active capital management strategy, we remain well positioned to continue to deliver industry-leading returns over time.", "And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. Consistent with what we had said about the first two quarters of the year, we are once again pleased with our results this quarter; operating income of $701 million and operating return on equity of 12.5% notwithstanding their being lower than the prior year quarter.", "As in the first half of the year, these reductions did not result from fundamental changes in business trends, rather as Alan said, they were primarily driven by lower net favorable prior year reserve development and higher non-cat weather-related losses.", "Net investment income, which totaled $472 million after-tax, was down only 12 million from the prior year quarter entirely due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment on fixed income returns. Non-fixed income returns improved from recent quarters to a level that was slightly higher than the prior year quarter.", "We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $39 million pre-tax, down from 199 million pre-tax in the prior year quarter.", "The business in international insurance, net favorable development of $19 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experienced in GL ex-A&E for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2014 and 2015, in workers\u2019 comp for accident years 2006 and prior and for 2015 and in commercial auto for accident years 2011 and prior, partially offset by a $225 million increase to our asbestos reserves.", "The asbestos reserve increase related to a broad number of policyholders and was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed. Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, our overall view of the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods.", "In bond and specialty insurance, net favorable development of $41 million pre-tax primarily resulted from better than expected loss experience in fidelity and surety for accident years 2009 through 2015, while reserve development in personal insurance which remained favorable to-date.", "Homeowners and other had a modest amount of unfavorable development this quarter, $21 million pre-tax primarily resulting from higher than expected loss experience for a small number of liability claims related to the 2013 and 2014 accident years. Notwithstanding this current quarter activity, the homeowners and other 2013 and 2014 accident years have developed net favorably since their inception.", "I should also point out that the unfavorable development in homeowners and other this quarter did not result from any change in our reserve setting philosophy or methodologies. As we\u2019ve stated in the past and in our Qs and Ks, we always book to our best estimates and we use our advanced data and analytics to respond as quickly as we can to new information.", "By its nature, reserve development is episodic and in lines like homeowners and other, much of it has historically related to truing up estimated losses caused by storm damage. The number of severe storms in recent reporting periods, their timing in relation to the reporting period in which they occurred, the causes and severity of the losses such as wind versus water, the actual size and extent of any hail, the actual amount of additional living expenses provided, et cetera has and will cause significant fluctuations in reserve development from period to period. And changes in levels of reserve development should not be regarded as a \u201ctrend.\u201d", "Ex-A&E on a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development year-to-date. While CMP currently looks as if it developed unfavorably year-to-date by $37 million, as I pointed out in the second quarter, there was offsetting favorable development in the property product line as middle market property losses that had been recorded in the property line at year-end 2015 was subsequently determined to be CMP-related.", "Operating cash flows of 1.77 billion were very strong this quarter. We ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $1.8 billion and all of our capital ratios remained at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $3.1 billion pre-tax or 2 billion after-tax, up from 2 billion and 1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the year while book value per share of $86.04 and adjusted book value per share of $78.82 increased 8% and 5%, respectively, also from the beginning of the year.", "We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses and consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we returned 755 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of 193 million and share repurchases of 562 million. And year-to-date, we returned nearly 2.3 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn things over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business in international insurance where we had another good quarter, with strong returns and production results. We were very pleased that retention remained at historically high levels while we achieved positive renewal premium change and solid new business results.", "Turning to the financial results for the segment, operating income was $457 million with the combined ratio of 96.1%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.7, up 2.2 points compared to the prior year. The increase in the underlying loss ratio was driven primarily by non-cat weather, which was higher than both the prior year quarter and our expectation and about three quarters of a point impact from loss cost trends in excess of earned pricing. These were partially offset by lower large loss activity.", "Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in this segment, our focus continues to be on retention and so we\u2019re very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change was nearly 3 points including renewal rate change that was slightly positive, while we produced new business of $431 million.", "Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued to remain strong at 82% while renewal premium change was over 5 points and we\u2019re quite pleased that new business was up 7% over the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historical high with renewal premium change of over 2 points. New business dollars were essentially consistent with prior year with submissions, quotes and the number of new accounts written in the quarter up. The average size of accounts written was down slightly versus last year, but we're encouraged by the increased activity.", "In other business insurance, on Page 12, you can see that rate and RPC both improved in the quarter and retention remains strong. New business of $124 million was down compared to the third quarter of 2015, reflecting continued disciplined underwriting for larger accounts where we don't feel that market pricing will allow us to achieve target returns.", "In international, we achieved 82% retention with positive renewal premium change and a 46% increase in new business volume, resulting in a 4% increase in net written premiums excluding the impact of foreign exchange. These increases were driven by our new global construction and renewable energy groups in Lloyd's and continued success in Canada with our recently introduced personal lines auto product Optima. So all-in, a good quarter for the segment with strong production and profitability.", "Turning to bond and specialty insurance, this business continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $146 million was down from the prior year quarter driven primarily by a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio of 77.4 remains strong and well within our target return levels.", "On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were flat to the prior year. Across our management liability businesses, retention remained at historically high levels and new business volumes were up, as we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best accounts and writing more business in our return adequate product segments. So bond and specialty results remained terrific, and we continue to feel great about the segment's performance and execution in the marketplace.", "I\u2019ll now turn to personal insurance. Alan touched on the highlights. We once again had a solid quarter with a combined ratio of 92.9 and net written premiums reaching an all-time high of $2.2 billion. Auto continues to be the bigger factor driving the growth but homeowners\u2019 growth continues to accelerate as well, and both products generated strong retention and new business levels.", "We believe being a portfolio provider sets us apart in the marketplace and we remain pleased with the financial performance of the overall segment. The third quarter underlying combined ratio of 91% was impacted by an adjustment to our auto loss ratio that I'll discuss in a moment and year-to-date underlying combined ratio of 88.9 remained strong, a very good result.", "Looking at auto profitability, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was 101.1, up about 5 points from the prior year. About 4.5 points of this increase was due to the year-to-date impact of an adjustment we made to the loss ratio related to bodily injury severity for 2016, which, for the most part, reflects higher severity in our smaller claims. About 3 points of that increase relates to the first two quarters of this year.", "With respect to this change, I want to emphasize a few points. First, as Alan said, we believe this is environmental in nature; that is we are seeing it across all our auto products both in personal and commercial lines. Second, what we are seeing is from the last four accident quarters and for a long tail line like auto liability, that is very recent activity.", "Lastly, while we have been closely watching and talking to you about auto bodily injury severity for a number of years and reflecting it in our underwriting claim, pricing and reserving, recently severity has increased to a level that\u2019s a little more than we anticipated. In response to this recent trend, we\u2019re taking the appropriate pricing actions.", "Looking at auto frequency, overall year-to-date 2016 frequency is generally in line with our long-term view. That said, we have seen some texture within the year. Collision frequency for the first half of the year was favorable to our long-term view while the third quarter was unfavorable. We believe the frequency volatility that we've seen in 2016 reflects normal period-to-period fluctuations.", "As always, we are watching the data closely and will adjust if and when appropriate. But as of now, we have not changed our long-term frequency expectations. For perspective, the net adjustments we have made year-to-date related to collision frequency have less than the $3 million after-tax unfavorable impact. Normally, we wouldn't talk about a variance this small but given the amount of recent industry discussion on the topic, we felt that disclosure would be helpful.", "We've also been talking to you about the impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio for a while. So let me take a few minutes to walk you through the slide on Page 19 that we've added to demonstrate the impact of tenure on a loss ratio. Exhibit 1 in the upper left illustrates the underlying dynamic that drives the impact of tenure, namely that the loss ratio of the given cohort of business improves over time as poor-performing business defects and pricing segmentation improves on the business that is retained.", "Moving to Exhibits 2 through 4, of course, any given calendar period consist of a number of cohorts ranging from new to multiple years of age. In these exhibits, the curved line represents loss ratio by tenure, think policy year. The vertical bars represent premium volume remaining for those years and the horizontal line is the calendar period loss ratio for all cohorts, which is a premium weighted average of the loss ratio of each cohort of business during that calendar period.", "Exhibit 2 demonstrates a steady state growth scenario, think base case. During periods of consistent growth, the newer cohorts blend with the older ones and the calendar period loss experience will generate the target loss ratio. Exhibit 3 illustrates the impact of a higher new business growth environment where calendar period results are more heavily influenced by the newer cohorts of business that naturally have a higher loss ratio. This drives the calendar period loss ratio higher.", "Exhibit 4 illustrates a return to steady state growth at the higher levels of premium volume. The balance between the older and newer cohorts improves the calendar period loss ratio returns target levels, and in addition increased volume brings additional profit dollars. So obviously these are theoretical illustrations that raise a few important questions for our business.", "First, what is the current impact of tenure on our auto loss ratio? And the answer is that our loss ratio is about 2 points higher than it would've been excluding this tenure impact. Second, do we believe that our Quantum Auto 2.0 product is performing as expected? And the answer to this is that it has been maturing in line with our loss ratio expectations.", "Of course, we manage the business at a very granular level and monitor the book across multiple dimensions. For example, loss cost, retention and other proxies of profitability such as limits profile, prior experience and insurance score. In aggregate, based on all the data we have we believe this business is on track to produce appropriate returns. We clearly realized that the product is still relatively new in the marketplace having launched late in 2013, but three years in we are very pleased with the performance.", "Turning to homeowners, the underlying combined ratio for the quarter was a very strong 78.3, although up about 7 points year-over-year due primarily to an unusually low amount of non-catastrophe weather-related losses last year. The current quarter results is in line with our expectations and we remain very pleased with the returns we're seeing in this business. So stepping back from a lot of moving pieces in the quarter, this is a franchise with a year-to-date combined ratio of 94.1% and 9% premium growth; results we feel very good about.", "With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. We can now start the Q&A portion please. Before we get started, if I could please ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up, so we can get as many people on the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you. Good morning. First, my condolences to the Travelers\u2019 family. My first question is on the personal auto, thanks for the detailed explanation. If I look at the year-over-year, like for first nine months, the deterioration by 2.6 points underlying combined ratio, you explained about 2 points coming from new business and another point maybe coming from the rising severity re-estimates about $29 million for the first nine months. Is that the right way to think about it is that these two factors has driven the underlying combined ratio going higher? And then if you see your outlook, you\u2019re expecting actually improvements in the combined ratio into 2017. I just wonder what\u2019s that coming from; is that coming from the last track [ph], from the new business penalty going forward or anything else. Thanks.", "Brian MacLean", "So, Kai, it\u2019s Brian MacLean and let me clarify just a couple of things. So the two points that I referenced in my comments are that the loss ratio is elevated. You went to the delta year-over-year. That\u2019s about one point. So if you're thinking of where our combined ratio or loss ratio is relative to what it should be without it, it\u2019s 200 basis points but the year-over-year change, only 100. Another thing that when speaking \u2013 a lot of our commentary was to loss ratio and importantly remember in this business, as we rolled out Quantum, it was really built around a pretty decent change to our cost structure. So the expense ratio is seeing some benefit and going forward will see more as volume increases. So if you're talking combined ratio, there is an expense ratio good guy in there. The basic dynamics of what you were mentioning though are the right components.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Kai, it\u2019s Alan. As to the outlook, you're right. We did suggest it was going down slightly and we\u2019ve identified in the outlook three moving pieces. One, a lower level of loss activity just returning to a more normal level, rate versus trend as given our outlook for rate and loss trend and that's offset by the continued adverse impact to tenure.", "Kai Pan", "Okay, that\u2019s great. Then a follow-up question. Do you have any early indication from potential losses from Hurricane Matthew in the fourth quarter?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Kai, we anticipated that and we\u2019re happy to give you an early range but I do want to indicate that we\u2019re just three weeks post storm, so it\u2019s still early for us. And it could be influenced from here through the end of the quarter by large BI claims that come up that we haven\u2019t identified yet. So we would say our range at this point is $75 million to $150 million and that\u2019s pre-tax. And again, the risk factor going forward is going to be claims that we haven\u2019t seen or don\u2019t know of yet but they could come in between now and the end of the quarter.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner of FBR. Please proceed with your question.", "Randy Binner", "Good morning and thanks. I wanted to just talk on severity and just to understand what it is a little bit better. Is it that the actual injury and the bodily injury in these accidents is worse or is it a process by which claims are being used more to cover various medical conditions or is it a function of more aggressive trial bar or is it all three? I\u2019m trying to understand what it is that\u2019s actually driving the severity higher on the auto?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Randy, it\u2019s Alan. I\u2019d say you got it right sort of across the board. Generally speaking, we are seeing a high level of severity generally in the smaller claims and it\u2019s a little bit more aggressive litigation and a little bit more complexity in those smaller cases. You can\u2019t turn on the TV without seeing some kind of advertisement from the trial bar, so it\u2019s hard to pinpoint it with a high degree of specificity, but generally all those things.", "Randy Binner", "Maybe the follow up then is you mentioned that you\u2019re seeing it across your commercial and personal auto book in small case, if I got that right. So is it \u2013 what\u2019s the similarity across the classes and is it more people being involved in accidents, is that a piece of it too?", "Alan Schnitzer", "In some cases, there are more accidents of the vehicles and in some cases that is driving it. And generally we can just tell you that we see the same phenomenon across both books, commercial and personal.", "Randy Binner", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar of Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks and good morning. I was wondering \u2013 the first question is, if you could better help me understand the auto BI uptake. You\u2019ve obviously cited outside environmental factors, yet there was modest re-estimation for the first half of 2016. Why would that not be a Travelers specific issue? And if you look at other companies such as Allstate and The Hartford who have had similar issues, what you have learned is this is rarely a one quarter issue. So maybe just help me understand why it\u2019s external and not internal?", "Brian MacLean", "So this is Brian, let me do a couple of pieces of that. First, when we look at claim experience across our business and we see it in personal lines, in recently written business, legacy long tenured business across pretty much the entire spectrum of customer profile and we see it in our commercial business from small to large trucking, that tells that this isn\u2019t something specific to our underwriting some product we have a marketplace. So it would be in our view highly unlikely that we\u2019d see it that broad based and have it be just our issue. I would also talk to \u2013 I would completely agree with the comment that auto liability, any liability line of business, it\u2019s hard to see clarity in the near term. And so we\u2019re constantly watching these events. I am very confident though that we\u2019re as on top of this as anybody. And for reference I\u2019d say look back to commentary we had going back as far as 2011, 2012 into 2013. We were talking about liability trends, what we were seeing in the auto product relative to distracted driving relative to increased litigation relative to increased utilization of medical diagnostic tools and the impacts on bodily injury. And to be totally honest, there were a couple of years there where we were getting a lot of questions from folks on this call about why are you seeing something that no one else is talking about? And over the years, I think everybody has been talking about it. So I\u2019m not saying that we\u2019ve got it perfectly right or we ever do, but we\u2019re looking at the trends very, very closely. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last three or four accident quarters has been somewhat of an elevation, as we said, particularly on the lower end of the claim size but driving more complexity.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would also add. It didn\u2019t take us completely by surprise. Our loss PIPs [ph] had anticipated some increased severity. This was just a tick higher than we anticipated.", "Amit Kumar", "My second question is in the opening comments you talked about pricing actions. Does that indicate that we should anticipate a slowdown in Quantum growth? Why or why not? Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "So I\u2019m going to let Michael Klein jump in on that one.", "Michael Klein", "Sure. This is Michael. I would say the impact on growth will depend upon how our pricing actions compare to those taken in the marketplace. What I can tell you and it\u2019s very incremental, but if you look at the production statistics on the webcast, you\u2019ll see our pricing rise quarter-over-quarter relative to where we were in 2015, and yet the growth has increased. So our view of where we sit currently is while we have taken some price increases above where we were running, our competitive position so far has actually remained consistent, if not improved and you\u2019re seeing actually increased growth this quarter relative to the couple of quarters before. To the degree that we\u2019re right about this being environmental and we think it is, we believe the marketplace will respond and we think that our pricing actions will be sort of absorbed in the market. Could it have an impact on growth, it certainly could. But again, to the degree we think it\u2019s environmental we think we\u2019ll be in line what\u2019s going on in the marketplace.", "Amit Kumar", "Just a quick follow up to that. Would it actually be prudent to say we\u2019re trying to get a better handle on this issue, let\u2019s just pull back on growth? Let\u2019s get this piece right and then come back on the growth trajectory?", "Michael Klein", "What I would say to that is we are addressing what we\u2019re seeing with our pricing actions and focused on making sure we\u2019ve got the right price in the marketplace. The growth will be what it will be as a result, but our focus is on getting the right terms and conditions in the market to respond to this change that we\u2019ve just seen.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks\u2026", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re trying to get the right price on the right account. And based on that and the market reaction will determine the degree to which we grow.", "Amit Kumar", "I\u2019ll stop here. Thank you for the answers.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo. Please proceed.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi. Good morning. First on the personal auto book as well, when you guys think about your margin outlook in Q4 and into 2017, what type of increase in rates are you expecting from what we saw in the third quarter? And then as we think about the margin in the fourth quarter, I guess given the fact that you added to the current accident year, should we look for a sequential improvement in the auto underlying margin? And then one other, you guys did mention adding to the four recent accident quarters, so was there prior year adverse development on the auto book for 2015?", "Alan Schnitzer", "So that was a lot and quickly, so let me try to address what I caught and then maybe I\u2019ll ask you to repeat what we didn\u2019t get to. So I think you asked for the outlook on rate in auto. We don\u2019t give outlook on rate. We do provide outlook on overall price. And so I think you\u2019ll see that generally we are forecasting an increase in renewal price change, which is all-in rate and exposure. We don\u2019t quantify it any more than that other to say an increase. And I\u2019m sorry, Elyse, what were the other questions?", "Elyse Greenspan", "Well, I was looking \u2013 You guys had mentioned adding to the auto losses for the four most recent accident quarters, so were there adverse development on 2015?", "Alan Schnitzer", "There was a very little bit of adverse in the fourth quarter. It\u2019s obviously in the overall net PYD number, but it\u2019s a very small think after-tax single-digit number.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Elyse, it\u2019s Gabby. I think if I\u2019ve understood your question correctly on the current year prior quarter addition, it was 30 million pre-tax related to the first six months and then there was roughly \u2013 which means 15 million a quarter, which continued in the third quarter\u2019s '16 and can then use in the fourth quarter '16. Is that your question?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I interpreted your question to be, is there anything in prior year development related to this?", "Elyse Greenspan", "Yes, that was the question.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And the answer to that is in the overall net number of prior year developments, there is a single digit after-tax million dollar number in the fourth quarter.", "Michael Klein", "This is Michael Klein, offset by other items so there is no adverse prior year development in auto. That number is zero.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And there always is in PYD over the various accident years if you\u2019re going one way or another and the aggregate of those things was zero.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then one, if I may switch topics a little bit, in terms of your commercial line pricing view, with inflation levels looking like they could be picking up and reserved cushions for you guys and maybe some others starting to slow overall for the industry, do you think that it\u2019s time that some companies look to take price to kind of get ahead of the infection point if current trends continue as they are?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s hard to answer that. I certainly can\u2019t answer that question for anybody else. You can see what our pricing has done and in our pricing, the headline number you see is really the aggregate of the many thousands of transactions that we complete during the quarter. And you can see that it picked up a little bit. I will tell you that generally speaking, we feel like we are achieving the written margins that we\u2019re seeking to achieve today and feel pretty good about their product returns given where the tenure is. We do give you some outlook in the 10-Q for underwriting margins. So we\u2019ll see where the market goes.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks very much. On the excess capital position for the company, clearly Travelers continues to buy back stock and increase its dividend, although that pace of capital return has slowed for the year-to-date compared to the same period in 2015. I\u2019m trying to get a perspective on how much excess capital you feel Travelers holds now in excess of rating agency requirements?", "Jay Benet", "Hi, Jay. This is Jay. You\u2019ve asked the question in the past and when we go back to what we\u2019ve said at those times as well as in our Qs and Ks, ultimately it\u2019s going to be the earnings level of the company that\u2019s going to drive how much we return to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. As it relates to the specifics of excess capital, we try to manage the operating companies of two what the rating agencies require of us as it relates to being an AA company. In any given quarter, based on profitability of that quarter, we might end up with a little extra capital. I think it\u2019s very, very rare that we end up with anything less than we need. So it\u2019s not a significant number and it\u2019s just going to vary from timing. Ultimately, we carry our rating agency capital level in line with the AA over time and we return the excess. We don\u2019t sit on the excess capital.", "Jay Gelb", "All right, thanks for clarifying that. Alan, on the merger and acquisition front, essentially all the growth it seems in Travelers this year is coming from personal lines with little overall top line growth in commercial insurance. Is there any interest in accelerating the commercial insurance growth through acquisitions?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, Jay, we always give the same answer to that question. I can\u2019t tell you whether we will or we won\u2019t but I can tell you that I think our shareholders should demand that we have a view on what the attractive businesses are in every market that we operate in or might want to operate in and have a view on whether we won\u2019t to do them. We do think that we\u2019ve come together over a couple of decades through a lot of transactions. We feel like it\u2019s a competitive advantage for us. We\u2019re good at finding them. We\u2019re good doing the diligence. We\u2019re good at negotiating them. We\u2019re good at integrating them. So we feel highly qualified to do it and under the right terms and conditions, interested in doing it. Having said that, over the years we\u2019re also highly attentive to the risks; you buy the entire balance sheet, you buy system issues, you buy people issues. So we\u2019re very \u2013 I\u2019d say we\u2019re very aware on both sides of the analysis. But we are certainly interested in doing things if we can get them done on the right terms. And generally speaking for us, those are \u2013 we think about it through the lens of returns. Will a transaction improve our return profile and/or will it improve our volatility. And so that\u2019s the lens and we\u2019re always interested in looking.", "Jay Gelb", "That makes sense, Alan. Would that include large deals as well, something that might require issuing shares?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, I wouldn\u2019t make any distinction between a large deal and a small deal. All I can tell you is what the lens is through which we would evaluate it.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.", "Charles Sebaski", "Good morning. Thanks. I guess the first one, just a follow up back on personal auto really quickly. And I guess the question\u2019s on the timing of the rate actions that you guys took and what I\u2019m trying to figure out is with regard to the growth. While the PIF growth was obviously very strong, I\u2019m wondering if the severity issues were recognized at the close of the quarter and the rating actions are going to be perspective or these were rating actions that were taken at the beginning of the quarter and the 11% PIF growth was after those rating actions took place?", "Michael Klein", "Charles, this is Michael. I would say that we have been putting some rate into the market, first of all, throughout the year. The filed rate has started to rise in the quarter. I would say the growth in the quarter reflects some of that activity but just a little bit, and there\u2019s more to come.", "Charles Sebaski", "Excellent. Thank you. And then a follow up on the weather and the commentary on higher losses from non-cat weather. You guys already provide a lot of detail, which is very helpful. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us out a little further and give some kind of baseline of what weather losses are intended, I guess particularly maybe in like a homeowners line of business? I guess the commentary that losses are higher or lower in a particular period due to higher non-cat weather that isn\u2019t specific identified without a baseline is color what\u2019s hard to model or understand. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s some clarity you could give on a baseline for us on what non-cat weather should be and what the volatility is that through the year?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Charles, it\u2019s Alan. I do appreciate the question and why you want to know and also I\u2019d just thank you for acknowledging the fact that we do give a lot of color and texture and we try to be very thoughtful about that. This is one that we think a lot about and we think it\u2019s hard to do for a couple of reasons. One is, weather is just inherently unpredictable. There\u2019s a lot of volatility obviously and we don\u2019t know. We do have a plan. We do price for weather, but that reflects generally speaking longer term trends. So we just don\u2019t feel like it would be particularly meaningful for us to give you a plan for next quarter or next year just given the volatility. So we shy away from getting that specific relative to our expectations. But what I will tell you in case it\u2019s helpful is one a year-to-date basis for the company, weather was about \u2013 non-cat weather was about $70 million worse after-tax than it was in the prior year. So I know that\u2019s not exactly what you asked for. Maybe that\u2019s a little bit of color that would be helpful. But we\u2019re just a little bit hesitant to start giving you plan numbers.", "Charles Sebaski", "I appreciate the answers. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Thanks so much. Just back to auto for a second, if I could. Is it possible to kind of understand where the action quarter loss ratio is here at the beginning of the fourth quarter, or just post these adjustments that you made to the current calendar year in the third quarter? And then where is that relative to kind of where you wanted that business to be running when the sort of Quantum 2.0 effort began?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I guess we\u2019re looking at each other trying to understand exactly what it is you\u2019re asking. If you\u2019re looking for a view on fourth quarter, we\u2019re not really inclined to give any information about the fourth quarter yet.", "Michael Nannizzi", "How about where did the third quarter end? In terms of \u2013 so you made the adjustments to the third quarter, so I would imagine if you\u2019re thinking about your prospective trend then you\u2019re going to start with the third quarter, you\u2019re going to look at rate and then you\u2019re going to look at loss. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of what\u2019s your starting point for new business today?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Stepping back, if you look at it on the nine months and you look at PI auto, the underlying combined ratio was about 98. Is that helpful?", "Michael Nannizzi", "Yes.", "Alan Schnitzer", "That\u2019s for the nine months in PI and that\u2019s on an underlying basis ex-cat and ex-PYD.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Okay. And so that\u2019s in our numbers. Has that changed throughout the year or is that just kind of back to shareholders?", "Michael Klein", "Michael, this is Michael. I would just say, so for context on that underlying right, Brian talked about the fact that there\u2019s a point of impact from tenure year-on-year in that number. The other thing is if you take the bodily injury severity number and decompose that 45 million by quarter, it\u2019s about 1.5 on a run rate basis for the year-to-date. That 1.5 we expect to go forward into the fourth quarter. And the other thing I would say, just clarification on the fourth quarter outlook, the fourth quarter outlook says that we expect the combined ratio to be higher in the fourth quarter. There is a seasonality impact underneath that number, right. The combined ratio and the loss ratio in the fourth quarter run higher in the fourth quarter than they do in the first three quarters of the year. And so that\u2019s part of what\u2019s underneath that outlook number as well.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Got it. I guess one question I have, Quantum is \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s been very effective in a lot of ways. We\u2019ve seen PIF growth, the acceptance in the market, all of those things seem like a real positive. And then we have the sort of environmental trend that has been occurring like fits and spurts over the last couple of years. So taking those things separately, is it possible that the growth that you\u2019ve seen just might have occurred at a difficult time sort of before some of these loss trends emerged? And following up on a prior question, should that imply that at some point we should see that growth revert back until you calibrate those things, or is this still within your sort of expectations when you rolled out Quantum?", "Alan Schnitzer", "So let\u2019s go back a few years to where we were three or four years ago or two or three years ago when this business was shrinking in double digits. So we put Quantum Auto in and we took a lot of cost out, and we\u2019ve dramatically improved the overall profile of the business. So we shouldn\u2019t lose sight of that. This has been a big success. And a lot of the growth you\u2019re seeing is high in percentage terms, because it\u2019s off a smaller base after a couple years of shrinking. So, that\u2019s I think just important context to keep in mind. We don\u2019t go out there and try to manage the growth. We try to go out there based on everything that we see and price for the return that we\u2019re looking for. And based on the market, we\u2019ll grow or we won\u2019t grow. We feel very good about the growth. Maybe we don\u2019t have it exactly right, maybe we\u2019ll have to adjust, I\u2019m not really sure and honestly we could be adjusting up or down, not really sure. And this isn\u2019t unusual for any line of business that we have. As I said before, cost trends are going to change for one reason or another. We\u2019ve got other trends in other parts of our business that have emerged favorably. And so we watch these things, we think having the diagnostics and the ability to understand it, to diagnose it, to price for it is what\u2019s really important.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Cohen", "Thank you. I guess we hit most of the issues on the auto side. Can you give us an update on the workers\u2019 comp business? It feels like it\u2019s been relatively stable. Are you seeing any changes in that environment, either pricing or claims?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would say continued stable environment, no real change in the trends. Obviously, we had a couple of court cases in Florida that the overall market has reacted to and we\u2019ve reacted to. Those dollars weren\u2019t enormous for us. I think last year we had something on the order of $34 million, $35 million pre-tax that we added the reserves for those two court cases, so relatively minor for us. But other than that, no real trends from workers\u2019 comp.", "Jay Cohen", "Great. Thanks, Alan.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thanks. Good morning. My first question is just on thinking about the BI severity on the commercial auto side. It sounds like you guys are flagging this as an environmental issue kind of across all the wheels business. Is there a way that you can maybe help us think about the impact that had year-over-year on the loss ratio in commercial just from the severity in commercial auto?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Ryan, what I\u2019ll tell you is on the business insurance side, the proportion of premium that comes from auto is just much smaller than the same is true for the PI segment. So overall, the numbers are just less significant to that segment. There were some small numbers but nothing all that significant. The other thing I\u2019d point out is on the commercial line side, we have more flexibility to change pricing more quickly than we do on the personal line side.", "Brian MacLean", "The other thing I would add, Ryan, this is Brian is when you really look at the commercial exposure, when you\u2019re thinking of smaller claims that could be more of a PI thing. So the actual \u2013 we did have some activity on the severity side in BI this quarter. The dollars were actually less than PI. Obviously, as Alan said, the percentage was dramatically less. We actually had a little bit of good news from frequency in the current year; again, small dollars. So you don\u2019t see the impact as much, so a bunch of different factors going into it.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay, understood. And then I guess a follow up for Brian, I guess, on the impact of tenure. So I guess over the last couple years, it\u2019s been 2 points. If we would have had this conversation a year ago, it would have been 1. So the new business penalty I guess has grown year-over-year. And I guess this introduces the question of just how and over what time period can we really get that 2 points back? I guess especially when you think about the fact that Quantum 2, it seems like it\u2019s supposed to be a more competitively priced product. So over time, there should be a higher percentage of premium in new business. Just anything you can give us on getting that 2 points back, and whether or not you can get it back and keep growth anywhere close to where it is for Quantum? Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, so a couple of things and again this is back to the theoretical example. Although not possible, if you keep growing \u2013 you keep trying to chasing it, but if you keep growing with business that you believe has lifetime value that\u2019s meeting your returns, then it\u2019s all a good thing. And I get that that\u2019s a theoretical comment. We\u2019re not going to disclose exactly what the timing is, because that would lead someone to be able to triangulate exactly how we\u2019re pricing in the returns that we\u2019re \u2013 specific returns we\u2019re targeting. But the answer is, it\u2019s kind of a function of what do you think is going to happen to our growth. It\u2019s not going to reverse in the next year or two. It\u2019s going to take a while to play out. The other thing that is certainly worth noting is we talk a lot about the ratio. As we grow and it performs, we\u2019re generating profit dollars that are incremental to the franchise and obviously that\u2019s a good thing.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi, good morning. In the Q, you provide guidance that the personal auto combined ratio on an underlying basis could improve in 2017. What are your assumptions in terms of the auto BI severity there? Do you assume any further uptick or is that a risk?", "Michael Klein", "This is Michael. I would say what we\u2019ve said is that auto severity uptick is about 1.5 on a run rate basis. We assume that continues on a go-forward basis. There\u2019s always a risk it could change from here, it could change up, it could change down. When you look at the outlook, the outlook reflects the comments we\u2019ve made this morning that we\u2019re responding with price, and so the outlook I think literally says we believe price will exceed loss trend, which will be a good guy. The outlook says I believe that offsets some continued adverse impact from tenure. And then the other big component is an expectation about more normalized loss levels, which relates a little bit to the non-cat weather conversation we\u2019ve been having this morning and just a broader more consistent expectation on the loss level. So, again, I think the pricing and the outlook anticipate that the bodily injury severity, the higher levels of bodily injury severity are with us going forward but we\u2019re responding with price and believe that we\u2019ll get price ahead of loss trend in '17.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Great. Thanks for the answer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "This will be our last question. Thank you.", "Operator", "Okay. Our last question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg of Janney. Please proceed with your question.", "Larry Greenberg", "Thanks and good morning. And just about all my questions were answered, but I have one nerdy one. In the bond line \u2013 were you waiting for that, Gabby?", "Gabriella Nawi", "No, it\u2019s just it\u2019s such a great business and nobody ever ask questions. If we can inadvertent cheer for [indiscernible].", "Larry Greenberg", "The underlying loss ratio improved a few points. And I\u2019m just wondering, was there any re-estimation of the first half here similar to what you did a year ago in the third quarter?", "Alan Schnitzer", "There was a re-estimation in the quarter, yes, and it was an improvement loss ratio of 2.3 points. And so that\u2019s when you pull the first two quarters back in and add what\u2019s into the third quarter. So, yes, that\u2019s correct.", "Larry Greenberg", "Great. That\u2019s all I had. Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you all for joining. And as always, we\u2019re available for follow-up question and answer in Investor Relations, and we\u2019ll be speaking with a number of you in the next few days.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 24, 2017.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers' discussion of our 2016 fourth quarter and full year results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation, released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our Web site at www.travelers.com, under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chief Executive Officer; Jay Benet, Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, President and Chief Operating Officer.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials that are available in the Investor section on our Web site, travelers.com.", "And now Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning we\u2019ve released solid underwriting and investment results with record net and operating earnings per share for the quarter. Operating income was $919 million, generating an operating return on equity of 16.4%. This brings our full year operating income to nearly $3 billion and operating return on equity to 13.3%. That\u2019s in line with the 13.5% average annual operating ROE we\u2019ve delivered over the last ten years.", "During the year, we grew adjusted book value per share by 7% after returning more than $3.2 billion of excess capital to our share holders. Overall, our underwriting results for the year were strong as evidenced by our consolidating combined ratio of 92%. Underwriting results in business and international insurance were solid, and once again, we posted impressive underwriting results in bond and specialty insurance.", "Despite the disappointing impact of higher than expected personal auto bodily injury losses. Our personal insurance combined ratio for the year was 95.1%, demonstrating the value of having a balanced homeowners and auto personalized business.", "In our commercial business, we continue to be successful in the execution of our marketplace strategies. That resulted in continued historically high levels of retention and positive renewal premium change in the quarter, all of which reflects stable environment. In our core middle market business peer renewal rates change improved by 4 points from the third quarter as we continue to execute at a very granular level to achieve our written return objectives. I shall hear from Brain in terms of new business, we continue to be quite active in terms of submission and quote activity, but also fall in terms of underwriting discipline.", "Turning to personal insurance, as you've seen, the results by line were mixed. Our homeowners business once again produced excellent results and grew net written premium for the first time since 2011. In our Auto business, we're clearly disappointed by the underwriting results. During the fourth quarter, bodily injury losses were higher than expected and they developed unfavorably for the first three accident quarters of 2016 and the back half of 2015.", "Our claim data, the public chatter we hear from others in the marketplace and other third party data, all calls us to continue to believe that our experience is principally environmental as opposed to specific to us or a Quantum Auto product. Whilst trends change in our business, and as I've said before, our objective is to recognize it and react to the data we have as quickly as possible. We're taking actions to improve the personal auto profitability, and Brain will address this in more detail.", "Before I pass the mic to Jay Benet, let me conclude with this. 2016 was another strong year adding to our long-term record of delivering superior results. We entered 2017 with a great deal of momentum, and we're well positioned for continued success.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to Jay Benet.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. As Alan mentioned, we were very pleased with our results this quarter; a record net and operating income per diluted share of $3.28 and $3.20 respectively; operating income of $919 million, up 4% from the prior year quarter; and operating ROE at 16.4%. These results were driven by the continued solid underwriting performance as evidenced by our consolidated combined ratio of 90%, which included the favorable impact of prior year reserve developments which I'll discuss shortly, as well as the unfavorable impacts and cat losses of the $137 million pretax related to Hurricane Matthew and the fires and Tennessee, and higher than expected auto BI losses in personal insurance.", "The quarter also benefitted from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute and higher after-tax net investment income, which, after increasing sequentially quarter-by-quarter this year, increased 12% this quarter over the prior year quarter, all due to higher non-fixed income returns.", "Fixed income NII of $405 million after-tax was down $17 million from the prior year quarter due to the continuing impact of the low interest rate environment. Looking forward, into 2017 and based on the current interest rate environment and the specific securities that are scheduled to mature in 2017, we expect approximately $15 million to $20 million of lower after tax NII on a quarterly basis in 2017 when compared to the corresponding periods of 2016. This is a $5 million per quarter improvement for what we communicated last quarter due to the recent rise in interest rates.", "And of course, if interest rates were to continue to rise from the current levels, this expected decrease in fixed income NII would be reduced even further. In contrast of the decrease in fixed income NII, non-fixed income NII of $96 million after-tax was up $71 million from the prior year quarter, driven by significantly higher private equity returns.", "We continue to experience net favorable prior year reserve development on a consolidated basis, which totaled $264 million pretax this quarter, down a bit from the $292 million pretax in the prior year quarter. In business and international, net favorable development of $234 million pretax was driven by better than expected loss experienced in workers' comp and general liability. While in bond in special take, net favorable development of $75 million pretty tax resulted from better than expected loss experienced and fidelity and surety and general liability.", "Reserve development was unfavorable this quarter, and personal insurance $45 million pretax, driven by higher than expected auto BI injury losses related to the later part of the 2015 accident year. This corresponds with the increase in auto BI loss estimates that we made for the current accident year, which Brian will be discussing. In total, for the full year, we have consolidated net favorable reserve development of $771 million pretax with approximately $665 million coming from our U.S. operations and $106 million coming from international.", "As I\u2019ve done in the past, I\u2019m also providing you with some inside into what our combined 2016 Schedule P is expected to show when we file it on May 01. On a combined stat basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines, in the aggregate, would have developed favorably. On a Schedule P product line basis, all of our commercial products will show favorable developments or very modest amounts of unfavorable development.", "For personal insurance, homeowners will show a modest amount of unfavorable development, primarily resulting from the higher than expected loss experience, that I discussed in the third quarter webcast related to a small number of liability claims from accident years 2013 and 2014, and private passenger auto liability will show the unfavorable development that I just referred to.", "There are two topics I would like to cover relating to reinsurance. First, we\u2019re very pleased this quarter to have settled with one of our reinsurers in the USF&G versus AMRI at Elcase [ph], a reinsurance dispute that\u2019s been pending for many years. As result of the settlement, we recognize a $126 million pretax, or $82 million after-tax gain, in our fourth quarter earnings. I refer you to the Form 10-K that we filed on November 8th for more information related to this settlement.", "Second, as shown on page 21 of the webcast, effective January 01, we renewed our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty that provides coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year and at a slightly lower cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage part of $2 billion in excess of $3 billion after $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital, the treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions. And please note that the total costs of this treaty and therefore the reduction in costs are quite small in relation to our operating income.", "Operating cash flows were very strong this quarter, $1.14 billion, including the proceeds from the settlement of the reinsurance dispute I just mentioned, and after making $200 million discretionary contribution to our now fully funded U.S. qualified pension plan, bringing total operating cash flows for the year to over $4.2 billion. We continue to generate much more capital than is needed to support our businesses, and consistent with our on-going capital management strategy, we returned $942 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter with dividends of $191 million and common share repurchases of $151 million.", "For the full year, we returned over $3.2 billion of excess capital to shareholders through dividends of $762 million and common share repurchases of over $2.4 billion. Holding company liquidity ended the year at $1.68 billion, well above our target level. And our debt to total capital ratio, excluding the impact of net unrealized investment gains, ended the year at 22.3%, well within its target range.", "Net unrealized investment gains were $1.1 billion pretax, or $0.7 billion after-tax, down from almost $2 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively, at the beginning of the due to the recent run-up in interest rates and spreads. As you may recall, we generally as a buy and hold approach with fixed income investing, so any change in unrealized that relates to a change in the general level of interest rates is something we do not pay much attention to. Cash flows from the portfolio are what matter to us.", "Book value per share of $83.05 grew 4% from the beginning of the year. And importantly, adjusted book value per share of $80.44, which eliminates the after-tax impact of net unrealized investment gains, grew by 7% this year. With that, let me give the microphone over to Brain.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. I\u2019ll start with business and international insurance, where we are pleased with our full year financial and production results. We continue to generate excellent returns, achieving a combined ratio of 94.3%. Retention for our domestic businesses remained at historically high levels. And we successfully achieved positive rate change with renewal premium increases of over 2%.", "As Alan mentioned, retention for the industry remains very strong, reflecting a stable marketplace. And in that light, we were quite pleased that we were able to generate nearly $2 billion of new business premiums, up slightly from 2015.", "Looking at the quarters financial results, operating income of $722 million was higher than the prior year quarter by $156 million with a very strong combined ratio of 89%. Operating income included the $82 million after-tax gain related to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute that Jay mentioned earlier. This gain was in other income, and accordingly, do not benefit the combined ratio. The underlying combined ratio, which excludes the impact of cats and prior year reserve development, was 93.1. The underlying loss ratio was 1.4 points lower than the prior year due to lower large losses and non-catastrophe weather related losses, partially offset by a modest amount of margin compression.", "Turning to production, given the returns that we are generating in the segment, our focus continues to be on retention. And we are very pleased that retention for our domestic business remained at 85% for the quarter. Renewal premium change of two and half points included renewal rate change of seven tenths of point, which was higher than recent quarters, while new business came in at $439 million for the quarter.", "Turning to the individual businesses, in select, retention continued its improving trend and came in at a strong 83%. Renewal premium change was nearly 6 points, and we generated new business premiums of $92 million, up 7% versus the prior year. In middle market, retention of 87% remained at a historically high level, while renewal premium change was over 2 points, including 1.4 points of renewal change, or 4 point higher than the third quarter. New business activity, as measured in submissions and quotes, has been up for the year and in the quarter remained consistent with the prior year. However, as 2016 progressed, fewer of these opportunities met our underwriting standards and/or return objectives, and accordingly, new business premiums of $226 million in the quarter, were down 9% year-over-year.", "In other business insurance, renewal premium change was down slightly with a relatively flat rate environment compared to the third quarter of 2016. While retention remained strong at 80% and new business premiums up $121 million. New business volumes for other business insurance were impacted by the same market dynamics, I discussed the middle market.", "In international, production results were very strong in the quarter. Retention remained at 82%, while renewal premium change of over 2 points was higher than recent quarters with the biggest single driver of the increase being Lloyds, which due to the transactional nature of that market, is subject to variability. New business volume of $91 million was up 14% year-over-year driven by Lloyds, including the results of our new global construction and renewable energy groups.", "So all-in for the segment, it was a very good quarter, capping off the year with strong production and profitability. Before turning to bond and specialty, I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with those in 2016. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward looking statement disclaimers.", "I\u2019ll turn to bond and specialty insurance, which continues to perform exceptionally well. Operating income for the quarter of $161 million remained strong and was in line with the prior year\u2019s quarter; as in improved underlying underwriting margin was offset by slightly lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development; the underlying combined ratio of 79.7 for both the quarter and year with the full year result being an all-time best for the segment.", "On top line, net written premiums for the quarter were consistent with the prior year for both surety and management liability. In our management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts while writing new business in return adequate product segments. And so, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention for the quarter was a record 88%, while we added $41 million of new business. Renewal premium change of 2.3 points down about a point from recent quarters, reflecting the mix change impacting average policy duration.", "The other components of renewal premium change that drive profitability were essentially unchanged. So bond and specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and execution in the market. In terms of outlook as with business insurance, for 2017, we expect both the underlying underwriting margin and underlying combined ratio will be broadly consistent with 2016.", "Turing to personal insurance, net return premiums for the segment grew 12% in the quarter with a combined ratio of 98.2 and an underlying combined ratio of 93.2. For the full year, net written premiums grew 10% with a combined ratio of 95.1 and an underlying combined ratio of 90.1. So, overall, strong results for the segment, but results by line were mixed. In auto, as Alan mentioned, we booked further upward revisions in our loss estimates for 2016 and for the second half of 2015. The auto combined ratio for the quarter was 116.7 and include both the full year impact of the bodily injury related adjustments that I just mentioned, and seasonably higher fourth quarter loss levels.", "So instead of taking you to a detailed reconciliation of the quarter, it would be more productive to focus on the full year ratios. For the full year combined ratio, we had a 104.0 and the underlying combined ratio was 101.8. These were both higher than we expected and at a level that does not meet our target returns. For full year 2016 underwriting combined ratio included about 2 points from the 10-year effect that we discussed last quarter. As we said then, when you are growing your book of business, the higher levels of new business will temporarily increase the combined ratio and the impact of 10 year in the year was as we expected.", "In addition to the impact of 10-year, the full year of 2016 underlying combined ratio was elevated by 3.5 points due to the recognition of the increased bodily injury liability losses. This result represents a gap that we are working to close. You will recall that we reacted to signs of adverse bodily injury loss development with a reserve adjustment in the third quarter. Unfortunately, since then, we saw a further development in excess of even those increased expectations, which drove our actions this quarter.", "The deterioration is primarily driven by an increase in the trend towards more severe accidents. Some of the factors that lead us to this observation are a higher percentage of claims involving distracted driving, more accidents involving higher speeds and more accidents on highways and at intersections. This is also consistent with recent industry data. For example, the National Safety Council report of significantly higher traffic cyclicalities in 2015 and 2016, a two year trend that we haven\u2019t seen in decades.", "In response to these developments, we are taking action in the marketplace. Our primary response is to file for increased base rate. And in November and December of 2016, rate increases were implemented in 16 states, which cover about 60% of our quote volume. More rate changes at higher aggregate levels are planned for 2017 along with other ongoing actions to refine and optimize our underwriting process. The combined impact of these actions should be to both reduce the rate of growth and improve profitability. While it will take 18 to 24 months for the actions we\u2019re implementing to fully earn into the portfolio, we do expect that the auto combined ratio will improve in 2017.", "Turning to homeowners and other, our results for the quarter and the full year remains strong, and reinforce the value of a portfolio underwriter. The underlying combined ratio of 70.4 for the quarter and 75.7 for the year, demonstrate consistent performance relative to 2015. In terms of top line 2016 saw growth in net written premiums of 2%, and we look to continue the momentum in 2017.", "So, as I said, mixed results by line in the segment with challenges in auto mitigated by strong results in home, resulting in a segment combined ratio of 95:1 for the full year. We are fully aware that our recent auto results need to improve. Pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019re implementing should put us on track to deliver a more profitable portfolio in the years ahead.", "Finally, as it relates to our outlook for personal insurance, we expect underlying underwriting margins during 2017 will be slightly higher than in 2016, and the underlying combined ratio during 2017 will be broadly consistent with 2016. In agency automobile, we expect underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio will improve in 2017 compared to 2016. In agency homeowners and other, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be slightly lower, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly higher in 2017 than in 2016, reflecting higher and more normalized levels of loss activity.", "With that, let me turn it back to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. We're now ready to start the Q&A portion. Before we start, if I could just ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow up. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from the line of Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.", "Michael Nannizzi", "Brian may be a little bit on auto. If you could just give us some indication of how we should be thinking about the starting points for \u201917, and given the adjustments you made through the year. When should we start to see the rate increases flow through? And should we expect the starting point to be closer to the develop loss ratio picks you have said now for \u201816?", "Michael Klein", "Michael, this is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. I\u2019ll take a crack at that. So, I think you will see the rate increases start to flow through in the first quarter. As Brian said, we began making rate filings in the fourth quarter, really in response to what we saw in the third quarter. Rate filings that we\u2019re now making as we looked ahead to the first half of the year reflects the increased loss of content that we saw in the fourth quarter.", "Importantly, you don\u2019t see a lot of the fourth quarter rate filing activity in the production statistics, just because of the timing of those rate increases. They went in November and December, largely impacted renewals not until December. And so, it\u2019s really a timing issue in terms of not seeing and show-up in the fourth quarter of this year. But we would expect that you will see the rate momentum start to build in the first quarter of 2017, and continue from there.", "In terms of the starting point for 2017, I would say two things; first of all, as Brian mentioned that 3.5 points that you see on the webcast slide. He mentioned that represents a gap that we\u2019re looking to close. And so in other words that 3.5 points is built into our base-line expectations as we start 2017. And then we\u2019re taking trend and forecasting in actual word from that point. So, the starting point does include that 3.5 points of additional losses and the gap that we\u2019re looking to close.", "Brian MacLean", "Michael, just let one -- this is Brian. I would also just emphasize, obviously, thinking through the written versus earned dynamic with the rate. And as we obviously get it on a written basis, it has to earn-in overtime; hence, my comment of 18 to 24 months to work-through the 3.5 points.", "Michael Nannizzi", "And then when you think about the -- and most of your policies are 50-50 annual versus six month policies. Is that right, or somewhere in that range?", "Michael Klein", "It\u2019s a little bit more tilted towards the annual. So, it's about 60-40 annual versus six months.", "Michael Nannizzi", "And then Brian when you mentioned the margin outlook for \u201917 versus \u201916.does that contemplate that whatever trend you\u2019re seeing is sort of the need-year, and that we\u2019re not going to see more deterioration? Or does that contemplate that you\u2019re going to see that, the loss trend continue to increase, at may be some pace not at same levels we\u2019ve seen, or if you give some context there, thanks.", "Brian MacLean", "I think, as Michael just said, the 3.5 elevation is built into our expectation. Above that, we're expecting normal 3.5% loss trend, which includes more normal inflation of severity. But we don\u2019t expect another spike. Michael?", "Michael Klein", "I would say that just to clarify, so Brain mentioned the 3.5 loss trend. That is an elevated loss trend relative to where we've been. So the forecast, importantly, I think, it's important to take away that and includes both the increased base-line and a higher trend estimate going forward than we had in the past. It's modestly higher but it is a bit of an increase at front.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Kai Pan", "First question is just on the deterioration of fourth quarter. What exactly, sort of like if you are looking back in third quarter, what exactly sort of like accelerate in terms of loss cost trend from the third quarter? And just want to get the confidence that over that what you book in the fourth quarter. Do you think that's -- and it probably not be much matured like a deterioration from that levels?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. So the first thing I would say, Kai, it's all the normal stuff. Now, we're talking about very recent accident periods for a very long tail-line of business, so just as a perspective. At the end of 2016, we have paid less than 15% of what we believe the ultimate losses will be for auto bodily injuries. So, it's by nature a long tail-line of business, so it takes a while to play-out. We\u2019re looking at all of the activity that we see, both in frequency and severity of loss, cut every which way you can think of, and looking at frequency activity, incurred losses, the paid losses.", "And importantly, we're also, as we went into 2016, we're looking at that coming loss of 2013, \u201914 and early \u20182015 where we actually had slightly favorable development in the \u201913 and \u201814 years, and consistent experience in the early part of the \u201915 year. So we're looking at the history that we have coming into the year. As we went into \u201916, we started to see a little bit of movement in the fourth quarter \u201915 and early \u201916, but still within our range of expectations. We got to the third quarter, and those periods, again fourth quarter \u201815, first two quarters of \u201916, started to elevate above the expectations. Hence, we took the activity and the actions that we did last quarter.", "And this quarter, as we look at all of those periods. Again, now we\u2019re looking at the end of \u201915, early first three quarters of \u201916, and obviously, now another quarter of data. We saw a continuation in that trend that was accelerating. And we took what we think was the appropriate management\u2019s best estimate, given all of those factors. And we feel good about it but there\u2019re certainly no guarantees that we can see what's going to happen next quarter. I mean, Michael, if you want to?", "Michael Klein", "Yes, I think, that's exactly right. I think it's a combination of additional development on the periods that we saw before, and an additional quarter\u2019s worth of data that again reflects the fact that that adverse development continues through the end of the year. And we've made our best estimate based on the information Brain just described.", "Kai Pan", "My full-up on auto side again is that, if you look at this growth 13% year-over-year is actually accelerated from the last few quarters. As you increase price, do you think that one coming down? And do you think that 2 points of these are new business penalty impact will be smaller in 2017?", "Michael Klein", "Thanks Kai, this is Michael. I would say a couple of things, and let me give you a little bit of the moving part underneath this growth in the fourth quarter. We do expect, as we put rate into the marketplace and put additional rate into the marketplace, that our win rates will decline. So on the business that we quote, do we convert it? We\u2019ve actually seen, in 16 states that Brian mentioned, our win rates have come down as we put that rate into the marketplace. So, think of that as our batting average, our batting average is dropping as we put rate into the marketplace.", "The reason this growth is up in the fourth quarter is actually largely driven by the fact that we ended up with more as fast than we expected in the quarter, so quote growth is actually elevated. So we\u2019ve got more played appearances, if you will, but the batting average, the win rate, has actually come down in response to the rate. Again, we think some of that is timing, some of that, as we mentioned in the last quarter, the ultimate impact of the actions we take depend somewhat on the fact that we\u2019re in a competitive environment, and the impact on growth and a little bit on what happens in the marketplace.", "So our perception of what happened in the fourth quarter is we took rates so did the market. The rate impacted our batting average, but the rate also drove business into the market, which drove that quote growth. So the PIF growth is really a quote growth story, not a conversation rate story. In terms of your question about expectations, as we looked ahead, our actions are focused on two things; improving profitability and managing growth. And we expect, that\u2019s why I give you a little bit of analog for 2017 rate looking ahead into the first quarter, we would expect rate will rise and growth will drop as we look into first quarter. What ultimately happens will depend on how those actions play out in the marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please proceed with your question.", "Paul Newsome", "I wanted to switch the question onto the commercial business a little bit. And I was wondering if you could give just a little bit more color on the pricing environment in the domestic insurance business. And it's a little bit tough to read the tealeaves. But is it better or is it worse? Is there really any change from a competitive perspective in that business?", "Brian MacLean", "Paul, this is Brian. I will start, I\u2019m sure there will be follow ups to this. But broadly speaking, we feel good about the trends that we see. When you look across the data on the renewal book, we continue to see some, albeit modest, but pretty consistent improvement in what we\u2019re seeing. And we\u2019re encouraged by that. We think that might be somewhat reflection of the market. But fundamentally, I think it\u2019s a reflection of our execution. Our strategy on our portfolio remains incredibly consistent, and that is to look at in on a very granular or account-by-account or class-by-class basis. And simplistically, for the really well performing business, keep it at the best price that we can keep it at and the appropriate price, and then work hard at improving the rest of the portfolio. And when we look at that granular level, we feel really good about the momentum and also feel good about the aggregate statistics. So directionally we feel positive.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Paul, it's Alan. I would add to that that it's not just a market dynamic, it's in our execution dynamic. It's a very granular, as Brain said, account-by-account class-by-class. And I think in some respects and importantly it's the franchisee value we bring to the marketplace. So we look at an account and we figure out what we need to do to achieve the written objectives that we have. And I would say probably speaking we've been speaking.", "Paul Newsome", "How closely does the commercial auto business, or has the commercial auto business, track the results of the private passenger auto?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Paul, I'd say that we see a lot of the same trends in the businesses. There are different businesses. They have different starting points. The coverages aren\u2019t exactly the same; for example, on the personal line side, you've got uninsured and under insured motors, that's not such a factor on the commercial side. So I would say, broadly speaking, the trends are consistent. We see consistency across them. But the results don\u2019t actually come out the same for a whole host of reasons.", "Paul Newsome", "So we haven\u2019t seen the severity issue even at a level in the\u2026", "Alan Schnitzer", "No, I wouldn\u2019t think we haven\u2019t seen it. We have seen. It has impacted recent years. We see a lot of the same trends. But on the auto side, it's largely private passenger. On the commercial side, you've got a lot of trucking. So you've got different dynamics there. Also it just manifests itself differently. And on the commercial side, I mean on the personal line side, auto was obviously a bigger contributor to the segment more in terms of volume, so it just manifests itself more prominently. On the BI side, obviously, commercial auto is a smaller piece of whole, so it manifests itself differently. So we do see very consistent trends across books.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.", "Larry Greenberg", "So, I want to go back to the auto. And I appreciate that you think it's mostly environmental on top of the 10 year issue. But I guess I just want to challenge you a bit on it. And just question, whether you think it's fair to say that maybe you picked up on some of these environmental factors later than some of the others did. And if you agree with that, why do you think that's the case? And I kind of say this in the context of, when you were growing rapidly in auto and before you picked on the BI trends, I know you talked about being keenly focused on what was driving that growth. So I'm just curious on your thoughts on all that.", "Brian MacLean", "Larry, this is Brain. And I'll start with, there\u2019s a lot in your question. And we do believe it's a fundamentally environmental issue. We would never say it is definitively exclusively an environmental issue. As I think I said last quarter as I'm sure I said last quarter, Quantum 2 is a relatively new product that we\u2019re working now. And accordingly we are very atoned to looking at how it is performing and always looking to improve it. I would not agree with your statement that we are late to seeing the fundamental trend of what's going on in bodily injury severity. And without doing a long history, you can go back 2011, 2012, 2013, we were talking about this a lot, distractive driving and speeds are not brand new things, and we were talking about it then.", "We got to \u201913 and talked about a elevated level of bodily injury, and we were hoping that that would remain pretty constant. And we went through about two year period, 2013, 2014 into 2015, where we saw very constant, again elevated levels but constant with our expectations, of what we were getting in bodily injury. In fact, 2014 has developed favorably and we continue to see that. And what we are talking about now is another increase in that trend. And we\u2019re talking about very, very recent accident periods, and looking at the data and responding, I think pretty quickly.", "And so I think there is a bunch of things. Further on the comment of, you\u2019re sure it\u2019s not Quantum 2. We\u2019re sure it\u2019s not exclusively Quantum 2, because when we look across our business the same fundamental trends are in the legacy book of business, are in the Quantum 1 book of business, are in the Quantum 2 book of business, are in the business insurance business. It\u2019s in industry data. It\u2019s without the carriers. So it\u2019s not exclusively a Quantum issue. With that said, we are very granularly looking at how that product is performing, state-by-state sell-by-sell and reacting. So, I know that, and that\u2019s this probably sounding way more defensive than I should, but it\u2026", "Alan Schnitzer", "The one thing I would add to that, Larry its Alan. The profile of the business that we\u2019re attracting, we actually like it. We look at the profile of all the business coming in, and if we didn\u2019t like that profile, we would have the defending answers for you. But fundamentally, we like it. We just like it at a higher base rate.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please proceed with your question.", "Meyer Shields", "One, I guess, question on the actual quarter. There was a slowdown in exposure unit growth within the middle market. I was hoping you could talk to that a little bit?", "Brian MacLean", "There is nothing fundamental in terms of trends changing there. There is always going to be some normal volatility from quarter-to-quarter and things that drive the exposure. But there is really nothing fundamental that we would identify as a trend.", "Meyer Shields", "So not related to the improving renewal rate changes?", "Brian MacLean", "No.", "Meyer Shields", "And then more broadly speaking, when you look at the targeted after tax returns, would a change in tax rate change what you\u2019re targeting?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s an interesting question. And I guess instead of answering that specific question, let me just back-up because my guess is there is a lot of questions on the call in terms of change administration, macro environment, how it\u2019s going to change, a lot of different things. And so maybe I\u2019ll just back-up. We are very return focused in the way we think about this business. It is the lens which we evaluate just about every decision that we make. And so, we calibrate our return expectation to our cost of capital.", "And so there are couples of things going on that could impact cost and capital. For example, if the risk free rate goes up, cost of equity goes up. If the tax rate goes down then our after-tax cost of borrowing theoretically goes up. There could be other things in a change in tax policy. But if you just started with those two simple assumptions, you would look at that and say, gee, if the risk free rate goes up and if the tax rate goes down, you would speculate that our overall cost of capital would go up. If our overall cost of capital went up then our return objectives would go up with it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Meredith", "Couple of questions here, just first on the personal lines, do you think that the rate actions you are taking on auto insurance will have an impact on homeowners growth here going forward?", "Michael Klein", "I think that's possible. We've certainly talked about the fact that our auto growth has -- one of the benefits of our auto growth has been growth in home. That said, we\u2019re doing what we can to mitigate that impact. And we've got specific actions we're taken from an agency management and a distribution standpoint and in another areas to try to make sure that any impacts from the rate actions in auto don\u2019t have any impact on our ability to grow home. We\u2019re trying to continue the momentum that we have in the home line into 2017.", "Alan Schnitzer", "In other words, they definitely co-relate. But we think -- we\u2019re hopeful there are things we can do to offset that and try to lever up the home growth.", "Brian Meredith", "And then the second question here. On the domestic business insurance, we've seen your rate activity modestly increase the last several quarters. Is that a trend we should continue? And are you getting to a point now where you\u2019re saying all right, can't let the underlying loss ratio deteriorate anymore on an underwriting year basis?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I know this won't be totally satisfying, but I think we need to go back to the answer we gave, which is we look at the accounts that are up for renewal every quarter and we try to figure out what we need to do to achieve our written objectives. And it's every single one of those transactions, or every portfolio on the flow stuff, really evaluated one at the time that rises up to that number. So, we don\u2019t think with a broad brush. We don\u2019t go out to the market and say get 1.4 points of rate in middle market. We say this is our overall return objective, and go out and execute one account or class at a time to get there. And we will when we get to the 10-K give you an outlook on RPC. So we haven\u2019t showed that yet, it will be in the 10-K when it comes out. But we never forecast on uniquely on peer rates.", "Brian Meredith", "But you are forecasting for a flat underlying combined ratio for the next year. And then if I remember correctly that was part of it. But yes, there is going to be better non-cap with at least normalization and then deterioration from rate below trend, right?", "Alan Schnitzer", "So the margin compression that we've had this quarter and the last few quarters has been relatively modest. And this quarter and in past quarters, it's been within other things that cause volatility in the period-over-period comparison. Most notably, this quarter and probably recent quarters weather and large losses. So, when we give you that outlook and yes we did say broadly consistent, we're certainly not measuring to the basis points, but probably consistent within a relatively narrow range. That takes into account lots of things rate, loss trend, mix, claims handling initiatives, other strategic objectives. So it really is an all-in assessment and we try not to focus too narrowly on that narrow rate loss trend. You\u2019ve got exposure in there too, contributing to margin. So, it really is a [technical difficulty] when it comes to our outlook on margin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Cohen", "One more question, I guess, about the new administration. Obviously, something that\u2019s being talked about relative to taxes is a board or adjustment tax. I\u2019m wondering if you could share your thoughts on how that may affect your purchase of reinsurance from non-U.S. companies.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, good mornings, it\u2019s Alan let me start. It\u2019s really hard to answer that question without knowing what the board or adjustments going to look like. And we\u2019ve all read it depends on whether it\u2019s characterized as an export or an import and whether the dialogs or defaults to the new bill, and we\u2019ll see where that comes out. I think broadly speaking, as it relates to us in reinsurance, I think, our answer would be, we\u2019re by enlarge a gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting. We like to keep it. And we buy reinsurance in pretty modest amounts. And so, if there were tax adjustments that change the cost of reinsurance, obviously, we could look for alternative providers of reinsurance. We could buy a little bit less, buy a little bit more. But it would come down to evaluating the individual transaction. But I think the broader point for us is reinsurance is just isn\u2019t that big deal for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Macquarie. Please proceed with your question.", "Amit Kumar", "Two quick follow up on personal auto, the first question I have is. If I go back and look at the rates that were put in place for 2016, I guess, average rate filling for in the range of, let's say 3% or so. So, when you talk about the rate filings in November, December and going forward, how should we think about that number compared to the historical 3% average number?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would say it\u2019s a pretty broad range. It depends on the state, and even there, it depends on two things; one, our experience in that state; and the rate need, but also recent rate fillings in that state right, because there is a cumulative nature to it. But certainly, it\u2019s getting bigger than what you\u2019d seen earlier in 2016. And we expect more the same during 2017 to try to close that gap of 3.5 points.", "Amit Kumar", "Okay, so probably more than that. Is that a fair way to look at it?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, definitely.", "Amit Kumar", "The second question and the final question I have is, you talked about 60% of your book, 16 states. You said more filings for in the pipeline. Is that immediate? Is that like a Jan-Feb thing, or is that more spread out versus the actions taken in the past?", "Michael Klein ", "Amit, this is Michael. I would just to clarify the comment. So the comment was 60% of our quote volume. So, again think of that as that\u2019s a new business statistics, right. So, the 16 states that we filed-in so far, those represent roughly 60% of our new business quote volumes; not exactly the same as 60% of the book, just a point of clarification. I would say the majority of the rest of the states have rate filings plan for the first quarter. And so broadly speaking, we will have made rate filings in the majority of the states where we have the auto product by the end of the first quarter. We also have additional rate actions planned for later in the year. And that obviously is all subject to regulatory approval and regulatory constraints to the timing and the amount. But I would say the first round ought to be in market by late in the first quarter, and then we've got follow-up actions on the drawing board as we look into the remainder of 2017.", "Amit Kumar", "I think that's very helpful. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.", "Ryan Tunis", "My first question, I guess, just for Brain, and it's on the new business penalty. It doesn\u2019t sound like the thinking has really changed on the impact to the new business penalty. I guess, even though the environments revealed it-self to be a bit more of an issue maybe than we thought a couple of quarters ago. Just what gives you confidence, I guess, to continue to compartmentalize the BI severity versus the new business drag, especially when you think about the fact that a pretty good size of the book is new business? And I guess along those lines, if there so is a big 10 year impact, why wouldn\u2019t we assume that a lot of that strain alleviate itself in 2017 with the growth pull-back?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, so a couple of things. So I think of the 10 year impact as being discreet from the bodily injury trend. And so the 10 year impact is just the math of the maturing of the book of business. And in fact where it goes in 2017 is a function somewhat of what growth rates do. It will likely increase in 2017 slightly, as the growth that we've seen in the back half of 2016 earns through the business. But I think of the 10 year impact is more of just the arithmetic of. I don\u2019t think of it is a new business penalty as in a BI where you\u2019re pricing differently.", "Michael Klein", "Yes, I think, and again I think it's, this is Michael. I would say just to reinforce what Brain said. When we talk about the 10 year effect, what we\u2019re really trying to do is just isolate the impact on the loss ratio from the relative age of the business, if you will, right. How tenured it is? What renewal it is at? And as Brain said, it's essentially a mathematical exercise that estimate what that component is or was. And then the rest of it, the environmental turn that we talked about the 3.5 points that's in the full year loss ratio, is absolutely the gap that we\u2019re actively working to close. What we do in the meantime is we monitor the performance of the tenuring and try to isolate that, and make sure that that is developing as we expected. And that analysis has remained relatively consistent, and is why we continue to have that same 2% estimate a quarter later.", "Ryan Tunis", "And then a couple of quick ones for Jay Benet, first on the workers comps and general liability, just curious the accident years and those reserve releases. And also just getting color on how new money yields have changed, I guess, today versus the end of the third quarter? Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "As it relates to the accident year question, it's really spread amongst a number of accident years. We, in the past in our disclosures have said, at times, it's related to accident years X and Y. And when we\u2019re preparing disclosures this time, the laundry list of accident years was exceptionally long and we just said why don\u2019t we just say what it relates to. So, there isn\u2019t any particular accident year for either one of them, it's just spread amongst various ones.", "As it relates to the new money yields, just looking up some stats as it relate, let\u2019s say -- we generally tend to focus on the ten year treasury. So, if you look at where the 10 year treasury was at the end of September, it was 1.6 and ended December 2.45. And spreads moved in that time frame as well. So I think you could look at the public data as so what to place, but a considerable rise in interest rates from one period to the next. Bill, do you want to add something?", "Brian MacLean", "I thought I might add a little. Obviously, the question goes to at what point will new money yields exceed maturing yields. And obviously, the actions before this quarter gets us close to that point. But we\u2019re not yet where we need to be. We\u2019ve done a fair amount of work on it in the last few weeks, and using a whole bunch of assumptions, which would take long times really. We think that where taxable is being replaced by taxables, we reached that point sometime in the first half of 2017; for municipals replacing municipals closer to the first half of 2019.", "Obviously, a lot is going to be determined by the shape of any tax legislation as a very extreme, if you needed, a revenue neutral bill and the municipal exemption itself were affected, that would be non-trivial. If corporate rates were simple, and individual rates were simply lowered and the relative value of municipal were affected then they\u2019ve already achieved it. That would be less important to us. But in the bottom line is where is, what I think you\u2019re getting at, we\u2019re not quite there yet.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thanks guys.", "Jay Benet", "And this is Jay Benet, again. If I could just add one thing, not relating to your questions but during my remarks one of my collogues tap me on the shoulder, indicating that instead of referring back to November\u2019s filling of Form 8-K, I inadvertently said 10-K. So, we don\u2019t file a 10-K in November. We did file an 8-K about the settlement. So, I just wanted to correct the record. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Elyse Greenspan", "One question first on the personal auto book, as you pointed to your margin outlook for 2017. Can you talk about, I guess, the components of the expense ratio and the underlying loss ratio? The expense ratio do tick down in the Q4, so it\u2019s part of helping to get to your margin goal for next year on some kind of improvement in the expense ratio to offset potentially your continued deterioration on the loss side. Can you just take us through the components a little bit?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Elyse, good morning it\u2019s Alan. I would say that we go about as far as we want to go and getting outlook. And we\u2019re pretty hesitant to start breaking it down to the component pieces. Part of our strategy, at least on the auto side, was obviously reducing expenses. And you\u2019ve seen that come through to some extent already. But going forward, we prefer not to break out the pieces.", "Elyse Greenspan", "And then one other question, the business insurance reserve releases picked up materially year-over-year, as well as sequentially. I know you reference it spanned numerous accident years and workers comp with GL lines. As we think about potentially an environment where we\u2019ll see higher inflation levels going forward, just wondering if you could provide some commentary surrounding the pics that you\u2019re using on some of your longer tail lines? And what give you confidence for such a high level reserve releases given the uncertainties surrounding forward inflation levels? Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, as it relates to reserving, as well as pricing and loss mix, so particularly year. We\u2019re not assuming in any of the work we do this year or in any previous years that whatever the inflation environment that currently exists. And I have to say, it's an inflation environment related to the specific drivers of losses in our product as opposed to the general level of inflation. But we never assume that things are going to stay stagnant. There is an underlying assumption that things will overtime reverts back to the mean. And as you can well imagine, there is a great deal of actuarial judgment, management judgment, as to what that means.", "So - and looking at the reserves as they exist today, looking at how the development patterns have manifested themselves in the lost triangles, we come up with what our best estimate is of the future payments that we will be making. And if those best estimates are lower than what the carried reserves are, we\u2019ll make adjustments for it. But it is factoring in a long-term view as to what the levels of inflation might be.", "Operator", "And that's from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Gelb", "I had a question on your asbestos exposure. Earlier this month, the Hartford announced an economically favorable transaction, Berkshire Hathaway, to buy retroactive reinsurance contract. The size of Hartford's exposure is very similar to Travelers\u2019, at $1.8 billion for asbestos environmental. And there's been $300 million annual pretax drag on Travelers\u2019 earnings for the past two years. I'm wondering what your thoughts are now that other companies are taking steps to address these legacy exposures?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, thanks for asking, Jay. There's nothing fundamentally novel about those transactions. And as you can imagine, we look at them from time-to-time. So far, we haven't seen terms on one of those deals that we found attractive enough to do. And I'm not sure what else to say about it.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Thank you very much for joining us today. Have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation.

Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that are available in the Investors section on our website.", "And now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported second quarter net income of $595 million and return on equity of 10%. Core income was $543 million and core return on equity was 9.5%. Our results this quarter were impacted by $262 million of after-tax catastrophe losses as well as significant non-cat weather losses, particularly in personal insurance. This has been an active weather year, with first half after-tax catastrophe losses of $488 million or 6 points on the combined ratio.", "To put that in some context, this was our highest level of first half catastrophe losses since 2011. While relatively high, the level of weather losses this quarter and year are within an over time range that we plan and price for. And we are confident that we are appropriately managing our exposures. Putting aside the weather, we were very pleased with the underwriting results in our commercial businesses and the progress we have made in personal insurance. In business insurance, we improved our underlying combined ratio compared to the prior year quarter. We were able to maintain a flat underlying loss ratio year-over-year in part by managing the non-rate levers that we talked to you about from time-to-time. Things like risk selection, mix, segmentation, risk control and claims handling. We also improved our expense ratio by about half a point.", "Our Bond & Specialty business delivered another quarter of excellent results with a combined ratio of 68.7%. In personal insurance, the underwriting results in both auto and home for the quarter were significantly impacted by catastrophe and non-cat weather losses. Within personal auto, bodily injury loss trends remained consistent with our expectations and we are on track with the actions we have taken to improve profitability. In terms of our investment results for the quarter, after-tax net investment income increased 6% over the prior year quarter benefiting from strong private equity returns. Our results enabled us to return $676 million to shareholders in the quarter, including $475 million in share repurchases.", "Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 5% net written premium growth to a record $6.64 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continued to be successful in achieving historically high retention levels while also delivering positive and in some cases somewhat higher renewal rate change from recent quarters. In our core middle-market business, we achieved positive renewal rate change on an increasing portion of our portfolio. From a little more than half our accounts in the first quarter of last year to almost 60% in the first quarter of this year to just over 60% in the current quarter. And we did so while simultaneously maintaining retention at a very high 88%.", "As you have heard us say many times, our production is a result of deliberate account by account and class by class execution. Our efforts this quarter and over recent quarters reflect the continued low interest rate environment and the fact that rate together with the component of exposure that has the same impact on margins as rates have been below loss trend for a few years now. We will continue to execute to meet our return objectives, including by managing the non-rate letters and by seeking rate increases selectively and thoughtfully.", "In Personal Insurance, we continue to improve the profitability in our auto business by implementing the pricing and underwriting actions that we have discussed with you over the last few quarters. We are on track to achieve double-digit renewal premium change on a written basis for the end of the third quarter and loss trend remains consistent with our expectations. Given that progress and the continued growth in our very profitable Homeowners business, we feel good about the trajectory of our personal lines business.", "Looking forward across all our businesses, we are engaged strategically to maintain and strengthen our competitive advantages. We are focused on our digital agenda on advancing the way we leverage data on exploring and piloting smart investments and things like AI and robotics on setting the standard in terms of the experience for our customers and distribution partners and as always on being as productive and efficient as possible. So as much as we are relentlessly committed to day-to-day execution we are just as committed to our long-term strategic position. And speaking of our digital agenda, we couldn\u2019t be more excited to welcome Simply Business under the Travelers\u2019 umbrella in the third quarter.", "To sum it up, I am pleased and encouraged by execution in the first half of the year. And with our franchise value, strong balance sheet, superior talent and capital management strategy, we remain well-positioned to continue to deliver industry leading results. And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. Core income was $543 million down from $649 million in the prior year quarter. And core ROE was 9.5%, down from 11.6%. As was the case in the first quarter, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our performance rather they were reflective of lower net favorable prior year reserve development and another quarter of relatively high levels of cat and non-cat weather activity.", "Beginning with underwriting results, net favorable prior year reserve development, which I will discuss in more detail shortly, was $132 million after-tax or $60 million less than the prior year quarter. This decrease was almost entirely in bond and specialty, where net favorable development decreased from a very high amount in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $262 million after-tax, $40 million higher than the already high $222 million in the prior year quarter. And while remaining strong as evidenced by our 93.5% underlying combined ratio, underlying underwriting gain was lower than the prior year quarter primarily due to two things.", "As we had anticipated, the timing impact of personal auto bodily injury loss estimates that were consistent with the higher loss trends that we recognized in the second half of 2016 and normal quarterly fluctuations in non-cat weather. Investment results were once again strong, net investment income of $468 million after-tax, increased by 6% or $26 million as compared to the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income, NII increased by $46 million after-tax due to strong private equity returns, which more than offset the fully anticipated $20 million after-tax decrease in fixed income NII driven by the continued low interest rate environment. Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $203 million pre-tax compared to $288 million in the prior year quarter.", "Business Insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $125 million pre-tax, the same as in the prior year quarter and net of the $65 million pre-tax or $42 million after-tax increase to environmental reserves. BI\u2019s favorable development was driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic businesses for workers\u2019 comp, CMP liability, NGL. Bond & Specialty\u2019s net favorable development was $78 million pre-tax, down from a very high $159 million in the prior year quarter, driven by better than expected loss experience in our domestic management liability business and it was known that prior year reserve development in PI this quarter. On a combined statutory Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate and all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate develop favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development in the first half of the year.", "Operating cash flows of $810 million remain very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of $2.6 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year and higher than what we considered to be normal. This $900 million increase driven mostly by the $700 million, up 4% 30-year senior notes that we issued on May 30 allows for the funding of our acquisition of Simply Business expected to close in the third quarter as well as the repayment of our $450 million of senior notes maturing in December. All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels.", "Net unrealized investment gains were approximately $1.6 billion pre-tax or $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.46 and adjusted book value per share of $82.71 increased 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year. We continue to generate much more capital than we need to support our businesses allowing us to return $676 million of excess capital to our shareholders this quarter. We paid dividends of $201 million and repurchased $475 million of our common shares consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy. And year-to-date we returned $1.15 billion to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Before turning the mic over to Brian, there is one additional topic I will cover. On Page 19 of the webcast, you can see an update of our cat reinsurance treaties that renewed on July 1. There were no significant changes to these treaties and their cost was modestly lower than last year. As for our one remaining cat bond, which runs through May 2018 it\u2019s attachment point maximum limit were reset as required annually to adjust the modeled expected loss of the layer within a predetermined range. For the year beginning May 16, 2017, we will begin recovering amounts under this cat bond if losses in the covered area for single occurrence reach an initial attachment point of $2.346 billion, up from the previous attachment point of $1.968 billion. The full $300 million of coverage amount is available on a proportional basis until such covered losses reach a maximum of $2.846 billion.", "With that, I will turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in Business Insurance, we are pleased with segment income of $429 million and a combined ratio of 96.5%. The underlying combined ratio was 94.8%, down 0.5 point compared to the second quarter of 2016, driven by a lower expense ratio. The decline in the expense ratio resulted from slightly lower expense dollars and growing earned premium.", "Turning to the underlying loss ratio, as Alan mentioned earlier, our active management of the non-rate levers along with favorable non-cat weather in Business Insurance contributed to a comparable loss ratio year-over-year. We were especially pleased that we were able to achieve this result in an environment of relatively modest price increases. Net written premiums of $3.5 billion for the quarter were up more than 2% year-over-year, with domestic net written premiums, up about 2% driven by strong production results in select and middle-market. International net written premiums were up 8%, driven by the timing of certain adjustments in the second quarter of 2016.", "Turning to domestic production, one of our critical objectives is to retain our high-quality book of business. And accordingly, we were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was 3.5 points in the quarter, up about 1 point from the first quarter due to exposure growth in all lines, most notably in our property lines. Rate change remained consistent with last quarter and up more than 0.5 point from a year ago. We continue to achieve rate gains selectively and thoughtfully and are pleased that improvement in rate from a year ago has come broadly across the portfolio. New business of $491 million was consistent with the prior year quarter.", "Looking at the individual businesses, I will begin with Select, where production statistics remain strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%. Renewal premium change was about 5 points while new business premiums of $109 million were up 10% year-over-year. In middle-market, our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 88%. Renewal premium change of about 3.5 points was up about a point from the first quarter due primarily to increased exposure across all lines and included nearly a point of renewal rate change, up a bit from the first quarter. New business of $294 million was down slightly versus the prior year quarter. So, all-in a good financial result for the segment with continued stability in the marketplace.", "I will now turn to Bond & Specialty Insurance, where segment income for the quarter was strong at $163 million. Income was down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio remained very strong 82%. As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 5% across the segment, with solid growth in our domestic surety and management liability businesses. In international, growth was driven by strong production in our Canadian Surety and UK Management Liability businesses, along with some non-recurring policy and reinsurance timing.", "Turning to production in our domestic management liability business, we continue to execute our strategy of retaining our best performing accounts, while writing new business in return adequate product segments. So, we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that for the third consecutive quarter, retention came in at a historic high of 88%, while new business was up slightly from the second quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.8 points was down slightly from the first quarter. So, Bond & Specialty results remained terrific and we continue to feel great about the segment\u2019s performance and our market positions.", "Turning to Personal Insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter, with roughly half of that growth coming from price increases. The quarter\u2019s combined ratio of 104.1 was significantly impacted by weather, with catastrophe losses of nearly 10 points for the second consecutive quarter. The underlying combined ratio of 94.5 was also significantly impacted by weather, with non-catastrophe loss levels that were well above what we would normally expect in the second quarter.", "Turning to auto, in terms of production, we are pleased that we were successful in maintaining strong retention, while achieving significant price increases. New business was down slightly year-over-year, while TIF growth moderated. The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106.4 with 4 points of cat losses more than double our normal second quarter expectation. The auto underlying combined ratio of 102.4 was also impacted by weather, with about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which was above our expectations, but about the same as the second quarter of 2016.", "Excluding the impact of weather, auto loss results remained in line with our expectations. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio was up 3.8 points. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, the increase is primarily due to the timing of the impact of the higher run-rate of bodily injury losses that we recognized in the second half of 2016. As we discussed in our year end results call, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book.", "Renewal premium change increased from about 6% in the first quarter to nearly 8% in the second quarter and we remain on track to reach double-digit increases before the end of the third quarter. By year end, we expect to have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels. The full earned impact of these written rate increases will be realized by the end of 2018 consistent with the timeframe we mentioned in January. As we have discussed in recent quarters, the combined ratio also continues to be elevated due to the impact of tenure on our book as the higher levels of new business written in previous periods continue to season. We expect this impact will continue to grow for a few more quarters albeit at a decreasing rate. As new business production moderates to a steady state, the tenure impact will gradually diminish. The gradual reduction of the tenure impact, along with rate that keeps pace with loss trend over time, should result in a combined ratio that aligns with our target. It\u2019s important to note that even though the combined ratio is currently elevated due to the impact of tenure, we expect the new business to add economic value on a lifetime basis as the increased volume brings additional profit dollars.", "Turning to Agency Homeowners and Other, the combined ratio of 100.3 for the second quarter reflects 17.5 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 82.8 was 4.6 points higher than the second quarter of 2016. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to non-cat weather losses, which were also significantly higher than our long-term average. Continuing the momentum in recent quarters, Homeowners\u2019 net written premiums and policies in-force both grew at levels consistent with the strong results we experienced in the first quarter. We were pleased that we achieved modest price increases in this profitable line, added more property-oriented distribution partners, and focused on account rounding. So clearly, a significant impact from weather in the quarter, but we continued to grow our profitable Homeowners business and made good progress towards the goals we laid out for auto at the end of last year.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Kelly, we are ready to begin the Q&A portion of the call. Before we begin, I would ask you to limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you and good morning. My first question on Personal Insurance, could you quantify the impact from the non-cat weather as well as a tenure in the second quarter results?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. So, I will start with that. This is Brian. And let me do them in reverse order. On the tenure impact, we said last quarter or the quarter before that it was about 2 points and that\u2019s up about 1 point. So right now, it\u2019s about 3 points in total in the combined ratio and that\u2019s about 1 point delta from last year. On the non-cat weather of the 4.6 points you know variance in the underlying, the vast majority of it and you can think roundly about three quarters of that number is due to non-cat weather. And the reason for the lack of total precision there is that we are looking at a lot of loss activity in trying to attribute it and we were pretty accurate on it, but it\u2019s not something that you can specifically tie down and Michael has got a little bit more detail.", "Michael Klein", "Yes. I think so again, the 4.6 Brian is referring to as property year-over-year variance. And as you said, the majority of that is due to non-cat weather. I would say a couple of things on that front. One, from our perspective and I think you can look at weather data and see that it was a very active first half of the year from a weather standpoint. NOAA talked about nearly 11,000 severe weather events through May of this year being up over long-term averages. And I think importantly to back it up to what non-cat weather is right. So, our non-cat weather according to our definition does include some PCS events that don\u2019t meet our catastrophe threshold, but it also includes a variety of much smaller weather events that never make the news. And connecting that to the NOAA data one of the things that they talked about is through May, there were over 6,000 reports of wind damage, which is either wind damage or storms that have significant wind associated with them. Again, not the things that show up on the news, but according to their statistics, those events that 6,000 is almost double the average of the 2000 to 2016 run-rate. And it\u2019s the second highest amount of storms of that type since 2011. So, I think our experience is consistent with that, the drivers underneath that non-cat weather. The biggest incurred loss increases we see underneath that estimate are associated with wind and hail.", "Kai Pan", "Great.", "Alan Schnitzer", "So, that\u2019s a little bit more color on what\u2019s underneath that from a property.", "Brian MacLean", "Right. So this is Brian. So, that was a very good long answer to the question you didn\u2019t ask. I apologize for hearing that incorrectly. But on the auto side, there is 1.5 points as I said in the underlying, about 1.5 points of non-cat weather losses, which comparable to what we had in last year\u2019s results and I would say a good bit higher than what we \u2013 what our normal expectations would be, what our long-term averages are. So, hopefully that\u2019s responsive.", "Kai Pan", "I really appreciate the extensive response. My follow-up questions on expense ratio side, you have seen quite a bit of improvements in Personal Auto, will that continue? And then were you expanding any of these initiatives into the Business Insurance on the expense side, because we have seen some year-over-year improvement there as well? Are there more to come?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes. So, let\u2019s take the two pieces. Michael can talk a little bit. Expenses we have done \u2013 we have been doing a lot in Personal Insurance for the last couple of years and that is continuing and then we could talk a little bit about Business Insurance and what we are doing there. So, Michael on the PI\u2026", "Michael Klein", "Yes, from a Personal Insurance standpoint, the story continues to be that we are adding volume and holding costs pretty consistent. So, I mean that\u2019s a continuation of the story we have been talking about and we continue to see some of that benefit in the quarter.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Hey, Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Let me try to address your question on Business Insurance. So, we don\u2019t give outlook explicitly on expenses and there is always from period-to-period going to be some ups and downs in expenses. But we have had a number of initiatives underway. We have got initiatives underway now. If you looked at our shop floor right now, we\u2019d say that there is improved productivity. It\u2019s \u2013 you don\u2019t exactly see that coming through in the numbers in the moment, because for example there is other ups and downs and we have got the expenses associated, the cost associated with creating that productivity, but it is a serious and ongoing initiative that we are all hopeful that we will be seeing in incoming periods.", "Kai Pan", "Great. Well, thanks so much for all the answers.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi, yes. My first question is on just in going through some of your commentary in the queue in terms of the outlook for the Business Insurance business for 2018 you point to stable renewal price changes and also stable margins. I guess just how are you expecting your margins to stay stable when even if we get continued exposure growth, your rate is falling below trend, if you could just provide some additional commentary and how you see kind of your margins in that business playing out in 2018?", "AlanSchnitzer", "Yes, good morning, Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. We do get that from time-to-time. And I think we have addressed that on this call from time-to-time. We get the math here looking at it\u2019s a very certain narrow rate versus loss trend. But what we have told you and what I tried to address in my prepared remarks this morning is that there are plenty of levers other than just pure rate that contribute to the margin outlook. And I mentioned some of it in my prepared remarks, things like segmentation and risk selection and claims handling and risk control expenses, all the rest. So, all of those things wrap up in margin. The component of margin that is sort of narrow rate versus loss trend, particularly when you take into account the component of exposure that behaves like rate from a margin perspective is and continues to be relatively small. And these incremental rate gains that we have been writing for a few quarters now have offset that to some degree. So, you take all that together and we are comfortable with a broadly consistent outlook. Of course there is going to be volatility from things like weather, but in terms of things we control we feel good about a broadly consistent margin outlook, we have been giving you that outlook for some quarters now and we have delivered on it. So, we feel good about it.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then just a couple of quick things on that Personal Auto side, the new business did decline this quarter, policy count still do go up sequentially. How do you see the policy count playing out as you continue to push for more rate? And a second question in the commentary you guys pointed to what you are doing to get back to your target margin in that business. Could you just remind us what your target margin is for the Personal Auto business? Thank you.", "Michael Klein", "Sure. And Elyse, this is Michael. I will start with the target margin question. I think broadly a combined ratio range of 96 to 98 points for auto is the range that we are shooting for over time. To your question on TIF and PIF growth, as we have talked about, our strategy is to improve profitability in auto, while growth moderates. We are very pleased with the trajectory that the TIF growth in the new business is on. We are also, I\u2019ll say particularly pleased with the strength of retention in the face of the increased rate. You see retention in the production slide at 85 points, actually above our long run average for that number, a number we are very pleased with as we have moved rate up almost a couple of points quarter-on-quarter. In terms of the outlook for PIF growth again our plan remains consistent. We are looking for moderate growth, while we continue to improve profitability.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And Elyse, it\u2019s Alan. I would just add on the margin target. There is some advantage we have to being an account solution, the fact that we have such a good Homeowners\u2019 book enables us to \u2013 gives us some advantage in the combined ratio target for the auto and not from a subsidization perspective, but from a synergy perspective, for example, the impact on retention and things like that. So, we think the fact that we are an account solution provider is a big help from that perspective.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks and good morning. With regard to the small commercial business market, Travelers is clearly a leader in that space. We have seen a number of other large companies looking to either enter that business or more insured tech focused operations trying to disrupt that business. Can you talk about how Travelers is defending its position in that profitable market?", "AlanSchnitzer", "Yes, good morning Jay, it\u2019s Alan. So, yes, we read the same retrofit you read to one degree or another, occasionally we see it in the marketplace, I think different competitors and others are at different stages of their engagement in the marketplace. And just a couple of things, one, we do have \u2013 start with a great position, we think that\u2019s important from a competitive perspective. We have got great technology. We have got great talent. We have got great data. We have got great relationships with distribution. We think all that\u2019s \u2013 all that\u2019s very important. And we are not standing still. So, some of the investments I mentioned in my prepared remarks are directly related to those businesses. That\u2019s important for us. And you look at investments like Simply Business that is meant to make sure that as we look around the landscape and see how the world is changing that we are positioning Travelers to continue to be effective and very competitive in that marketplace. And lastly, I would have that small commercial, in fact all of our businesses have always been competitive and we have got lots of arrows in the quiver that I guess I should say competitive advantages that enable us to compete effectively. So, we feel good about the outlook.", "Jay Gelb", "As competition increases in that space and it moves more towards technology focused, I mean, we see a number of these companies saying essentially one or two clicks and you get the quote to bind. Is Travelers where it needs to be from that perspective?", "AlanSchnitzer", "Yes. There is a lot of rhetoric out there. How much business is actually being transacted on that basis and how much is aspirational from the perspective whether that you are saying is something that is worth looking into. But I would say that we are as engaged as anybody on \u2013 in all those areas and as aspirational as everybody in all those areas. So, yes, we think we are where we need to be to make sure that we continue to be competitive. And again, just think about the innovation going on around here are the investments that we are making and we are not flat-footed. These aren\u2019t things that we are starting with today, these things that we in many, many cases have been thinking about for many years. And again I will just point to the Simply Business transaction. That\u2019s something that we announced a couple of quarters ago, but it\u2019s nothing we stumbled on a couple of quarters ago. That was the result of having been thinking about the exact issue you are talking about over a number of years and planning and being thoughtful and strategic about it. So I would say yes, we are where we need to be.", "Jay Gelb", "Appreciate it. Thank you.", "AlanSchnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.", "Jay Cohen", "Yes. Just one follow-up, maybe two follow-ups on the personal line side, one is that PIF growth in the Homeowners business seems pretty resilient in the face of rising auto insurance premium rates. Would you expect to maintain that or could your effort to improve auto have some spillover effect on the Homeowners side?", "Michael Klein", "Jay, this is Michael. I think that\u2019s something that we have been talking about and focusing on and it is why in addition to our objective to improve profits and moderate growth in auto. Our other key objective is to maintain the momentum in homes. To Brian\u2019s prepared remarks, we have made some specific efforts to sustain that home growth in the face of seeking the auto rate, focusing more on rounded business. The good news underneath both the auto and the home growth is the strongest growth we see it in rounded accounts where we are writing both the auto and the home or writing the auto or the home with other lines of business. We are focusing on property intensive distribution relationships, focusing on distribution management and working with agents and brokers to make sure they are giving us at least our fair share of the property business that goes with the auto we write. So, I think through a series of specific tactics and strategies that\u2019s what helped us sustain the home growth so far and we are hopeful that we can continue that.", "Jay Cohen", "That\u2019s good answer. Thank you. The other just quick one on the auto side, if you look at second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter that did get a bit worth, I am assuming some of that\u2019s non-cat weather and I am assuming some of that is seasonality. Is that a fair assessment?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, tell us again what number you are looking at. Just so I want to make sure that we are looking the right thing.", "Jay Cohen", "Yes. I am looking at personal auto second quarter underlying loss ratio versus first quarter underlying loss ratio first quarter 2017, so consecutive quarter?", "Alan Schnitzer", "As you can see in the webcast, the lion\u2019s share of that is the timing of the recognition of the bodily injury losses and then there is the 10-year component that Brian mentioned.", "Jay Benet", "But if you are comparing Q2 this year to Q1 this year, Jay?", "Jay Cohen", "The timing shouldn\u2019t be an issue.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, I am sorry, I was thinking you were talking\u2026.", "Jay Benet", "Right. So, I think to your point, there is seasonality in that expectation is the key driver of that. Again, when we look at underlying consistent with the comments that Brian made, you do have non-cat weather impacting that. We have a higher loss ratio expectation in the second quarter than we do in the first largely related to weather and driving activity picking up.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Helpful. Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please proceed with your question.", "Meyer Shields", "Great. Thanks. Brian, you mentioned when you are discussing to this insurance that there was lower non-cat weather in the quarter, is that just sort of randomness or is there some reason why you would see a divergence in non-cat weather losses between business and personal insurance?", "Brian MacLean", "Yes, I think it\u2019s mostly randomness. And when you think of what\u2019s driving the non-cat weather as Michael said, it\u2019s not the big, big catastrophe events, the smaller events are the ones that don\u2019t even make PCS events. And those things are more likely to have a frequency on the Homeowners side than they would on the business insurance side. So, it\u2019s probably mostly randomness and then some the nature of the beast.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes. So, Meyer, you think about hail for example and the types of things that individuals ensure are more susceptible to hail damage, for example, than commercial property that\u2019s more resilient.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay, that makes sense. The second issue when we look at the pricing changes in business insurance that are hovering around 60 basis points, which is appreciably different than the preceding four quarters. I am saying appreciably, so less than a point. Does that translate into sort of different expectations for core underwriting margins? Is it a little easier as that 60 basis points runs in?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Sure. I mean, it\u2019s just math right. As the pure rate goes up and by the way I would point out that the exposure is up 2, we are not calling that a trend, but it\u2019s broadly enough across our portfolio that for the most part we are attributing it to economic activity. But you look at that incremental price and you look at the component of exposure that behaves like rates and sure, it\u2019s math that it\u2019s a good guy from a margin perspective for sure. It\u2019s not \u2013 we are not at the point where they are equal to each other, but we are getting closer.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi, good morning. First, just on the personal auto insurance combined ratio target of 96% to 98%, does that include the tenure impact and what I am trying to get at is when you say you get back to your target margins by the end of \u201818 should we be thinking 96% to 98% plus a couple of points for tenure?", "Michael Klein", "So, Sarah to your point, let me just make sure I say this accurately. So when we say at the end of \u201818 we are not talking about the tenure. So, it is 96% to 98% plus a tenure impact. So I think it\u2019s the way you just said it. And\u2026", "Alan Schnitzer", "And specifically your comment about the end of \u201818 is rates covering the increased bodily injury loss estimate.", "Michael Klein", "Right, right. And so I think as you put those things together it answers I think the other way you asked that which is when we say 96% to 98% we are assuming that tenure has moderated and we are at kind of a steady state.", "Jay Benet", "But I will go back just to highlight Brian included in his prepared remarks which is we don\u2019t look as tenure as a bad guy, because it\u2019s part of the plan. It\u2019s adding economic value. And so that\u2019s deliberate.", "Sarah DeWitt", "But would it be zero by the end of \u201818 right?", "Jay Benet", "No, no, no. I think Michael said this in the last quarter comments I just repeat it is that when we talk about the timing of tenure unwinding what we are talking in terms of years, not quarters.", "Sarah DeWitt", "And then my follow-up is just could you revisit again what you are seeing in terms of lot trends this quarter. Are they consistent? Are there any signs of it picking up or moderating and if you could talk about commercial versus personal? That would be helpful.", "Michael Klein", "Yes. I will take that Sarah in our personal business, loss trend came in as we expected. So \u2013 and I think we have told in the past where expectations were, but there is nothing happened this quarter or first half of the year that was inconsistent with our expectations. And I would make the same comment about business insurance it\u2019s very stable and inconsistent with our expectations. Now, I am addressing in a sentence frequency and severity over $15 billion of business. So, there is always going to be ups and downs in one line versus another, but broadly speaking, we view loss trend in our commercial businesses as I am nothing remarkable consistent with expectations.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please proceed with your question.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes, thanks. Two questions here. First one, could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing with terms and conditions in the Business Insurance segment, any changes going on is the market getting maybe a little bit more generous in that area?", "Alan Schnitzer", "The short answer is no, we are not seeing anything significant. There is obviously always little movements up and down, but nothing dramatic that we are seeing.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Yes. Again hard to address doing our premium in one sentence, but by and large, there is nothing that we are looking at that\u2019s causing us to think differently about current results or outlook.", "Brian Meredith", "Got it. Deductibles are covered. Okay, great. And then a second question just curious if I look at your commercial auto, some premium growth going on there, is that largely rates driven or you are actually seeing opportunities in the commercial auto to pickup business here?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Yes, the short answer \u2013 this is Greg Toczydlowski. The short answer on that one is it\u2019s predominantly rate-driven across the portfolio. Our commercial auto book as we have shared in the past certainly hasn\u2019t been immune to some of the pressures that we are seeing across the entire industry on automobile. And accordingly, we have been pursuing rate on that. So, that\u2019s what you are seeing move through that top line. Because we are so much of an account solution, the retention has been pretty strong and so that gives us that net impact on the top line. So we are going to continue pursuing that strategy.", "Brian Meredith", "Great. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Next question, please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please proceed your question.", "Paul Newsome", "Good morning. Thanks for the call. I like to revisit that the little tick up we saw in the domestic business insurance from a rate perspective. And to your perspective, could you talk about how much that is you versus maybe the environment if we are assuming maybe a little bit of a tick up and awakening up of competition. We have seen a couple of surveys that suggest maybe sort of flatten your pricing and I just don\u2019t know how much to read into it?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Well, I would say, it\u2019s definitely both to some degree, right. I mean, it\u2019s us what we transact very deliberately on an account by account and class by class solution, so the rate we are getting is because we are trying to get the rate, but we are getting it because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and if the marketplace weren\u2019t letting as getting, we wouldn\u2019t be getting it. So, we are certainly not given the premium growth we have. So, I would say it\u2019s a combination of both. Now, I do think that we do have some advantages here maybe relative to the market. One, franchise value matters when it comes to pricing. So, product perhaps, relationships with distribution, which is valuable to our customers and our distribution, claims handling, risk control those things, I think really matter when it comes to the value we can deliver. And secondly, I would say we have got really important data and analytics and that helps us from a granular pricing perspective as well. So I would say it\u2019s the combination of the efforts the franchise value and competitive advantage that we have been in the marketplace.", "Paul Newsome", "Is there nothing in the competitive environment that you have seen any swings competitors moving it out or vice-versa or it is basically just kind of a general trend?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s a little soft. Can you repeat that?", "Paul Newsome", "Sorry, the soft is voice. Have you seen any actual trends or changes in your competitors themselves, anybody moving in and out or making any changes from a pricing perspective?", "Alan Schnitzer", "It\u2019s just \u2013 it would be so hard without taking it through competitor by competitor, business by business, geography by geography to give you a sense of that, but there is always movements, competitor by competitor, business by business, geography versus geography. And so to the extent we see any of that occurring now, it would be consistent with the way we see that type of dynamic over time. So, in that respect, I am not really.", "Paul Newsome", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay. Next question please.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.", "Josh Shanker", "Yes, thank you. A couple of questions on non-cat weather, I guess or maybe one. Allstate has taken the tax of reporting a much lower threshold for what they call catastrophe, but we should assume that of course there is going to be some level of cat activity in every quarter or every time they announced their numbers. When you talk but non-cat weather activity look over your data of the last 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, does that net \u2013 does the benefit and hindrance of non-cat weather net out to zero or is it a negative profit layer on the top of how we should look at things?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I am not sure, Josh, what you are asking. I mean, we have an expectation of what non-cat weather is going to do over time in a range and we set our prices in part based on that expectation. So whether it\u2019s a positive or negative over time is going to be a function of over time whether we are getting the right price for the losses. So, I don\u2019t \u2013 if you are asking sort of where it is in a particular period relative to a long-term average, we can give you that information too. But as I have said in my opening remarks, what we are seeing is certainly relatively high. There is no question about it, but not outside of what we would expect in the context of an over time range.", "Josh Shanker", "So when you say that three quarters of the personal lines deterioration is due to non-cat weather, that\u2019s non-cat weather above and beyond a layer of normal expectation?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Well, actually I think the number that you are talking about was a property number, but I think what we are explaining is a year-over-year variance. So, I think that the year-over-year variance, if I am remembering the number right, assuming like 4.6 points at least in home. And I think what Brian\u2019s comment was is that the lion\u2019s share of that is non-cat weather that was worse in the current quarter as compared to non-cat weather in the prior year quarter.", "Brian MacLean", "And then I did. So that\u2019s what I meant by the three quarters. I did also say in my comments that it was also significantly higher than our long-term average. So, maybe a little less than that other number whatever it might be, but still significantly higher than our long-term average and within a volatility as Alan said that isn\u2019t totally out of pattern. One of the tricky things with this, Josh, especially when we are talking about Homeowners but also with our commercial property, weather in totality makes up something between 40% and 50% of our total loss content. So, you are at some point you are almost talking about the loss ratio in aggregate, which if you are trying to include every single weather related loss. So it\u2019s\u2026", "Josh Shanker", "And just another avenue I guess of discussion, your results in Business Insurance continued to be very, very good regardless of weather the variance from a quarter ago. If you would accept 100 or 200 basis points lower level of profitability in that line of business, could you grow materially? Are you being \u2013 is there an opportunity that\u2019s not being met, because you are being so profitable than maybe you should relax profitably goals and instead grow?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, Josh. We have always thought that lowering price to generate incremental premium is a fool\u2019s errand, because we operate in a very competitive marketplace and you just end up with same relative market share at lower profitability. And once you lower the price and consequently lower the margins on the business you are keeping, then you got to write a whole lot of new business to get that margin back. So, we don\u2019t feel like that strategy. We like the strategy of again as I have priced on like a broken record, but on a very granular basis, looking at the accounts and classes of business that we are writing, we look at our loss cost in a yield curve and we calculated price that we think meets our return objective and that\u2019s the way we run the railroad. So, we don\u2019t like the strategy of lowering price to generate volumes.", "Josh Shanker", "Okay. Well, good luck and thank you for the answers.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Great. Thank you. This is what appears to be our last question.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed with your question.", "Larry Greenberg", "Good morning and thank you. Just wondering can you give us any color on the environmental strengthening whether the complexion of that was any different than it has been in the past. I know it\u2019s a little bit better than a year ago. Is there anything maybe extrapolate from that related to the third quarter, it\u2019s best to sort of view and are you guys thinking any differently about how you should be managing these exposures?", "Jay Benet", "Hey, Larry. This is Jay Benet. So, in relation to the environmental charge this year versus what we saw last year you are right it was moderated from the levels of the prior year. It continues to be an area of frustration. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019d call at the level of a nuisance at this point in time. We are not talking about very large dollars, but as you know every year we take a crack at what we think is going to happen with regard to new policyholders, what happens with regard to the active policyholders, what\u2019s taking place in relation to defense cost versus actual cleanup cost and we have to make lots of assumptions associated with that. A year goes by or 6 months or whatever the period of time is, we look at what\u2019s actually taking place versus those assumptions. And what we say in the Q is what I am going to repeat here that the favorable trends, we have been seeing for a number of years continue. They didn\u2019t continue quite at the level that we expected, but there was still favorable when it came to policies presenting new claims of policyholders with new claims or what\u2019s taking place with regard to other aspects of it. But as we have refined those estimates in this particular case we came up with an additional increase to the reserves. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s the lion\u2019s share of it. I will say that there are parts of the country of the Pacific Northwest in particular, where cleanup costs are being a little more elevated than what we had anticipated. So, you do have certain jurisdictional elements associated with this that will change what your estimates of costs are, but I will go back to what I said before that on the overall context of our reserve levels in Business Insurance in the company as a whole. This is fairly de minimis item at this point in time.", "Larry Greenberg", "And nothing defense cost wise to extrapolate to asbestos or anything else?", "Jay Benet", "No, I don\u2019t think you can really extrapolate what takes place in environmental to asbestos, but I think you can, if you can extrapolate anything, you can probably look at what other companies have said about the same subjects of the asbestos and environmental and recognize that we are no different than everybody else. So, I think we will continue to address each one of these things. We have our claims study ongoing as it relates to asbestos and we have more news to tell about.", "Larry Greenberg", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Excellent. This looks like we are wrapping up. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we are available on Investor Relations for any follow-up questions.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on October 19, 2017.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our third quarter 2017 results. Hopefully, all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast presentation released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investors section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer; and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer. They will discuss the financial results of our business and the current market environment. They will refer to the webcast presentation as they go through prepared remarks and then we will take questions.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors.

Also, in our remarks or responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement and other materials that available in the Investors section on our website travelers.com.", "And now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported third quarter net income of $293 million or $1.05 per diluted share and core income of $253 million or $0.91 per diluted share.", "The fact that we made a considerable profit in one of the costliest hurricane seasons on record demonstrates the earning power of our franchise which is built on strong foundation of underwriting and investment expertise.", "This is reflected in our manageable catastrophe losses, underlying underwriting gain of $292 million and after-tax net investment income of $457 million.", "Our catastrophe losses were well within what we would expect from the events in the quarter. Balancing risk and reward to generate leading results over time is in our DNA. While that's evident in our results this quarter, our underwriting discipline would have been even more evident if Hurricane Irma had taken the track to Miami up the East Coast of Florida which was projected just 48 hours before landfall.", "Notwithstanding 10 years of relatively moderate Atlantic storm activity, our investors should know we were well positioned for the very realty possibility of $150 billion industry event. That's not to say we'll never have a substantial or even an outsized loss from an event, its just to say that balancing risk and reward is always front and center for us.", "Our catastrophe underwriting also incorporates lessons learned over the years from events like hurricane Katrina and superstorm Sandy. Those lessons are reflected in our disciplined approach to terms and conditions which make outcomes more predictable, risk control initiatives, which make a difference in risk mitigation, selection, and pricing, and proprietary flood underwriting down to the address level.", "Our experience with the storms this quarter also reaffirms the competitive advantage in our claim model in terms of the value it delivers to our customers and agents and for our shareholders.", "Through military-like logistics capabilities and a sophisticated cross-training strategy, we have the capacity to conduct and we did conduct virtually 100% of our claim inspections for hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria with Travelers employees and that would have been the case even if Irma had taken that East Coast of Florida track, and even in that scenario our flexible model would have given us capacity to spare.", "As compared to an independent adjuster, we\u2019re confident that a highly trained and committed Travelers claim professional produces a better experience for our customers and a much more efficient outcome for us. To that point, we were successful this hurricane season in meeting our objective of having the vast majority of our property claims closed within 30 days of the event.", "Our response to the storms also included our largest deployment of our drilling fleet to date. We conducted more than a thousand inspections with drones, which significantly accelerates the speed and reduces the cost of handling those claims. Again, a better outcome for our customers and more efficient outcome for us.", "We own and operate all of our drones and we're on track to have more than 650 drones in regular operation around the country by the middle of next year.", "Moving beyond catastrophes, we are very pleased with the underlying performance of our businesses. In Business Insurance, the underlying combined ratio of 96.4 was solid, particularly in light of a high level of non-cat fire related losses. To a large degree we believe it was normal period to period volatility.", "Bond & Specialty Insurance produced another impressive quarter with an underlying combined ratio of 77.7. In Personal Insurance, the underlying results reflect loss trends within expectations, the continued success of the pricing and underwriting actions we began implementing in our auto business a year ago and the successful performance of our Property business.", "Notably, our consolidated expense ratio has improved 90 basis points year-to-date. The result is maintaining expense discipline, while investing strategically. For example, in Personal Insurance, over the last few years we've invested in product and marketing initiatives, platform improvements and distribution management, resulting in significant net written premium growth.", "In Business Insurance, we're investing in technology and enhancing work flow to be a better partner for our agents and brokers, deliver compelling value for our customers and improve our operating efficiency. We've made those investments on about flat G&A expense dollars. We're looking forward to sharing more about these initiatives with you at our Investor Day next month.", "Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace strategies, which resulted in 4% net written premium growth to a record $6.7 billion. Across our commercial businesses, we continue to be successful in achieving historically high retention rates, positive renewal premium change and an increase in new business.", "In business units accounting for around two-thirds of our business insurance premium, pure rate change in the quarter was higher both year-over-year and sequentially. In our personal auto business, our execution was spot on plan and we were again pleased to see continued momentum in our industry-leading homeowners business.", "There's been no lack of speculation around the outlook for pricing in the wake of an unprecedented hurricane season which still has six weeks to go and in the midst of an ongoing unprecedented wildfire season in California. Big events impact pricing when a material amount of industry surpluses eroded and/or when the events change the markets view of risk. It's not hard to make the argument that we've experienced both.", "By some estimates 10% or more of industry surplus and counting. The first time more than 1 Category 4 hurricane has made landfall on the U.S. mainland in one season. As devastating as it was, a very close call with Irma, and in the fourth quarter, forest fires that are burning not in forests but in subdivisions, and that's not to mention two earthquakes in Mexico and a cyber event impacting more than 140 million U.S. consumers. And while those events have understandably captured everyone's attention that's only part of the story.", "Interest rates remain at historically low levels. Loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now to a degree that many others in the industry are probably not earning their cost of capital. And insured losses from PCS cat events in each of the last four quarters have exceeded the 10 year average for that quarter.", "I can't predict what the market is going to do, but I will share with you what we're planning to do. As a component of our strategy to manage all the levers available to us to meet our return objectives, for more than a year now we've been discussing our efforts to improve renewal rate change and for more than a year now we've been making incremental but steady progress.", "The circumstances I've just described strengthen our resolve. We'll seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our distribution partners and in that regard we believe our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation, as opposed to the higher pricing swings of the past.", "Two final comments before I pass the microphone to Jay. First, I want to add my voice in support of the corporate tax reform efforts in Washington. As a country, addressing the corporate tax rate is important for enabling U.S. businesses to compete more effectively at home and abroad against our foreign counterparts.", "Beyond just the tax rate, we were particularly pleased to see that the big six framework for tax reform promotes levelling the playing field between U.S. and foreign companies. In addition to contributing to the country's tax base, it's important in addressing the decades-long streak of U.S. based Companies losing U.S. market share and American jobs to offshore companies. Case in point, a $2.5 billion transaction announced just yesterday.", "Finally I'd like to thank our claim organization for an extraordinary effort over these past few months. They've certainly risen to the occasion. It's an understatement to say that events like Harvey, Irma, and Maria and others that have been in the news are devastating and our thoughts and prayers are with all those who have been impacted.", "Events like those serve as reminders that in the end we sell a promise. We work hard to make sure that our agents and brokers are proud to sell that promise and that at every opportunity we demonstrate the value of that promise to our customers who buy it.", "And with that, let me turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks, Alan. Core income was $253 million down from $701 million in the prior-year quarter and core ROE was 4.5% down from 12.5%. As in the first half of the year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by fundamental changes in our underlying performance, rather they were reflective of the high level of cat activity this quarter.", "Beginning with underwriting results, our underlying underwriting gain remained strong, as evidenced by our 92.8% underlying combined ratio which was 0.7 points higher than the prior-year quarter. This slight increase was primarily due to a relatively high level of non-cat fire related losses in Business Insurance this quarter.", "Catastrophe losses were $455 million after-tax compared to only $58 million in the prior-year quarter. This increase of $397 million was driven by estimated losses from Hurricane Harvey of $319 million pre-tax or $207 million after-tax. Hurricane Irma of $242 million pre-tax or $157 million after-tax, and Hurricane Maria of $82 million pre-tax or $54 million after-tax.", "Net favourable prior-year reserve development which I'll discuss in more detail shortly was $10 million after-tax down from $27 million in the prior-year quarter. Net investment income of $457 million after-tax continued to be strong, although down $15 million from the prior-year quarter.", "Fixed income NII as anticipated was lower by $20 million after-tax due to the continued low interest rate environment, while non-fixed income NII increased by $5 million after-tax due to the strong private equity returns.", "Interestingly, when we look at the long-term bonds we hold that are maturing through the end of next year, along with growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio and higher short term interest rates, our outlook for after-tax fixed income NII during the remainder of 2017 and into 2018 is only slightly lower, $10 million or less quarter-over-quarter, as compared to the corresponding quarters in 2016 and 2017, an improvement from what we've been experiencing in recent years.", "Consolidated net favourable prior-year reserve development was $15 million pre-tax compared to $39 million in the prior-year quarter. Business Insurances net favourable reserve development was $9 million pre-tax compared to $4 million in the prior-year quarter, including an increase to asbestos reserves of $225 million pre-tax, the same amount as in the prior year quarter.", "Excluding the asbestos reserve increase, BI\u2019s net favourable reserve development was $234 million pre-tax, primarily driven by better-than-expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and GL, partially offset by higher-than-expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto.", "As has been the case in recent years, the asbestos reserve increase which related to a broad number of policyholders was driven by higher estimates for projected settlement and defense costs for mesothelioma claims than we had previously assumed.", "Notwithstanding these higher cost estimates, the underlying asbestos environment remained essentially unchanged from recent periods, as compared to our expectation that the environment would improve.", "As you may recall, the current asbestos environment, which has continued to result in periodic reserve strengthening for us and the industry is still much improved from the high severity environment of 10 to 15 years ago when risks from pre packaged bankruptcies, direct actions filed against insurers, and products, non-products coverage litigation among others led to very expensive settlement activity and a high degree of uncertainty in terns of the outlook.", "The asbestos environment and more recent years has been frequency driven, the result of people developing mesothelioma and unfortunately dying soon thereafter. Interestingly the most recent data from the Center for Disease Control which we've included on Page 19 of the webcast shows deaths from mesothelioma in 2015 the most recent data available was 7.5% lower than in 2014, and importantly, the age distribution of these deaths has shifted towards higher age groups, possibly due to more people who work with asbestos prior to the mid to late 70s, the high usage years, \"living into the disease.\"", "What that means is that recent medical advances that have successfully treated a variety of other deadly diseases seem to have enabled more people in this highly exposed cohort to live well into their 70s and 80s and then develop and die from mesothelioma. As nature takes its course this high risk cohort will get smaller over time and accordingly we continue to expect the currently high frequency claim environment to improve over time.", "Bond & Specialties net favourable development was $6 million pre-tax compared to $46 million in the prior-year quarter, while Personal Insurance had no reserve development compared to $11 million of unfavourable development in the prior-year quarter.", "Excluding A&E, year-to-date on a combined stat schedule P-basis for all of our subsidiaries all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favourably and other than some modest reserve strengthening for commercial auto, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favourably or had de minimis unfavourable development.", "Operating cash flows of over $1.6 billion was very strong and we ended the quarter with holding company liquidity of almost $2 billion, up from $1.7 billion at the beginning of the year. This higher than normal level of holding company liquidity provides funding for our $450 million of senior notes that mature in December.", "All of our capital ratios were at or better than target levels, net unrealized gains were $1.5 billion pre-tax or a $1 billion after-tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $86.73 and adjusted book value per share of $83.06 increased over 4% and 3% respectively from the beginning of the year.", "Despite the high level of cat losses, we returned $528 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter through dividends of $200 million and share repurchases of $328 million bringing total capital return to shareholders to $1.68 billion year-to-date.", "As we've stated for many years and repeated in this quarters 10-Q, the timing and actual number of shares we will purchase in the future will depend on earnings among a variety of other factors, so consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy, we're keeping our eyes on the California wildfires, which we expect will be a significant cat for us as we evaluate share repurchase activity for the fourth quarter.", "With that let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks, Jay. Starting with this quarter's results in Business Insurance, segment income of $105 million and the combined ratio of 109.8% were both impacted by the significant catastrophe events in the quarter.", "The underlying combined ratio of 96.4% was 2.3 points higher than the third quarter of 2016 with the underlying loss ratio increasing 3.4 points. The quarterly loss ratio was impacted by an unusually high number of large non-cat property, primarily fire losses and so the year-to-date results are better indication of how the business is performing.", "On the year-to-date basis the underlying loss ratio is up 1.7 points, 70 basis points of which is due to the large loss volatility I just mentioned, with the remaining about a point driven by loss trend in excessive earned pricing.", "For the quarter, the underlying expense ratio decreased 1.1 points year-over-year. As with the loss ratio, there are normal fluctuations impacting the quarterly comparison. The year-to-date decline of about a 0.5 is a better indication of our current run rate with the decline driven by both growing earned premium and slightly lower G&A expense dollars.", "Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up more than a point year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 2% driven by strong production results in middle market.", "International net written premiums were down 3% driven by reinsurance reinstatement premiums related to the cats that occurred in the quarter. Excluding the impact of reinstatement international was up 1%.", "Turning to domestic production. We were pleased that retention for the quarter of 85% remained at a historically high level. Renewal premium change was strong at about three points in the quarter with rate change that was up slightly from last quarter and up a half a point from a year ago. New business of $434 million was up 6% versus the prior-year.", "Looking at the individual businesses, I'll begin with Select, where production statistics remained strong, with retention for the quarter of 83%, renewal premium change was nearly five points, while new business premiums of $98 million were up 4% year-over-year.", "In middle market our results reflect consistent performance in the marketplace as demonstrated by another quarter of strong retention at 87%. Renewal premium change of three points was down slightly from the second quarter due to lower exposure growth, while rate increases of nearly a point were up year-on-year and in line with the second quarter.", "New business of $267 million was up 12% versus the prior-year quarter. We attribute a large portion of this to great execution in the market by our field organization, particularly as it relates to larger accounts in industry segments that we like.", "We're also encouraged by how our investments in technology are enabling our underwriters to be more active in the market, we'll talk more about that at our upcoming Investor Day.", "So all-in quarter that was significantly impacted by the weather and we were pleased with our execution in the marketplace. Our fundamental marketplace strategy remains unchanged. We seek to retain our best performing business, while thoughtfully managing the profitability of the book.", "Importantly, the market and environmental circumstances that Alan outlined earlier further support our ability to successfully execute on this strategy.", "I'll now turn to Bond & Specialty insurance where segment income for the quarter was strong at $136 million though down somewhat from the prior year quarter due to a lower level of net favourable prior year reserve development. The underlying combined ratio improved nearly a point from the prior year quarter to under 78%.", "As to the top line, net written premiums for the quarter were up 2% reflecting growth in both our domestic management liability and international businesses, with the international growth driven by strong production in both our Canadian surety and UK management liability businesses.", "Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we ", "continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments. So we couldn't be more pleased that retention came in at a record high of 89% for the quarter, the fourth consecutive quarter of 88% or better, while new business was up slightly from the third quarter of last year.", "Renewal premium change of 3.5 points was up slightly from the second quarter due to a modest increase in exposure growth. So Bond & Specialty results remain terrific and we continue to feel great about the segments performance and our market positions.", "Turning to Personal Insurance. Net written premiums for the segment grew 9% in the quarter with more than half of that growth coming from higher pricing. Despite 8.7 points of catastrophe losses in the quarter, Personal Insurance generated $77 million of segment income with a third quarter combined ratio of 99.7%. The underlying combined ratio of 91% improved about 1.5 point\u2019s year-over-year.", "The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 106% and included 7.2 points of cat losses, far above our normal third quarter auto cat load expectation of about a 0.5. Compared to the third quarter of 2016, the underlying combined ratio is down 2.3 points.", "As you can see on page 15 of the webcast, 1.3 points of the decrease is due to continued improvement in the expense ratio, as we leverage a consistent level of operating expenses over a larger premium base.", "The remaining point of decrease is primarily due to the fact that the third quarter of 2016 loss ratio included the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury severity reestimation.", "As we discussed in previous calls, in response to higher bodily injury loss levels, we are taking actions to improve profitability, most notably by improving the pricing of the book. As a result, renewal premium change increased from 7.9% in the second quarter to 9.5% in the third quarter reaching 10.5% for the month of September.", "We expect that renewal premium change will remain in double-digits for the fourth quarter and as we told you previously, by year-end we will have obtained enough rate on a written basis to address the elevated bodily injury loss levels.", "Retention declined modestly in the quarter as expected, but remained strong by historical standards even as we implement meaningful price increases through the book.", "This growth has decelerated but remain positive driven by lower levels of new business. Importantly, we remain on track to achieving the goals we laid out for the auto book back in January.", "Turning to agency homeowners and other, the combined ratio of 90.3% for the quarter reflects 12.2 points of cat losses. The underlying combined ratio of 78.1% was in line with the quarter, third quarter of 2016, as net trend was offset by the impact of volume on the expense ratio.", "Homeowners net written premiums increased 5% in the quarter, somewhat accelerating the momentum we had experienced in recent quarters. As a reminder, we have made a concerted effort to generate growth in this profitable line even as we moderate the growth in auto.", "Process and technology improvements have made it easier for agents and brokers to do business with us and we have focused on adding more property oriented distribution partners and increasing our average number of policies per customer.", "Overall in Personal Insurance, setting aside the significant impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter, both the agency auto and homeowners results were in line with our expectations and both lines continued to make good progress towards the goals we laid out at the end of last year.", "So stepping back and looking across the franchise, while the headline for the quarter is obviously the cats, we feel very good about our underlying results. Considering our significant competitive advantages, the investments that we're making to extend them and to develop additional advantages and our ability to execute, we believe each of our businesses is positioned for continued success.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. We're now ready to open it up to Q&A and if I can ask you to please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you, and good morning. My first question is on the outlook for the core combined ratio for the Business Insurance segments. In your 10-Q, you said broadly consistent into 2018. Could you add like what pass through as sort of component of it in terms of your sort of loss \u2013 core loss ratio deterioration and also potential normalization of non-cat losses, as well as the improvements in expense ratio and does your forecast including like a probably better pricing outlook?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, Kai. Good morning, it's Alan. Thanks for the question. Let me start with it. We're going to try not to in the outlook try to break this down between the components of loss and expense. We give you a sense as best we can looking at our crystal ball which is never perfect and the world is never going to turn out exactly as we thought, but we try to give you as good a sense as we can on the overall profitability by segment.", "In terms of the rate in particular, you can see the written rate that we've been getting and obviously you can see for example, in BI, quarter-over-quarter, and so that will of course earn in and that will be a component of what gets reflected in our outlook, as will the impact of the expense ratio that you see in the nine months, but we're going to try not to break it down between the loss and expense ratio component.", "Kai Pan", "Okay. My follow-up question on reserves, there are actually two components to that, one is on asbestos, you've been taking charge of about $200 million a year for many years that we know and so why don't you take a big charge upfront or are you considering reinsurance transaction?", "The commercial auto site was driven that and is that - like has that - do you pick up that like increase your like current year, accident year loss pick on the commercial auto line as well? Thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, let me start with the auto side and then I'll ask Jay Benet to comment on the reserves. On the auto, we've been seeing and talking about some severity on the commercial auto side for some time and we've been addressing it.", "We view this as a tweak to those reserves in prior year periods and you know, think about it's $40 billion reserve increase on a couple of $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base, $2 billion or $3 billion reserve base. So we look at that and we don't over react to it. It's just the normal process of every quarter we go through and we look at our reserves and look at the trends and the cases we've got out there and true it up. So it's not anything that has to any significant degree impacted our view of loss trend or what's happening in the current year period. Jay, do you want to address the asbestos?", "Jay Benet", "Yes, thanks. As it relates to the asbestos like every other reserve we take our best shot looking at all of the data we have available at points in time to evaluate what the reserve should be, and as part of that, we're making assumptions as to what the future looks like with regard to the level of activity that it will take place in terms of meso deaths and also look at what kind of settlement costs or litigation costs we face, and come up with as I said our best estimate, and what's been taking place over the last several years, as we said in our description of the environment is the environment really hasn't changed very much, but the assumptions we've made that possibly would lead to a fall off in the amount of activity just haven't borne out.", "So there\u2019s nothing about our reserve increase that reflects a dramatically changing environment and we thought we\u2019d add some color to it this quarter with regard to this page we added to the webcast as it relates to what's been taking place in the various cohorts associated with mesothelioma deaths and we'll see what happens in the future. But as it relates to making any change in process or whatever we didn't think that was appropriate.", "Alan Schnitzer", "And Kai, as it relates to the reinsurance you asked that as well. We certainly try to evaluate as best we can from the outside every deal we see announced by others and we are talking to the same people that are on the other side of those transactions evaluating them for us.", "So no lack of analysis on our end or looking into it. If we found a deal that we thought really made a difference from an economic perspective we would certainly be interested that.", "We certainly see transactions that provide some limited duration benefit in terms of the GAAP accounting, but when we look at it from an economic basis and get down to the cash flows, we just haven't seen one yet that makes sense for us.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. And our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks and good morning. I was hoping to touch base on the Business Insurance outlook for commercial insurance pricing. Alan, I believe in your commentary, you talked about seeking thoughtful rate increases in conjunction with your distribution partners, and keeping pricing ahead of loss cost inflation.", "Given all of the factors that we've seen driving up large losses in the current quarter and into 4Q, can you talk a little bit more in terms of the outlook there?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah. We've been saying for some time Jay that for over a year now as we look at our book and we look down the road out at the horizon that we're going to need to improve written rate to meet our return objectives as part of our overall strategy and we've been doing that for some time and you can see we've had some incremental but steady success in it.", "And when we look at the factors, when we look at the weather we had in the third quarter, when we look at some of the other things going on in the world, that's what's captured everyone's attention. I actually don't think that's the bigger part of the story.", "I think the bigger part of the story are the underlying dynamics that are driving the overall margins and profitability in this business. And when we look at that and we look at the accounts that we have, we say that it's time to move a little bit.", "We're not executing towards a headline number. You take all our accounts and we take all our accounts and we segment them very thoughtfully and for some time we've been getting rate in excessive loss trend on the accounts that are most returned challenge for us and we're getting to a point where our need to get rate is sort of extending up the continuum and that's reflected in the fact that this quarter we got rate on the higher percentage of our accounts than we did last quarter and the quarter before that et cetera, et cetera and its been our intention to lead into that.", "And the events of this quarter and the overall circumstances that I've described caused us to say that we're going to lien into it a little bit more and we feel a little bit more confident in our ability to achieve it.", "Jay Gelb", "Makes sense. Thanks. And then my follow-up is on personal auto. The underlying combined ratio for auto was \u2013 it was improved to around a 99% and I believe last quarter, the company was talking about kind of a longer term target of 96% to 98% plus some 10 year impact. Clearly, you're getting closer there. How soon before you think we can get into the range?", "Michael Klein", "Hey, Jay. This is Michael Klein from Personal Insurance. Thanks for the question. And first, thanks for noticing that the underlying combined ratio was below a hundred and actually improved year-on-year. That's actually the first time in a while that that's been the case.", "Brian gave the main drivers of the quarter-over-quarter change. I think to your question, you know what's the longer term outlook, we think really, there are two or three really key questions there.", "One is when are we in terms of pricing, where are we in terms of pricing for the increased bodily injury loss estimates that we recognized in the back half of last year.", "The second is 10 year playing out the way we anticipated and the third really is you know, at the core of your question what's our outlook for personal auto profitability and I'll just take those three real quickly in turn.", "Brian did mention we'll have achieved enough rate on our written basis by the end of 2017 to cover the increased level of bodily injury losses. That's on a written basis, so on an earned basis we remain on track to have done that by the end of \u201818 which is consistent with that 18 to 24 month timeframe that we laid out at the beginning of the year.", "With respect to 10 year, just a couple comments. One, it's important to note that the reason we spiked that out initially was that it had an outsized impact on these kind of period to period comparisons due to the elevated levels of new business that we were writing.", "As we've talked about the impact of 10 year from one period to the next, the delta that it drives dissipates as new business levels return to normal and as the portfolio matures, which is what's begun to happen in 2017.", "So from this point forward, 10 year becomes less of an anomaly quarter-over-quarter and just one of many factors that you need to think about as you look at our results. I think what's most important to takeaway this quarter as respect to personal auto as we have begun to turn the corner on profitability.", "Earned rate is exceeding loss trend and it's combining with underwriting and process changes, growth and expense ratio reduction to drive that improving underlying profitability that you see.", "As noted in our outlook, we expect underlying profitability and agency auto to improve over the next four quarters relative to the comparable prior periods. I would remind you given we're going into the fourth quarter that fourth quarter is a relatively high combined ratio period from a seasonality perspective, so you've got to sort of factor that into your overall evaluations.", "But at the end of the day, we feel good about the progress we're making towards our target combined ratio and that progress will continue through 2018 and into 2019.", "Jay Gelb", "Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Randy Binner with FBR. Please proceed.", "Randy Binner", "Hi, good morning. Thanks. I had a question on the cat losses coming in quite a bit lower particularly with Harvey kind of coming in below the previously guided range. What changed there so dramatically? Did it have to deal with the number of total vehicles or your ability to close claims as you commented earlier in the call? Just trying to get a sense of kind of what improved and how settled the claim activity there is on Harvey and the other hurricanes?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, Randy, it's Alan. I'll start and maybe Jay will have something to add, but the only reason that we gave a view on Harvey is because we were speaking at a conference that wasn't FD compliance and we wanted to talk about it at that conference and so we made a disclosure about it.", "That was relatively near to the event and so there was a relatively higher degree of uncertainty around our losses at that point, and so the range we gave reflected what we thought and all the information and uncertainty we had at the time, and we've had a significant amount of time elapse from then to now. We've had the opportunity to inspect virtually all of our claims and as I said, the vast majority of our property claims are closed.", "Not that there's no uncertainty left, but we feel much better from a certainty perspective and are confident in the number we put up. So I would really say nothing dramatically changed. It was the passage of time that gave us more insight into the losses.", "Randy Binner", "Well, given that comfort, and would buyback be able to resume maybe earlier than would have been the case if there was more demand surge or other aspects making the tail longer on the claims?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, you know, we - in terms of the storms in the third quarter, we ended the third quarter with our balance sheet in very strong shape, so there's nothing from the third quarter where we feel like we've got to build back a capital deficit to any degree at all.", "So the fourth quarter will be business as usual in the sense that we'll look at what our earnings are expected to be and we'll consider buybacks accordingly. As Jay said in his prepared remarks, the wildfires are out there. That's an ongoing event that will be significant for us and so we'll evaluate that in our fourth quarter outlook for earnings as we make decisions about buybacks.", "Randy Binner", "Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thanks, good morning, I just had a couple I think for Brian. I guess the first one is if you were to just look at accounts where there were Q3 property losses on the Business Insurance side or maybe those that didn't even have losses but were in loss affected geographies, what's been the conversation I guess so far about with renewals? What's been the magnitude of rate increases or how those conversations have gone? Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "You know, so and I missed a little bit of the beginning. You said accounts of 32- 3Q, I am sorry, yeah. So, I think it's - some of the stuff is obvious. In the really cat-exposed areas, the conversations are very clear. The perspective on the flood risk, the exposure to the wind, we were reminded once again of what those are, so there's more momentum there.", "But I think that it's more what Alan said in his opening. The overall environment of what we've been seeing in property. Two or three years ago we were saying that the line was in very healthy condition and although experiencing some price decreases. ", "The largest price decreases we were seeing in the book a couple years ago we thought it was a healthy line and we would manage it. A couple years later that compounding has impacted the core profitability. So we're looking at that.", "We're also seeing a little bit of inflation running through the book of business and that is you know in the labor and material side, a number that wouldn't even be big enough to warrant a comment other than the fact that we're beginning to see the line is already under some pressure and the potential for demand surge out of all of the cat activity is making that more dramatic. So a bunch of stuff going on in the line today and we think there's an opportunity to improve the profitability there.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay, I guess my follow-up was just thinking about just the potential for further favourable or unfavourable developments in these events. I notice in the Q that the commercial property IBNR looked like it as up about $300 mill quarter-over-quarter.", "I guess just as you think about the losses you've reported where do you see the I guess, the greatest potential for uncertainty from here on out? Thanks.", "Jay Benet", "Any time you have large cats, you're settling claims quickly, but generally, those claims that you're settling are more straightforward ones. So when you look at the level of IBNR, that remains a great deal of uncertainty associated with the cat losses.", "So you know, we'll take - we've taken our best shot based on all of the information that we have available and we can't predict whether that will actually be higher or lower than what this will ultimately come out to be. I think we have a good track record of being fairly good at these estimates, but there is a lot of IBNR at this point in time.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thank you for the answers.", "Jay Benet", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar with Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks and good morning. Two questions if I might. The first question goes back to the discussion on pricing. If I were to take that comment and sort of flip it towards the reinsurance side, how do you expect those discussions with their re-insurers to go? Do you expect to sort of hold the line on pricing based on your outlook or just maybe help us understand that equation a bit better?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Amit, I don't think we've got a lot of insight to give you on that. Obviously, we'll be thinking about it over the coming weeks and months, and I guess one reason we're not particularly preoccupied by this, we don't buy all that much reinsurance. We're gross line underwriter. We like our underwriting and so we don't buy that much. So on a relative basis we're less impacted by that.", "I would hope that our thoughtful underwriting as it was demonstrated in these storms would factor into whatever pricing we negotiate when it comes up, but it's just not something we spend a lot of time running our hands over.", "Amit Kumar", "Got it. That's a fair comment. Switching back to the discussion on Business Insurance. If you look at the mix of BI, 50% of the book is comp international and GL. Do you think these cat losses give you an ability to enforce some incremental rate action in the non-cat impacted lines or do you think that this somewhat gets relegated to the exposed line set at this juncture?", "Alan Schnitzer", "You know, Amit, you've got commercial auto on one end of the spectrum, you've got workers comp on the other end of the spectrum and everything else sort of falls in the middle in terms of where it is in terms of rate adequacy.", "But what I would tell you though and one of the reasons why in my prepared remarks I was so deliberate about talking not just about the storms that is captured everyone's attention, but about the other underlying factors in the business is those are real.", "Things like where interest rates are, things like what weather has done, we've got pricing and loss trend over several years that that impacts all the lines. So we view the - our pricing objectives I should say go beyond the property line, really extend across all our lines and all our geographies. So we're not thinking of this as property-related or coastal related. We're thinking about it much more broadly.", "Amit Kumar", "Fair point. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi, good morning. My first question, I'm just trying to get a feel as we think about flood risk here, obviously a big component of the Harvey loss. How much of flood-related risk came through your commercial lines exposure and as you think about going forward is there an opportunity both on the commercial line side and then also maybe depending upon what happens with the national flood program to potentially write more flood risk both within your commercial and personal lines businesses?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, Elyse it's Alan, I'll start and see if Brian has anything to add, but Harvey was by and large a flooding event for us and as it turns out, our underwriting held up and we feel good about it. It's not, you know, we have a pretty good market share in the State and our losses we think are reflected of the fact that we do have proprietary address by address flood underwriting that really stood up to it and so we feel good about it.", "Whether there's incremental opportunity, you know, after every one of these big events we take a step back and we think about how we feel about our exposures and how we feel about opportunity and what the lessons learned are from that event and how we apply those to exposure elsewhere.", "So we will be going through a post-mortem process and assessing how we feel about our coastal flood exposure and we may look at that and say, boy we could take on a little bit more. We may look at it and say we're just right or we may look at it and say we would like a little bit less and we're in that process, but it could be we find more opportunity there.", "On the personal line side, I think that's a much more complicated question and you get into the NFIP. It's really hard to compete with the government program that prices at the discount that it does and as long as there's that program out there, pricing at the discounts at actuarially sound rates, you know, it's not going to be an opportunity for us or anybody.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. And then my second question, earlier on the call you guys did mention that the California fires would be a significant loss. How do we think through the losses there and the potential business interruption claims from some of the wineries that are obviously very significantly impacted from this event? Any color you can just give there? Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, we're as interested in it as you are. I would say it's early. The event is ongoing, and it's hard for us to give a sense right now, so I'm not sure what else to add there.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen", "Thank you. Most of my questions have been answered. Just one quick follow-up. The elevated fire losses and the Business Insurance segment, can you talk about or quantify what the impact was in the quarter on the loss ratio?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yeah, in the quarter, Jay, think around two points.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Maybe a tic higher, but two, two and a half something like that.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Hi, good morning. Just following up on the pricing discussion. When you talk about pushing prices to keep pace with loss trends, should we interpret that as Business Insurance renewal rates should move closer to about 2% versus the 1% right now?", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, you know, well first good morning, Sarah. Thanks for the question. I think that's a broader brush than we think about it. I think what you should takeaway is more than the one you see now.", "We talk about loss trend being for and we\u2019d like to get to a point where we've got rate and the component of exposure that behaves like rate offsetting inflation and maybe even improving from there. So - but the other thing I would tell you is we're intent on doing this in a way that is thoughtful and controlled and close partnership with our agents and brokers and doing it in a way that isn't disruptive to our customers and we think that's actually a much better model for them.", "So this isn't anything we need to achieve tomorrow or next week or all one fell swoop next quarter. This is going to be a gradual process over time.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Sure, great. That makes sense. And then just when you say the loss trend being four, is that what you're actually realizing right now or is that what you're booking your reserves at looking at a longer term trend, but I thought maybe more recently its been coming in lower than that?", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, the four is a broad number and it covers our whole Business Insurance premium base. So obviously, there's variation among the products and businesses within that, and the fact that we've had as much PYD as we've had over recent years suggests that it's come in lower than that.", "We don't, in terms of our pricing, expect that that's going to continue forever. We expect that over time loss trend is going to return to a longer term average and so our longer term outlook continues to be four.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Okay, great.", "Jay Benet", "But that's a very broad observation.", "Sarah DeWitt", "Sure. Thanks for the answers.", "Jay Benet", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Please proceed.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. Good morning. Is there - let me think, how does the fact that people are living into the asbestos-related diseases impact your thinking about permanent injuries on the worker's compensation side?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Say that again, Meyer?", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. So on the asbestos side one of the factors driving the adverse reserve development is the fact that people are living longer, so asbestos-related diseases are manifesting themselves, there are claims associated with them and I'm wondering if people are living longer how is that impacting worker's compensation reserving?", "Brian MacLean", "So this is Brian. I'll take a shot. So obviously, we are factoring into everything we look at in worker's comp and permanent injuries, lifetime injuries into - we're looking at the actuarial life expectancies and given the injuries that the workers have, what is their life span and no question that advances in medicine in general have extended that period over time.", "So I think it's a lot of the same information is - but that's been embedded in our numbers forever, really. We've always looked at it that way, so I don't think there's anything fundamentally new there.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. And then one small question I guess. Within BI, there's a $21 million expense for non-insurance G&A. I was wondering if you could talk through, what's going on there, what that is?", "Jay Benet", "Yeah, what you're saying, we closed the acquisition of Simply Business this quarter, so what you're going to start seeing is the G&A expense is going to be influenced by what's taking place with regard to their expense base, and from the other side of the coin, the other revenue line is where their revenue numbers are getting consolidated, so that will just work its way through our consolidated results going forward.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay. Is this a good run rate, the $21 million of expenses?", "Jay Benet", "Well, we acquired them, we closed on the acquisition in August, so it's not quite a full quarter.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I'm also not sure that on such a small component that we're necessarily going to give a perspective on a run rate expense versus strategic initiative like that. It's all factored into our outlook and margins for the segment.", "Jay Benet", "There's also costs associated with the acquisition itself that are flowing through that and so I wouldn't look at it at this point as a run rate, but you can develop it over time. I think ultimately what you'll see is if you look at what's taking place with regard to revenues versus expenses, in total, it's not a big delta.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay, perfect. Thanks so much.", "Jay Benet", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi\u2019", "And the will be our last question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. This question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes, thank you. First question, I think for Michael. On the personal auto business, is there a way to kind of dissect it where you can give us perspective of how much the improved frequency the industry is seeing that is benefiting you versus what's happening with 10 year and some of the underwriting initiatives that's happening?", "Michael Klein", "Sure, Brian. I would say as with respect to the industry trend information, we've seen the second quarter ISOFastTrack data taking a look at it. I would make - I think the same comment we typically make about that data which is it's paid data. It's an interesting data point and certainly not complete, but as we look at the ISOFastTrack data, we look at our own trend experience, you know, we think those results are relatively consistent with what we're seeing.", "As I mentioned in the earlier questions, sort of dissecting the components, you know, not a lot of change - and I think that I mentioned this, as you think about all of the dimensions underneath the underlying combined ratio there's not really any significant change in any of them this quarter.", "Brian Meredith", "Okay, great. And then my second question, just curious you mentioned the cyber loss obviously with Equifax, upfront and there's been some others. Any change in kind of your view of the cyber business here as a result of what's going on, what does the market look like now for cyber? Is that becoming a more attractive growth area at this point?", "Michael Klein", "Yes, stepping back I would say that there's an increasing awareness and consciousness in the mind of the risk manager and whether that's a job description for somebody in a big company or proprietor in a small business. I think there's a greater sense of the need for the product and we think that's a healthy thing and we think to a degree that we'll be there to help solve that problem.", "Having said that, we are extraordinarily mindful that it's an emerging risk and there's a lot about it we know and there's a lot about it we don't know and that gets factored into the way we think about the industries we want to write in, the individual risks we want to write, the lines we put out, the reinsurance programs that we have. And so we do think that it will continue to be a growing opportunity and we will continue to be cautious in the way we approach it.", "Brian Meredith", "Great, thank you.", "Michael Klein", "Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you very much for joining us today, and also we look forward to seeing a number of you at our Investor Day on November 13th. Thank you very much and have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference call for today.

We ask that you hold all questions until the completion of formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question and answer session. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded on January 23, 2018.", "At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Ms. Gabriella Nawi, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Ms. Nawi, you may begin.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Travelers\u2019 discussion of our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. Hopefully all of you have seen our press release, financial supplement and webcast materials released earlier this morning. All of these materials can be found on our website at www.travelers.com under the Investor section.", "Speaking today will be Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and CEO; Jay Benet, Chief Financial Officer, and Brian MacLean, Chief Operating Officer.

Our presentation today includes forward-looking statements. The company cautions investors that any forward-looking statement involves risks and uncertainties and is not a guarantee of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of factors. These factors are described in our earnings press release and in our most recent 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC. We do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements. ", "Also, in our remarks and responses to questions, we may mention some non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations are included in our recent earnings press release, financial supplement, and other materials available in the Investors section of our website, travelers.com.", "Now, Alan Schnitzer.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you, Gabby. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning, we reported fourth quarter core income of $633 million, generating a core return on equity of a little over 11%. That brings our full-year core income to $2.43 billion and full-year core return on equity to 9%. The fact that we were able to generate that level of profit and profitability given the extraordinary catastrophe losses for the industry this quarter and year on top of a decade of historically low interest rates and several years of a relatively soft pricing environment speaks to the earnings power of the franchise. It\u2019s the value of our competitive advantages, starting with underwriting excellence and investment expertise.", "For the year, catastrophe losses were manageable and we generated an after-tax underlying underwriting gain in excess of $1.2 billion and after-tax net investment income of nearly $1.9 billion. Our results and strong balance sheet enabled us to grow adjusted book value per share by 4% during the year after returning $2.2 billion of excess capital to our shareholders. As I\u2019ll share in a minute, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018.", "Overall, we were pleased with our underlying combined ratio of 92.6% for the year, which was impacted by high levels of non-cat weather and non-cat fire-related losses relative to our expectations. Underneath that, our commercial businesses continue to perform well. For the year, business insurance delivered a strong underlying combined ratio of 94.9%. Bond and specialty insurance delivered an impressive underlying combined ratio of 83.2% even after a charge in the fourth quarter for a single surety loss outside the United States. In personal insurance, we were pleased with an underlying combined ratio in the quarter of 90.4%, bringing the full year to 91.5%. Those results reflect continued success in our leading property business, loss trends in personal auto within expectations, and the continued successful execution of the pricing and underwriting actions we\u2019ve been taking in the auto business all year.", "Notably, our consolidated expense ratio was down 80 basis points for the year as we grew earned premium by almost 5%, continued to invest in the strategic initiatives we discussed with you at our recent investor day, and delivered on our objective of improving productivity and efficiency, which resulted in about flat G&A expense dollars. ", "Turning to the top line, we were very pleased with the success of our marketplace execution which resulted in full-year net written premium growth of 5% to a record $26.2 billion. Importantly, in domestic business insurance in the quarter, renewal rate change reached 1.4 points, doubling from the third quarter, and renewal premium change reached 4 points. For both measures, that\u2019s the highest levels in about three years. Brian will give you more texture on the execution underneath the headlines, including a view by line, but I\u2019ll note that we achieved renewal rate gains in the quarter more broadly across our product portfolio and our accounts compared to recent periods. It\u2019s an acceleration of a trend in improved pricing we\u2019ve achieved over the past six quarters as the market started reacting to two things: first, the hurricanes and wildfires in the back half of the year; and second and more significant in my view, declining margins generally as interest rates remain at historically low levels and loss trend has outpaced rate and exposure for a few years now.", "As we\u2019ve doing all year and as I reiterated last quarter, we\u2019ll continue to seek rate thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners with the belief that our customers are well served by a stable and predictable market that keeps pace with inflation as opposed to more dramatic price swings of the past. Given our sense of the market and the fact that retentions remain at historic highs, we\u2019re encouraged.", "Aside from the pricing environment, new business in domestic business insurance was up in the quarter and for the year. We explained at our recent investor day that a number of the initiatives we have underway are designed to create more top line opportunities for us. It\u2019s still early days, but what we can see so far is positive. Our marketplace execution in both bond and specialty insurance and personal insurance was equally successful. ", "In our management liability business, we maintained retention at an impressive 88% throughout the year with stable renewal premium change and higher new business volume. Surety premium was higher both in the quarter and for the year as a result of an increase in large bond activity. Personal insurance finished the year with another quarter of accomplishing our objectives of improving auto profitability while maintaining momentum in our leading homeowners business. We achieved 11 points of renewal premium change in auto, enough to offset the bodily injury severity we identified in the second half of 2016 on a written basis, and delivered policy in force growth throughout the year in our homeowners business. ", "As it relates to the market generally, there has been a lot of speculation about how corporate tax reform will impact pricing. Stepping back, we price our products with return objectives in mind. The tax rate is just one factor impacting the pricing we need to achieve in order to reach our return objectives. Other factors, for example, include the adequacy of expiring prices, loss trends, expenses, the cost of reinsurance, the impact of claims initiatives and so on. Speaking for us, tax reform will help shrink the gap between where returns are trending and where we\u2019d like them to be trending, but it doesn\u2019t completely close the gap. Also, not every participant in the marketplace will benefit from tax reform, and even among those who do, the extent of the benefit varies. In short, for us tax reform helps, but we still have ground to cover.", "As I said a minute ago, we\u2019re encouraged about the outlook for 2018. We\u2019re well positioned to benefit from continued improvement in the pricing environment, the opportunities afforded by a more level playing field for domestic insurers as a result of tax reform, and the prospect of a strengthening economy. With that wind at our backs and from a position of strength, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our competitive advantages, focusing on extending our lead in risk expertise, improving the experience for our customers, agents and brokers, and enhancing productivity and efficiency. We believe we\u2019re well positioned to continue to create shareholder value.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Jay.", "Jay Benet", "Thanks Alan. Core income was $633 million, down from $919 million in the prior year quarter, while core ROE was 11.1%, down from 16.4%. As has been the case all year, these reductions in core income and core ROE were not driven by changes in our underlying performance. Our underlying performance remains strong and actually improved over the prior year quarter. Rather, these reductions were reflective of a continued high level of cat activity and the inclusion of an $82 million after-tax benefit in the prior year quarter from the settlement of a reinsurance dispute.", "The strength of our underlying underwriting results is evidenced by our consolidated underlying combined ratio of 92.4%, similar to the 92% we produced in the prior year quarter. Cat losses were $324 million after tax compared to only $89 million in the prior year quarter. This $235 million increase was driven by losses from the California wildfires of $426 million after tax, comprising $382 million after tax for the October wildfires in northern California and $44 million after tax for the December wildfires in southern California, partially offset by current year net favorable development of $102 million after tax for catastrophes that occurred earlier this year, almost all of which related to the third quarter hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. ", "For both Harvey and Irma, the benefits of our underwriting actions over many years, including management of overall exposure, limits and deductibles, resulted in more favorable claim outcomes than we had expected. For Maria, given that the storm occurred late in the third quarter and access to the impacted areas was extremely limited, our estimate was based on an exposure analysis. That initial estimate has come down due to our receiving fewer claims than we had expected. ", "Net favorable prior year reserve development, for which I\u2019ll provide more details shortly, was $192 million after tax, up from $172 million in the prior year quarter. Net investment income of $467 million after-tax, while continuing to be strong, was down $26 million from the prior year quarter. Non-fixed income NII decreased by $19 million after tax due to lower private equity returns which, although strong, were not as strong as in the prior year quarter. Fixed income NII, as anticipated, was lower by $8 million after tax due to the continued low interest rate environment. Taking into account long-term bonds that are scheduled to mature in 2018, growth in the size of our fixed income portfolio, higher short-term interest rates and the new U.S. tax law, we expect that after-tax fixed income NII for 2018 will be $25 million to $30 million higher quarter over quarter as compared to corresponding quarters in 2017, a significant improvement from recent years.", "Relative to what several other companies have disclosed, the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 had a relatively modest impact on our fourth quarter results, a $129 million charge recorded as part of net income. This charge resulted mostly from revaluing our net deferred tax asset as of the enactment date using the new 21% tax rate and, to a lesser extent, providing on the taxes on the deemed repatriation of our foreign earnings. I should also mention that we executed some tax-related actions in the fourth quarter that provided real economic benefits while having an insignificant impact on fourth quarter 2017 core and net income, but slightly increasing our fourth quarter consolidating combined ratio primarily through the expense ratio by about half a point. Under the new tax law, muni bond investment income will continue to be taxed at 5.25% while all other U.S.-based income will be taxed at 21% rather than 35%, so looking forward, you should update your models.", "Consolidated net favorable prior year reserve development was $293 million pre-tax compared to $264 million in the prior year quarter. Business insurance\u2019s net favorable reserve development was $244 million pre-tax compared to $221 million in the prior year quarter primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic workers comp and commercial multi-peril, partially offset by higher than expected loss experience in domestic commercial auto. Bond and specialty net favorable development was $42 million pre-tax compared to $79 million in the prior quarter, primarily driven by better than expected loss experience in domestic management liability, while personal insurance had net favorable development of $7 million pre-tax compared to $36 million of net unfavorable development in the prior year quarter.", "For full year 2017, we had consolidated net favorable development of $592 million pre-tax. As in prior years, I\u2019m providing you with some insight into what our combined 2017 Schedule P is expected to show when filed on May 1. Excluding A&E, on a combined stat Schedule P basis for all of our U.S. subs, all accident years across all product lines in the aggregate developed favorably, and except for commercial auto liability, which developed unfavorably by $87 million pre-tax due to higher than expected bodily injury claims in recent accident years, all product lines across all accident years in the aggregate developed favorably or had de minimis unfavorable development. ", "Page 19 of the webcast sets forth information about our January 1 cat treaty renewal. Our corporate cat aggregate XOL treaty continues to provide coverage for both single cat events and an accumulation of losses from multiple cat events with similar terms as in the prior year, but at a slightly higher cost. The treaty continues to provide $1.5 billion of coverage, part of $2 billion excess of $3 billion after a $100 million deductible per occurrence. It keeps the same broad peril and geographic coverage and the same positioning of the coverage layer, providing a significant buffer between earnings and capital. The treaty has a single limit with no reinstatement provisions, and note that the total cost of this treaty and therefore the slight cost increase are quite small in relation to our core income.", "Fourth quarter operating cash flows, which were impacted by the relatively high level of cat claim payments, were $538 million, bringing total operating cash flow to over $3.7 billion for the year. We ended the year with holding company liquidity of almost $1.3 billion and all of our capital ratios were at or better than their target levels. Net unrealized investment gains were over $1.4 billion pre-tax or $1.1 billion after tax, up from $1.1 billion and $0.7 billion respectively at the beginning of the year, while book value per share of $87.46 and adjusted book value per share of $83.36 increased 5% and 4% respectively from the beginning of the year. ", "Consistent with our ongoing capital management strategy and despite the high level of cat losses, we were able to return $549 million of capital to our shareholders this quarter while maintaining our balance sheet strength through dividends of $198 million and share repurchases of $351 million, bringing total capital return to shareholders to over $2.2 billion in 2017.", "With me, let me turn the microphone over to Brian.", "Brian MacLean", "Thanks Jay. Starting with this quarter\u2019s results in business insurance, segment income was strong at $637 million and the combined ratio for the quarter of 88.6% was flat to the prior year. Income was down from the prior year due primarily to the settlement of a reinsurance dispute in the fourth quarter of 2016. The underlying combined ratio for both the quarter and the full year was about a point higher than 2016. In both cases, the increase was driven by the loss ratio with loss cost trends that modestly exceeded earned pricing, while the full-year variance also reflects an unusually high number of large non-cat fire losses in 2017. The full-year expense ratio of 31.9% was half a point lower than the prior year. As Jay mentioned, the fourth quarter included the impact of some tax-related actions, so the full year is a better indication of our expense run rate.", "Net written premiums of $3.4 billion for the quarter were up about 5% year-over-year with domestic net written premiums up about 4%, driven by continued strong production results in middle market. International net written premiums were up 15% or 11% excluding the impact of the change in foreign currency rates. The growth in international was driven by strong production results in Europe and Canada, along with some normal fluctuations in the Lloyd\u2019s volume.", "Turning to domestic production, we were very pleased with our results in the quarter. Renewal rate change was 1.4% and renewal premium change was 4%, and as Alan said, for both the highest the level in about three years. Retention remained at a historically high level of 85% and new business was strong for the quarter at $478 million, up 16% from the fourth quarter of 2016. ", "Looking at the individual businesses, in select, production remains strong with renewal premium change for the quarter of over 5%, retention of 83%, and new business premiums of $100 million up 11% year-over-year. In middle market, renewal rate change increased to 1.5%, up about a point year-over-year, and renewal premium change increased to 3.6%. Retention remained at a historically high level of 87% while new business premiums of $298 million were up 17% versus the prior year quarter.", "In terms of new business, the technology, tools and process changes we\u2019ve been rolling out over the last several years that we discussed at our recent day have allowed us to be more active in our targeted industry segments. In select, we\u2019re generating more submissions and quotes and having success in closing those incremental opportunities. In middle markets, we\u2019ve been successful in quoting more while also closing more large accounts than a year ago. While the normal volatility in writing large accounts was a factor in this quarter\u2019s growth, we believe our initiatives are beginning to have an impact.", "For the aggregate, production results were very strong, but as we have said many times, the aggregate numbers alone don\u2019t tell the entire story. The detail of where we are getting rate and what accounts we are retaining is key to evaluating the success of our execution, and looking at the results below the headline numbers we couldn\u2019t be more pleased. For example, as you would expect, there was significant line of business texture below the headline production numbers. ", "In terms of pricing, workers compensation, a line that has had strong returns in recent periods, had renewal premium change that was positive but lower than a year ago. Conversely, commercial auto, which is a challenge from a return perspective line, had the highest positive price change in the quarter, well above loss trends. What\u2019s also encouraging to us is that across all the other major product lines - property, GL, C&P, and umbrella, renewal premium change was positive and up both year-over-year and sequentially. Importantly, we were able to achieve these pricing increases while maintaining strong retention and growing new business.", "There was also significant texture based on individual account performance. We continue to be pleased that we are retaining our best performing business, as evidenced by retention rates in excess of 90% for our best performing middle market accounts. In addition, pricing in the quarter improved across the continuum of middle market book, most significantly in our poor performing accounts where we achieved rate increases well in excess of loss trends. Finally, in addition to what we\u2019re seeing in the numbers, we\u2019re also encouraged that there has been some tightening of terms and conditions for catastrophe-exposed risks. ", "So all in, a great quarter and end to the year. We were very pleased with our execution in the marketplace and how we are positioned for continued success in 2018. ", "Before turning to bond and specialty, and I want to comment on our outlook for operating margins, which we include in our quarterly filings. Since our 10-K won\u2019t be filed for a few weeks, I would note that we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017 assuming lower and more normalized levels of non-catastrophe weather-related losses and other loss activity. This is subject to the usual caveats and forward-looking statement disclaimers.", "In bond and specialty insurance, segment income for the quarter was $112 million, down from the prior year quarter due to the international surety charge that Alan mentioned as well as a lower level of net favorable prior year reserve development. In surety, losses are episodic and we remain pleased with the quality of our book. The underlying combined ratio increased from the prior year quarter to 91.1%, reflecting the impact of the surety charge.", "Net written premiums for the quarter were up 5%, reflecting growth in both our domestic surety and management liability businesses. Surety growth was driven by a higher level of large bond activity in the quarter.", "Turning to production in our domestic management liability businesses, we continue to execute our strategy of growing our profitable portfolio by retaining our best performing accounts and writing new business in return adequate product segments, so we couldn\u2019t be more pleased that retention came in at a strong 88% for the quarter while new business was up 17% from the fourth quarter of last year. Renewal premium change of 3.4% was up slightly from the third quarter. Bond and specialty results were solid, and we continue to feel great about our market position.", "In terms of outlook for 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins and the underlying combined ratio for the first nine months of 2018 will be broadly consistent with the same period of 2017. In the last quarter of 2018, we expect that underlying underwriting margins will be higher and the underlying combined ratio will be lower than in the same period of 2017. ", "Turning to personal insurance, net written premiums for the segment grew 8% in the quarter driven by higher pricing primarily in auto and modest PIF growth primarily in homeowners. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were approximately $200 million after tax, above both prior year and our normal expectations, resulting in a $50 million loss for the quarter and a combined ratio of 108.7%. For the full year despite pre-tax cat losses of more than $1 billion, personal insurance generated $128 million of income. The underlying combined ratio in the fourth quarter of 90.4% improved by 3.2 points compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and the full-year underlying combined ratio of 91.5% was about half a point higher than full-year 2016.", "The domestic agency auto combined ratio for the quarter was 103%, including a 1.1 point benefit from catastrophe losses as we reduced our auto estimate related to Hurricane Harvey. The underlying combined ratio of 104.1% improved by 8.1 points from the prior year. As you can see on Page 15 of the webcast, 4.7 points of the decrease is due to last year\u2019s fourth quarter having been elevated as a result of the year-to-date impact of the bodily injury loss re-estimation. The remainder of the improvement is primarily as a result of earned rate from filing actions we have taken over the past year now exceeding loss trends by several points, in line with the planned actions we outlined a year ago. I would remind you that seasonality inflates the absolute value of the fourth quarter combined ratio. ", "As we have continued to take actions to improve profitability in the auto book, renewal premium change increased to 10.6% in the fourth quarter. Retention declined modestly, as expected, given the pricing actions, and PIF growth has leveled out, again in line with our plans. We were pleased with the level of written rate in 2017 and looking ahead, we expect that full-year RPC for 2018 will be broadly consistent with the full-year 2017 result as we look to continue to improve the profitability of the book.", "Turning to agency, homeowners and other, the fourth quarter combined ratio of 115.3% included over 45 points from cat losses, driven by the wildfires in California. The underlying combined ratio of 70.2% for the quarter was consistent with the prior year quarter as higher non-cat weather losses were basically offset by an improvement in the expense ratio. For the full year, the abnormally high cat result of 23.6 points drove the combined ratio up to 100.7%, while the underlying combined ratio of 77.1% was about a point and a half above the prior year due primarily to higher non-cat weather losses.", "Homeowners volume continued to exhibit momentum with healthy PIF growth throughout the year to finish up 5.5% compared to the prior year-end. We\u2019re pleased that our focus on generating growth in this product line has enabled us to steadily increase property PIF count even as we have intentionally slowed the PIF growth in auto. We\u2019re also pleased to have introduced our newest property product, Quantum Home 2.0, in three pilot states during the fourth quarter with initial response from agents and customers in line with our expectations. ", "Overall in personal insurance, while the headlines were all about the significant catastrophe losses, we feel great about having achieved the goals we had established entering 2017. In addition, we continued our ongoing expense discipline, which resulted in slightly lower G&A expenses while delivering 9% growth in net written premiums for the segment, reducing the full year expense ratio by 1.5 points. So for personal insurance in 2017, we were very pleased with the execution on the key elements needed to position this segment for success in 2018.", "Finally as it relates to our outlook for the personal insurance segment as a whole, we expect underlying underwriting margins in 2018 will be higher than in 2017, and the underlying combined ratio will be slightly lower than in 2017. ", "Stepping back to the enterprise, we generated over $2 billion in profits in a year that was dominated by the impact of weather and large losses, so we feel good about the result but, more importantly, feel great about the execution across all our businesses and our market position entering 2018.", "With that, let me turn it back over to Gabby.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Thank you. Before we go to the Q&A portion, Alan has a few additional words.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thanks Gabby. As bittersweet as it is, we have one last piece of business before we open it up for questions. I just want to acknowledge and thank Brian MacLean, who will be retiring at the end of March after a spectacular 30-year career and, after today, something like 53 consecutive earnings calls. He\u2019d never take credit for it, but we owe so much of what we\u2019ve accomplished over so many years to him. He\u2019s been a great colleague to so many and he\u2019s been an important partner and friend to me. Thank you, Brian.", "With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]", "Our first question comes from the line of Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you, good morning. First, congratulations to Brian for three decades at Travelers and best wishes for your retirement. That doesn\u2019t count as a question, so my first question is on pricing. So there is a saturation of BI pricing, and you mentioned that your outlook for 2018 the BIs lower underlying combined ratio, but the 1.4% increase is still lower than the general loss cost trend of 3 to 4%. Just wondering what\u2019s behind the scenes that you expect the pricing to accelerate.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes Kai, good morning, it\u2019s Alan. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s all the things that we talked to you about quarter over quarter in terms of our ability to pull levers and manage profitability, and I\u2019ll remind you that exposure is a piece of that, and that significant portion of exposure contributes to it, but so does selection and mix and the way we segment and the way we price the product claims handling, risk control, expense management. All of those things contribute to our outlook on profitability in the underlying combined ratio.", "Kai Pan", "Okay, then my follow-up is on the tax rate. What\u2019s your overall effective tax rate for the corporation in 2018, and Alan, from your comments it looks like most of the tax benefit will flow through to the bottom line.", "Jay Benet", "This is Jay Benet. The reason I gave you the pieces is that the effective tax rate is always going to be a function of the relationship of the tax-exempt interest to the total interest, so in whatever modeling you\u2019re doing, you need to come up with what you believe the tax exempt interest is going to be, apply a 5.25 tax rate to that, and then everything else that\u2019s U.S. domestic will be at the 21% rate. So the effective tax rate is going to move, but again that\u2019s the way of calculating it.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Kai, just reflecting back on your other question, you were talking about the pricing outlook, and I would just remind you that, as Brian shared with you, that assumes that in BI, the non-cat weather and elevated fire losses, and for that matter in PI, the non-cat weather will both return to normal levels by historical standards. Obviously weather and large losses are going to be what they\u2019re going to be, but the outlook reflects that as well.", "In terms of the benefit from tax reform and what\u2019s going to happen to it, we--as I tried to express in my prepared remarks, it goes into the mix of everything else that we use to generate the prices we need, so yes, I do think that it will fall to the bottom line.", "Kai Pan", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Continuing on, our next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Please proceed.", "Ryan Tunis", "Thanks. Just for Alan, and a follow-up to Kai\u2019s question, just thinking about the fact that last quarter we had a 2018 outlook for broadly consistent margins, and now three months later the outlook is they\u2019ll improve, just wanted to drill down a little further on what it is you\u2019ve seen over the last three months, because I think your outlook on pricing then was also pretty positive. But I guess over the last three months, what\u2019s given you more confidence to really think that margins will be better?", "Alan Schnitzer", "You\u2019ve got to remember that when we talk about underwriting margins, we\u2019re talking about dollars, and combined ratio we\u2019re talking about combined ratio points. That\u2019s a function of the written volume, for example, and everything else that goes into the mix, so it\u2019s a combination of all the things that impact margins and combined ratio. I\u2019m not sure how else to express that.", "Ryan Tunis", "Okay. I guess just on auto, then, I think what you said is you think that RPC will be a similar level to this year as it was last year, and it seemed like this year, it was several points above loss trend. If you could just talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing there, because that sounds like a decent amount of rain. I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s a severity uptick beyond what you expected, or something along those lines. Thanks.", "Michael Klein", "Hey Ryan, it\u2019s Michael Klein. Thanks for the question. The short answer is no, it doesn\u2019t reflect anything beyond what we expected. It\u2019s just the follow-on steps in our existing game plan, and I think when you think about pricing, think of it in three pieces, so the written rate we\u2019re going to achieve in 2018 is partly based on the rate we have already filed in addition to the rate we\u2019ll file in \u201918, and so that drives a lot of our rate outlook. What I think you\u2019ll see as you look ahead to 2018 is RPC in the first half of the year will be higher than the numbers you see on the page from the first half of 2017, and the back half of the year will be lower than the numbers you see for the back half of \u201917. Importantly, on an earned basis since written rate has accelerated through \u201917, earned rate will actually rise in 2018 relative to 2017, so that\u2019s sort of the way that we think about it. But no, the broadly consistent RPC outlook doesn\u2019t reflect anything unanticipated in our loss experience.", "Ryan Tunis", "That\u2019s helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Amit Kumar from Buckingham Research Group. Please proceed.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks and good morning. Maybe just staying on personal auto with Michael Klein, you gave some good color on RPC. How should we think about the PIF growth from here, just based on the fact that a majority of your book is 12 months? When should we see some change in that number down the road?", "Michael Klein", "Thanks Amit, appreciate the question. I think if you think about just the broad themes on auto, what we talked about in 2017, our objective was to improve profitability and manage growth, manage meaning being reduced. As we think about our objective for \u201918, it\u2019s really to try to achieve more balance between growth and profitability in auto, and I think you can certainly see as we talked about last quarter, we felt like we turned the corner on auto profitability in the third quarter. You\u2019re seeing in the year-on-year adjusted underlying combined comparison that improvement accelerating, but again consistent with our RPC outlook, still work to do there. So again, we\u2019re looking to achieve a balance between profitability and growth in \u201918, and then as that profitability continues to improve, we\u2019ll look to resume growth. But right now, we\u2019re trying to level off and then move it forward.", "Amit Kumar", "Thanks, that\u2019s actually helpful. My follow-up, switching back to commercial lines, I know there was some good texture on the pricing change. I\u2019m curious, if we were to step back and think about the active cat quarter for Q3 and Q4 and its impact on the marketplace, would you say that it\u2019s early days for, I guess, a broad-based firming of the small and middle commercial market, or is it more isolated near term?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Amit, it\u2019s Alan. You know, we tried to give you a perspective by line to really address that because putting workers\u2019 comp aside, and that is its own story, the price increases we were able to achieve in the quarter were broader than just the properly lines. As I shared in my prepared remarks, I think the more significant factor driving the pricing is where margins were, certainly for us, and that\u2019s probably true relative to the industry. So you know, I can\u2019t tell you exactly what the industry is going to do or what\u2019s going to happen, but I can tell you what we\u2019re going to do, and that\u2019s to thoughtfully and in close coordination with our agent and broker partners continue to push for rate where we need it to improve the outlook and trend of returns.", "Amit Kumar", "Okay, I\u2019ll stop here. Thanks for the answers.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. ", "Elyse Greenspan", "Hi, thank you. Good morning. My first question, in terms of the margin outlook for business insurance for next year, can you quantify the impact that non-cat weather had this year so we know what to adjust for when thinking about \u201918? In your margin outlook, how are you thinking about the expense ratio versus the loss ratio as we think about you potentially earning in better rate next year?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Hey Elyse, this is Greg Toczydlowski from Business Insurance. In terms of your first question, think about a point in terms of where large losses and non-cat weather are relative to our longer term expectations for 2017, and that would be a good way to think about a going forward perspective. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Elyse, on your question about expenses, we\u2019re going to try to resist the temptation to break out the go-forward perspective on the loss ratio versus the expense ratio. We give you an outlook on the combined ratio, at least qualitatively, because you get into some judgements and a level of precision that is probably further than we\u2019d like to go, at least from an outlook perspective.", "Jay Benet did say in his opening remarks, or maybe it was Brian, that looking at the full year was probably a better perspective on the outlook, and I will add, just following up on our comments at our recent investor day, that productivity and efficiency are important strategic initiatives for us. We\u2019ve seen that benefit of that this year. We\u2019ve got real productivity and efficiency enhancements on the shop floor right now, and we think there\u2019s more to come, and what that does for us, it\u2019s not necessarily that we\u2019re trying to dial in a much lower expense ratio. What we\u2019re trying to do is create all the benefits that come from operating leverage, so we can take those incremental dollars and, as I\u2019ve said before, we can let them fall to the bottom line, we can use it to invest in important strategic capabilities, or we can put it into pricing, and it really is that flexibility that we\u2019re looking for going forward.", "But in terms of the outlook, we\u2019re going to stick with the broader commentary on overall margins.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay. My second question, in terms of the pricing environment, going back to business insurance again, you said in your opening remarks that you want rates to keep pace with inflation. What are you pegging inflation at right now within your commercial lines book, and when you make that comment, I guess that\u2019s what we should compare when we think about the RPC going forward within business insurance? ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes Elyse, we\u2019ve said for a long time that our long-term outlook, and again that\u2019s long-term perspective for all of business insurance, is about 4%, and really no change on that. There\u2019s some texture underneath by line, for example. I\u2019m not sure what your question was about RPC, but rate contributes to margin, and there\u2019s a portion of exposure that\u2019s obviously part of RPC that also contributes to it, so I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s the texture and color you were looking for.", "Elyse Greenspan", "I guess what I was thinking about was your RPC was about 4% in the quarter, and then you were saying that inflation was about 4%, but then to your commentary it seems like you are pushing for more price across your book of business from where we were at in the fourth quarter, so I was just trying to tie those two comments together. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "Yes, so Elyse, I would say think of RPC as having two components - one, pure rate, and two, exposure. Of the piece that\u2019s exposure, a portion of that behaves like margin and there\u2019s a portion of it that has real loss content in it and doesn\u2019t. So you know, RPC needs to be above the overall loss trend in order for us to consider margins to be expanding, and you could look at those numbers and you\u2019d say, at least on a written basis, we\u2019re getting close. Although, we do think--I do think over time that insurance like most other businesses, pricing ought to keep up with inflation, but I would say that given where we are now and in terms of the outlook and trend for returns, we\u2019re looking to do a little bit better than just offset inflation, were looking to expand margin.", "Elyse Greenspan", "Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed.", "Yaron Kinar", "Good morning everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is with regards to the rate increases in business insurance. If I strip out commercial auto, I think if my calculation is correct, I get to roughly flat rate for the rest of the business. Am I thinking about that correctly, or are there maybe areas or lines where you are getting more rates outside of commercial auto?", "Jay Benet", "Yes Yaron, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re doing the math entirely correctly. There\u2019s a lot of different pieces underneath the net written premium change, which I think you\u2019re trying to back into, so we\u2019re certainly, as Alan said earlier, very much focused on where some of the more distressed lines are - automobile and the catastrophic exposed areas of property, but we\u2019re also pushing ahead on all the products, so the math doesn\u2019t come out where we\u2019re flat on all the other product lines.", "Alan Schnitzer", "I would just direct you back to Brian\u2019s comments where he gave you a view of pricing by line, so price is positive in every line outside of workers\u2019 comp, higher both sequentially and year-over-year. We can follow up with you and walk you through the math if that\u2019s helpful.", "Yaron Kinar", "Yes, we\u2019ll do that. Then one other question on tax reform. Alan, if I understand your comments correct, basically you\u2019re looking at the results of--you\u2019re targeting a certain return, and tax reform ends up helping that return. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of are you expecting any change in investment allocation that would further boost or decrease the impact of tax reform?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Let me turn that over to Bill Heyman and ask him to respond to that.", "Bill Heyman", "I think it was possible there will be over time some reallocation. The elimination of corporate AMT removed a ceiling in terms of the amount of municipals we can own, although that\u2019s very theoretical. Every day we look at what the market throws up in terms of assuming roughly equal credit quality, which is rarely the case, where is the highest after-tax return. I think going forward, that will more often in certain segments of the curve be in taxables rather than municipals. It may even be that we buy taxables and sell municipals in certain parts of the curve, and the reason for that is for the first time I can remember, individual investors and corporate investors have very different utility functions, so at many parts of the curve your municipal is not worth as much to us as it used to be, but it\u2019s worth more to an individual investor than it is to us. So there may be opportunities to pick up after-tax yield on advantageous terms, but obviously we can\u2019t guarantee them or quantify them. But I suspect if you looked at the portfolio three years now, the mix would have changed.", "Yaron Kinar", "Thank you very much. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. ", "Paul Newsome ", "I wanted to ask whether or not the outlook for M&A for Travelers has changed with tax reform. Does it make it easier or more interesting to buy something outside the U.S. for Travelers?", "Alan Schnitzer", "Good morning, Paul. What I can tell you is that tax reform for us and others who are similarly situated obviously just makes us a more competitive buyer relative to a non-U.S. taxpayer who previously had the benefit of some structural advantages, structural tax advantages. Those advantages have gone away, so that levels the playing field, so relatively speaking we\u2019re a more competitive buyer, so that\u2019s changed for sure.", "What hasn\u2019t changed, Paul, is either our lens or our propensity to do transactions, and by that I mean we are always looking for opportunities, both organic and inorganic, and when we can make them happen on terms that are attractive to us, we\u2019re going to try hard to do that. As I\u2019ve said before and just to reiterate it, we\u2019re going to try to do deals when it improves our return profile, lowers our volatility, or provides us with other important strategic benefits, so maybe our positioning relative to others changes but our lens or propensity doesn\u2019t.", "The other thing that won\u2019t change is our capital management strategy. We will continue to think about and allocate capital the same way we have historically. I guess given tax reform and all other things being equal, there\u2019s probably higher earnings and capital to put to through that capital management filter, but our thought process around capital management doesn\u2019t change.", "Paul Newsome", "That\u2019s it for me, thanks. Congrats on the quarter.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thanks Paul.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please proceed.", "Jay Gelb", "Thank you. My first question is on capital deployment in 2018. Should we still consider 100% of operating earnings as being deployable for share buybacks and dividends, absent another opportunity emerging?", "Jay Benet", "Hi Jay, it\u2019s Jay. As Alan just said, the way we think about capital management hasn\u2019t changed, so we\u2019re always going to try to fund growth, we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to create shareholder value, and to the extent that we continue to create excess capital, we\u2019ll manage it the same way - returning it to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and the driver of that is the earnings of the play. So no change there, and what we\u2019ve said in the 10-K and the 10-Q all along with regard to that still holds.", "Jay Gelb", "I appreciate that. Then if I can try one on tax, using your supplement, if I look at the tax-free municipal income and apply the rate you mentioned, I guess I get kind of driven down to a 15.5 to 16% overall effective tax rate. Am I in the neighborhood on that? ", "Jay Benet", "If the calculation you\u2019re doing is looking at the supplement, taking some view as to what the average asset base would be for the munis, applying the rate that we show in the supplement as the earnings rate on that, you\u2019ll get the pre-tax muni NII, apply 5.25% to that, and you\u2019ll have that component of the tax accrual, and then the rest, whatever you\u2019re assuming with regard to the non-muni income, not just NII but underwriting, apply the 21% to and you\u2019ll get an effective tax rate.", "Jay Gelb", "Okay, thanks Jay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next call is a question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jay Cohen", "Thank you - back-to-back Jays. A couple of questions. First is the surety premiums went up. You said there was more activity. Do you see this being a function of the economy, and should we expect the top line on the surety side to possibly expand, especially if we\u2019ve got more infrastructure spending?", "Tom Kunkel", "Jay, this is Tom Kunkel, good morning. I think the way we\u2019re looking at the surety production in the month is it really can be episodic, and those are some very well performing businesses and accounts that we were doing that volume with but I wouldn\u2019t say that we in any way view it as indicative as an increase in activity for the type of work that drives surety bonding. So as they say, a little lumpy.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it. Other question, on the commercial lines market, your effort to raise prices a bit more aggressively has been met with a retention that has stayed at a historically high level. It suggests the rest of the market is coming along as well, and I\u2019m wondering if you could speak qualitatively about what you\u2019re hearing from agents and brokers regarding how your competitors are responding to the same pressures that you are.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Jay, it\u2019s Alan. We don\u2019t talk a lot to our distribution partners about the way our competitors price. It\u2019s a competitive marketplace, and they do what they do and we do what we do. I will tell you that just in terms of our process, we do a lot of work and we\u2019ve got a lot of talent out there in the field, and our underwriters are out talking to our distribution partners about accounts 90, 120 days out to make sure that we\u2019re working in partnership with them and making sure that we\u2019re sharing with our customers why we\u2019re doing what we\u2019re doing. So you know, we\u2019ve got, I think just a tremendous field organization and I think they\u2019ve done a great job.", "Obviously we do operate in a competitive marketplace, and so I do think that what you see in our results is to some degree a reflection of the market. I\u2019ve always thought that there are probably two reasons that maybe we have a little bit of incremental pricing power. One is just the franchise value we bring to the marketplace in product breadth and risk control and claims--an unbelievable claims organization, and I think that our agent and broker partners are proud to sell that and I think our customers see value in it. ", "The other advantage I think we have to some degree is data analytics. It\u2019s about risk selection and pricing, and we\u2019ve been a pioneer for a long time in not just data analytics but delivering that data and analytics to the screen of the local underwriter at the point of sale. So I do think those two things probably give us a little bit of an advantage, but certainly there is a marketplace dynamic to what we\u2019re able to achieve.", "Jay Cohen", "Got it, thanks Alan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Please proceed.", "Brian Meredith", "Yes, thanks. Two quick questions here for you. The first one, I\u2019m just curious, could we parse a little bit business insurance as far as what\u2019s going on from a rate perspective? I\u2019m just curious, when small commercial, not a lot of rate, it just doesn\u2019t need it, more competitive pressures, and also on your large ticket property business, that\u2019s one that you had excluded a while from your rate calculations because it\u2019s so competitive, how is that trending now and maybe relative to your expectations? And then I have one follow-up.", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Brian, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start with the small commercial one. We\u2019ve been focusing on the small commercial business for a number of years now, really trying to get the margins to a place where we feel very comfortable with them, and we are very much within our target thresholds of where we want to be from a small commercial, so we\u2019ve had a deliberate set of execution around our rate plan there, so that\u2019s the first element around why you see a smaller level of rate in small than middle.", "The second one really is around our express business, which think of it as the straight through processing of small commercial, really has a more prescriptive flat rating environment, and so when we see some of the pressures of rate reductions in workers\u2019 comp given the extraordinarily profitability on that line over time, we see that more immediately impact that business. Those are the two reasons that are driving the small commercial.", "Brian Meredith", "And on the property, large account property? ", "Greg Toczydlowski", "What was your question on the large property?", "Brian Meredith", "How is that--the large account property, how is that playing out from a rate perspective right now? Is it getting the rate that you kind of need in that area, or not?", "Greg Toczydlowski", "Given the hurricanes were in the third quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our agility one quarter in, in terms of what we\u2019ve been trying to do on the national property side. As Alan said, we think franchise value matters, and we\u2019re seeing that inside our numbers where we\u2019ve been able to push thoughtfully and, at the same time, retain the book of business.", "Jay Benet", "Brian, just one comment on top of that. Looking back over significant cat events over the years, the impact in the large property book on rate is usually two, three, even sometimes four quarters out, the peak of that, so we\u2019re optimistic that there could be more to come, but that\u2019s just looking at the historical trends. ", "Alan Schnitzer", "And we made good progress in the quarter.", "Jay Benet", "Yes.", "Brian Meredith", "Great, and then just on personal lines, and just on tax, I appreciate the comments on how it\u2019s going to fall to the bottom line, but I guess my question more on the personal line space is as you look out, understanding you need more rate to get to the right returns that you really want in that business, but should we expect that kind of your combined ratios, where you\u2019d like them to get, are going to be higher here going forward as a result of tax, and specifically related to at least certain states have return on capital type benchmarks that they look at, is there going to be pushback from those regulators on returns here with tax reform?", "Michael Klein", "Brian, it\u2019s Michael. Thanks for the question. I would say where you started is probably where we start, which is we\u2019re not at target returns yet and we\u2019ve got work to do. I think consistent with Alan\u2019s comments in the opening, a lower tax rate sort of helps move us closer but doesn\u2019t get us all the way there, so when you think about it from a filed rate and a regulatory standpoint, we certainly see and actually have seen just this week news from some regulators on the fact that they are thinking about the tax rate and looking to apply it in some of those conversations, but generally speaking it doesn\u2019t change the direction we need to move rates, particularly in auto. We still have work to do there to get to target returns, and we\u2019re going to continue down that path.", "Brian Meredith", "Right, it\u2019s just the magnitude you need going forward is probably less today than it would have been before tax reform?", "Michael Klein", "I would say all else being equal, but again to Alan\u2019s point earlier, you\u2019ve got expenses, you\u2019ve got loss experience, you\u2019ve got investment yield, a whole bunch of things that go into that mix, and it\u2019s just one factor that we need to consider.", "Brian Meredith", "Great, thanks for the answer. ", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with Keefe, Bruyette and & Woods. Please proceed.", "Meyer Shields", "Thanks. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m over-thinking this, but I guess I was surprised that the outlook for 2018 for personal insurance was only a slightly lower combined ratio with auto earned rates likely to approach double digits. Am I missing something there?", "Michael Klein", "Meyer, this is Michael. Thanks for the question, and appreciate it because Brian did give you the overall outlook for the segment, but there\u2019s a little bit of texture underneath. So if you think about auto specifically when you see the 10-K outlook, what you\u2019re going to see is our commentary there is for improved margins and combined ratio. The home outlook, on the other hand, is broadly consistent both from a margin and a combined ratio standpoint, assuming more normalized levels of non-cat weather activity. When you put those two pieces together, you get improved margins and a slightly improved combined ratio in the aggregate.", "Part of that, I guess the other factor is as auto premium is growing more than home, and auto carries a higher combined ratio, mix impacts the adjustment in the combined ratio. ", "Meyer Shields", "Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Second, I guess this is a broader question. You\u2019ve talked a lot in the past about how some elements of exposure act like rate. Are those elements more, I guess, reflective of the price of the exposure to the values that are being insured, or of exposure unit growth or on a real basis?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I\u2019m not totally sure I understand the question, but I think it\u2019s more of a value than it is unit, right? You increase the value of a unit and it\u2019s that increase in exposure that behaves more like rate. When you actually add another unit of exposure, you have another unit of loss content, so I think that\u2019s the right way to think about it.", "Meyer Shields", "Okay, perfect. That\u2019s exactly what I was asking.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sarah Dewitt with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Sarah Dewitt", "Hey, good morning. Wanted to try one more on the tax rate. What would the pro forma tax rate have been this year under U.S. tax reform?", "Jay Benet", "Actually, it\u2019s not something we actually calculated, so I think we would suggest you do the same thing - just look at what the NII was for the tax exempt portfolio and then for everything else, apply the 21% rate. But we haven\u2019t done the calculation.", "Sarah Dewitt", "Okay. Yes, I\u2019m coming up with some slightly different numbers than in the previous question, so just--I mean, if you were willing to disclose that, I think that would be helpful.", "Jay Benet", "Well just to add, the information is in the supplement, so maybe it\u2019s something Gabby can follow up with you on.", "Sarah Dewitt", "Okay, great. Thank you. Then secondly, just on the auto insurance underlying combined ratio, it improved nicely this quarter but it\u2019s still above 100. How long should we be thinking about it will take to get below 100, given some of the pricing actions you\u2019re taking offset by the new business penalty?", "Michael Klein", "Thanks Sarah, it\u2019s Michael. I want to just put a point on Brian\u2019s comment earlier about reflecting seasonality to start with. So if you\u2019re looking at Page 15 and you\u2019re looking at the 101 for the full year versus the 104 for the quarter, that is pretty consistent with the seasonality we would typically see in the quarter. In terms of how long it takes, I think we\u2019re certainly optimistic, and as we said last quarter, we feel good about the progress we\u2019re making towards our target combined ratio and see that continuing as we look ahead into \u201918 and \u201919. ", "I think with the outlook that we\u2019ve given you for RPC, you can sort of make your own estimate of what the earned rate will be, apply a loss trend and get to an earned combined ratio pretty quickly, and I guess at this point as we look at our experience, we don\u2019t see anything that would cause us to tell you to do it any differently. ", "Sarah Dewitt", "Okay, great.", "Jay Benet", "Just as a follow-up to your tax question, in terms of the going forward approach to calculating an effective tax rate, what I said is absolutely on point - there is a little bit of foreign income that\u2019s taxed at a slightly different rate, but that shouldn\u2019t matter. That will matter more this year than in the future because of today\u2019s 35% tax rate versus the future. ", "But one of the other things that we should point out, and you\u2019ll see it in the press release, we did have a favorable tax settlement earlier in the year that would have affected this year\u2019s effective tax rate, so if you\u2019re going to a pro forma for this year, you have to take that into account. Then in addition to that, I mentioned in my commentary that we did some tax planning initiatives in the year that had some impact on the effective tax rate as well, so really the calculation you want to do is not about this year, it\u2019s about going forward.", "Sarah Dewitt", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Okay, this will be our last question, please.", "Operator", "Certainly. Our final question comes from the line of Larry Greenberg with Janney Montgomery Scott. Please proceed.", "Larry Greenberg", "Thank you. If you can believe it, I still have a question to ask. So going back to tax reform and the level playing field, aside from the benefits that might be there on the M&A side, from an operating standpoint or from a business line standpoint, where do you think the most concrete benefits might arise given the more level playing field?", "Alan Schnitzer", "You know, I guess the way we think about that is the tax line is an expense line like any other expense line that we work into our pricing models, and to the extent that we\u2019ve got a level playing field and aren\u2019t at a disadvantage in that regard, I think again on a relative basis from a pricing perspective, that helps. I would say after M&A, and maybe even before M&A, that that\u2019s a significant factor in terms of a level playing field.", "Larry Greenberg", "But in terms of business insurance, specific lines, there is none that necessarily jump out more than others? ", "Alan Schnitzer", "I think the same math applies to all of our pricing models for all of our products, so I don\u2019t think I would make a distinction there. ", "Larry Greenberg", "Okay. Then just with better economic growth perhaps on the horizon, do you think that all things equal, small commercial premium growth should maybe catch up to the middle market and maybe even grow faster in an improving economic environment?", "Alan Schnitzer", "I\u2019m not really sure how to answer that question. I do think across all of our businesses, we\u2019re pretty well leveraged and pretty well positioned to benefit from an improving economic environment. In terms of--you know, if you\u2019re asking about growth in GDP by small enterprise versus large, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve got a better view on that than you or anyone else. If you\u2019re talking about our own market position, small versus large, there\u2019s so many things that go into growth and we actually don\u2019t think about it that way. We execute, as you\u2019ve heard us say many times, at a very granular level, so whether it\u2019s small or large, we\u2019re trying to keep our best business, improve the profitability on the business where we need to, and do a lot of hustle in leveraging our competitive advantages, trying to generate new business. When that very granular strategy adds up to growth, we grow, so that\u2019s the way I think about it and we don\u2019t really think about the small differently than the large from that perspective.", "Larry Greenberg", "Great, thanks.", "Alan Schnitzer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the presentation back to Ms. Nawi. Please proceed.", "Gabriella Nawi", "Excellent.
