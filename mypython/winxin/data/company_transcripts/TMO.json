All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until August 4, 2017. A copy of the press release of our second quarter 2017 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q2 call.", "I'm pleased to report that we had another excellent quarter. Our team executed very well to deliver great financial performance. We made terrific progress in advancing our growth strategy, launching new high-impact products, and achieving strong results in emerging markets. And we continued to effectively deploy our capital, announcing our acquisition of Patheon, which will further strengthen our customer value proposition. Our performance in Q2 contributed to a strong first half, and we're right on track to deliver another great year. I'll cover these highlights in more detail during my remarks, starting with our financial results.", "First, we delivered another excellent quarter of adjusted EPS growth, with a 13% increase to $2.30 per share. As you know, we have a long track record of consistently delivering strong EPS performance, and we continued that trend in Q2. Our revenue in Q2 grew 10% year over year. Our adjusted operating income increased 13%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 23.3%.", "Our margin expansion reflects the continuous impact of our PPI [Practical Process Improvement] Business System, which is our foundation for operational discipline across the company. PPI creates competitive advantage for Thermo Fisher Scientific by increasing productivity and quality, which ultimately results in stronger customer allegiance. Our PPI Business System is a key driver of profitable growth and is a great playbook for optimizing our existing businesses as well as integrating acquisitions.", "To summarize the financial results, we achieved another great quarter that led to a strong first half, which puts us where we need to be at the midpoint of the year.", "Let me give you some color on our performance relative to our end markets. They played out as we expected and in line with our full-year guidance. Pharma and biotech continued to be our strongest end market, with growth in the mid-single digits in Q2. We continue to leverage our unique value proposition with these customers and saw strong performance across our biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, as well as our research and safety market channel.", "Turning to industrial and applied, we grew here at about the company average in Q2. Similar to last quarter, we saw good demand in our research and safety market channel from industrial customers. And we were encouraged to see a return to growth in our chemical analysis business in the quarter. Applied markets, particularly environmental and food safety, remained strong, as they have for quite some time.", "In our other two end markets, academic and government and diagnostics and healthcare, conditions were similar in Q2 to what we've been seeing for a number of quarters. We grew in the low single digits in both of these end markets.", "Now let me turn to some of our many business highlights we had in the quarter. As usual, I'll put them in the framework of our growth strategy, which is centered on developing high-impact innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, and delivering our unique value proposition to our customers.", "So, starting with innovation, as you will recall, we began the year strong and we increased our momentum in Q2 with a number of significant developments. Let me give you a few examples from the quarter.", "First, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry is always a great opportunity for us to reinforce our leadership, and we proudly celebrated our 50th anniversary in mass spectrometry this year. The progress we continue to make was very evident at ASMS, and I'll mention a couple of the highlights. For life science researchers, we continued to build our leading Orbitrap platform, raising the bar in both accuracy and speed to accelerate results from proteomics. The newly launched Q Exactive HF-X system was designed to improve analysis of complex biological samples in translational research and biopharma applications.", "For customers in applied markets, we launched two new Triple Stage Quadrupole systems that improve quantitative workflows in clinical research and forensic toxicology. For example, in our genetic analysis business, we introduced the new SeqStudio Genetic Analyzer. This is a simple to operate, affordable, and cloud-enabled system for customers working in low or mid-throughput genetic laboratories. This launch builds on our leading position across the genetic analysis workflow.", "Turning to diagnostics, we're very pleased to receive clearance from the U.S. FDA for two important tests that give clinicians the information they need to make better decisions for their patients. First, in a significant development, we were granted pre-market approval for the first companion diagnostic test using next-gen sequencing to screen for non-small-cell lung cancer. Our Oncomine Dx Target Test can simultaneously evaluate 23 genes associated with this disease and identify patients who may be a match for certain treatments. We developed the test in partnership with Novartis and Pfizer, and the goal is to expand its use beyond lung cancer in the future. This is an important milestone in our companywide effort to advance precision medicine and is a great example of the unique capabilities we have to support this global initiative.", "We also received 510(k) clearance to expand the use of our B.R.A.H.M.S. PCT-sensitive KRYPTOR assay to aid in antibiotic therapy decision-making. What this means is that the assay can help doctors decide when to administer antibiotics to patients with lower respiratory tract infections, or when to safely discontinue antibiotics in those patients. As a specific biomarker for bacterial infection, our PCT test is an effective tool for addressing the challenge of antibiotic resistance.", "The second element of our growth strategy is to leverage our scale in APAC and emerging markets. The headline here is that we delivered another strong quarter, with both China and India delivering double-digit growth. It's clear that our scale is an important competitive advantage for us, particularly in these regions.", "We continue to increase our presence in emerging markets, and our teams are effectively leveraging those investments to drive growth. A good example from the quarter comes from the Middle East, where we strengthened our long-term relationship with the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, better known as KAUST. We participated in the opening of the KAUST Center of Excellence for Electron Microscopy, which is a technology we added through our acquisition of FEI. The KAUST collaboration is intended to accelerate research by bringing these highly sophisticated tools to local scientists and industries for applications ranging from nanoparticles to life sciences.", "I'll also add that our electron microscopy business had strong performance again in Q2. As we approach the anniversary of the FEI acquisition in late September, the integration continues to go very smoothly. We're running ahead of our year one accretion targets, and that's driven by the combination of strong growth and synergies. Longer term, we're on track to deliver our year three synergy targets, and we're beginning to tap the many opportunities we have with FEI to create tremendous value for our customers.", "That's a good transition to the third element of our growth strategy, which is our customer value proposition. Our agreement to acquire Patheon is the latest example of the significant investments we continue to make to enhance our offering for our customers. We're really excited about the new outsourcing services we'll gain from Patheon, which will allow us to provide comprehensive support for our biopharma customers, from drug development to clinical trials to commercial manufacturing. When I talk to these customers, the feedback has been very positive, and they're eager to explore new opportunities to expand our partnerships.", "Here's a quick update on the progress we're making as we work towards the close. The integration teams from both companies are well into the planning phase so we can hit the ground running at the time of close. I've been very impressed by the state-of-the-art facilities I've seen and the world-class team I've met during the integration process.", "We've begun to put financing in place and we're moving through the regulatory process. We're very confident in our ability to close by the end of the year, and look forward to officially welcoming our new Patheon colleagues to Thermo Fisher. Including Patheon, we will have deployed approximately $8.5 billion of capital in 2017. Our successful capital deployment strategy gives us the ability to create significant shareholder value through a combination of strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends.", "Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. Stephen will cover the detail. But at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $19.71 billion to $19.89 billion, which will result in 8% to 9% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising it to a new range of $9.15 to $9.28 for 2017, for 11% to 12% growth over 2016.", "Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q2. We delivered an excellent quarter, which contributed to a strong first half. We're successfully executing our growth strategy to create long-term value for our customers and shareholders. We're right on track at the midpoint of the year, and that positions us to achieve an excellent 2017.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our second quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four business segments and conclude with our updated 2017 guidance.", "Before I get into the details, let me start with a high-level view of how the second quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered 4% organic growth in Q2, and that was in line with our expectations for the quarter.", "FX came in about $50 million less of a headwind on revenue than we had expected, but was $0.01 more of a headwind on adjusted EPS due to transactional and non-operating FX losses in the quarter. However, despite the additional FX headwind on adjusted EPS, we were still able to finish $0.04 higher in Q2 than we had assumed at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This is due to excellent operational performance across the company, including strong volume and pull-through from our FEI electron microscopy business, so another quarter of very strong execution.", "Now let me give you more color on Q2. Starting with our total company financial performance, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q2 by 13%, to $2.30. GAAP EPS was $1.56, up 20% from Q2 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year over year. The components of our Q2 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange.", "Looking at our growth by geography in Q2, North America grew about the company average and Europe grew in the low single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits, including mid-teens growth in China, and rest of the world was flat this quarter.", "Turning to our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 23.3%, up 50 basis points from Q2 of last year. This 50 basis points of expansion was a result of good pull-through from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI Business System and volume leverage. This was partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and foreign exchange.", "Adjusted gross margin came in at 48.3% in Q2. This represents a contraction of 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by business mix and foreign exchange, partially offset by strong contributions from our PPI Business System.", "Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 20.6% of revenue, which is 120 basis points favorable to Q2 2016, primarily driven by business mix and the impact of acquisitions.", "R&D expense came in at 4.4% of revenue, up 40 basis points versus Q2 last year. R&D as a percent of manufacturing revenue increased to 6.7%. This is 50 basis points higher than Q2 2016, primarily due to the impact of FEI's more significant R&D spend.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $116 million, up $10 million from Q2 2016. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $7 million, which is $13 million unfavorable versus Q2 2016, which was driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 40 basis points lower than last year and right in line with our expectations for the quarter.", "The average diluted shares were 393.3 million, down 3.4 million year over year, mainly as a result of share buybacks, partially offset by option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $1.21 billion, and free cash flow was $1.03 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $180 million. We ended the quarter with $615 million in cash and investments. During Q2, we completed $250 million of share buybacks and paid $60 million in dividends. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $16.8 billion, down $300 million sequentially from Q1, and our leverage ratio at the end of quarter was 3.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, down from 3.6 times at the end of Q1.", "And wrapping up comments on our total company performance, we continued to see good year-over-year improvement in ROIC, even net of the impact of recent acquisitions. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q2 was 10%, up 20 basis points over Q2 2016.", "Now let me provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue and organic revenue both increased 3% in Q2. In the quarter, our biosciences business delivered particularly strong growth. Q2 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 15%, and adjusted operating margin was up 340 basis points year over year to 31.9%. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity and volume pull-through, partially offset by business mix, strategic investments, and the dilutive impact of acquisitions.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes our new FEI electron microscopy business, reported revenue increased 47% in Q2 and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in chromatography and in the mass spec business. And it was encouraging to see the chemical analysis business return to positive growth, as Marc mentioned earlier. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 61%, and adjusted operating margin was 20%, up 170 basis points year over year. In the quarter, we continued to see a positive impact from the electron microscopy business as well as strong volume leverage and productivity. This was partially offset by FX and strategic investments.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q2 total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue growth was 2%. Our transplant diagnostics business delivered particularly strong growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income decreased 1% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.3%, which represents a contraction of 60 basis points from Q2 of the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity, but this was more than offset by strategic investments and business mix.", "Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue increased 4% and organic revenue growth was 5%. In the quarter, our channel business delivered particularly strong growth. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 13.8%, down 130 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from both productivity and volume leverage. However, as expected, this was more than offset by the impact of the unfavorable business mix, driven by our biopharma services business, which was impacted by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 clinical trial last year, as we mentioned last quarter.", "With that, I'll now move on to our full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we are raising our guidance. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth for full-year 2017. The midpoint of our revenue guidance is increasing $190 million. Of that increase, $160 million reflects a less adverse foreign exchange environment, and $30 million reflects the improvement in the outlook from our FEI acquisition.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, there were two key changes to our guidance. First, we're increasing the midpoint of our guidance by $0.065 to reflect our strong Q2 operational performance and a less adverse FX environment for the year.", "And second, as you may have seen, we've started the process of securing permanent financing for the Patheon acquisition, and last week we completed a $3 billion European bond offering. For 2017, the interest on this new debt will equate to approximately $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share, and we factored this into our revised guidance. As is our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and therefore it does not include Patheon or any related future financing activities.", "And finally, with another quarter of great performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range by $180 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range by $0.13. Summing this all up, the increased 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $19.71 billion to $19.89 billion, which would represent 8% to 9% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just under 5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and foreign exchange is expected to be a headwind of $90 million or 0.5%, and as I mentioned previously, 4% organic growth.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.15 to $9.28, with a midpoint of $9.215. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2016. We now expect a headwind from foreign exchange of $0.15 or just under 2%. That is $0.02 less of a headwind than our previous guidance. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%.", "A few other details behind our revised 2017 guidance, we now expect 50 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year over year compared to the 40 to 60 basis points in our previous guidance. Foreign exchange is now a 10 basis point headwind for the year compared to a net neutral in our previous guidance. However, this is being more than offset by the strong operational performance. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $480 million and other income and expense to be a net expense of $12 million. We continue to forecast our adjusted income tax rate to be 13.3% for the year.", "We've completed $750 million of share buybacks this year. And given the pending acquisition of Patheon, at this point we do not expect any additional buybacks in 2017. We continue to assume we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in 2017, and full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 393 million to 394 million, consistent with our previous guidance.", "We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million, no change from the previous guidance. And we continue to expect about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for full-year 2017.", "And finally, in terms of phasing, we're expecting organic growth to be relatively even over the remainder of the year. For adjusted earnings per share, we expect that it will be phased across the remaining six months of the year in a similar way to the same period in 2016. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out.", "So in summary, we delivered another strong quarter in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point to achieve our full-year 2017 financial goals.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Stephen. Dan, we're ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question today comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "So, Marc, the company has had a remarkable ability to identify assets before inflections in their business. Obviously, it happened with Life Tech, and now we're seeing it with FEI. I count the core growth there was north of 20%, so that business is seemingly on fire. I guess as we think about that, and then eventually Patheon rolling into the organic over time, what would it take, from an end market perspective, or what mix or shift of businesses would have to happen for organic growth not to ultimately accelerate from here?", "And I guess, as you look at the end markets as they trended over the balance of the quarter, what if anything should we keep in mind as an offset to this? Because it seems like, versus where we were several years ago, the business is poised to now be at the upper end of the peer group from a core growth perspective.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Ross, thanks for the question. I guess, a few thoughts. One is, the FEI acquisition is performing very well. The integration is an intensive effort, and the team really has not been distracted, so they're doing a good job of integrating the business, but they're also delivering good growth and good bookings. And that's a testament to the strength of the team and the proven integration processes we have, so that's obviously a positive.", "As I look towards the end markets just broadly in terms of growth, at a high level, we finished the first half up 4%. Each quarter was 4%. We maintained our guidance at 4% for the year. Obviously, we're going to strive to drive to the best possible performance.", "If I'd say what are the catalysts from here in terms of stronger momentum as you think about 2018 and beyond, or even second half and beyond, it's going to be, let's get a U.S. government budget in place for 2018. It was good to get the 2017 budget. It was good to see NIH funding increased. We'll continue to educate Congress, but I feel good about that process. So if we can get \u2013 skip a continuing resolution, get a budget in place, that would clearly continue some momentum in academic. And then, at least from our own perspective, we don't really wait for the end markets; it's the actions we take. So we have a lot of effort around product development that put us in a position to be in the higher ends of our growth targets. So that's how I would think about it, Ross, at a high level.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "And maybe just on the pharma end market, you gave a few points that were helpful. As you think about the pacing there and what we've seen in different sub-segments of that market, I know I think coming into the year, you guys had talked about growth rates consistent with what we've seen, or maybe they've been slightly better. But how are you thinking about the exit velocity of that business out of the quarter, or that segment, and then some of the moving parts there, in terms of how that's likely to trend?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Ross, let me give you a relatively comprehensive view on pharma and biotech. I know it's an area of interest. First is, pharma and biotech is our strongest end market. We performed very well in the quarter. We grew a couple points higher than the company average serving that market.", "In terms of what drove that growth, first, as I mentioned last quarter, our clinical trials business was impacted by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 study, and that headwind will sunset in Q4. Bioproduction growth was a bit more muted this quarter, and you've seen that across the industry. The super important point to highlight is that our business is serving the research customers. Biosciences, chromatography and mass spectrometry, and the channel, they all grew incredibly strongly in the quarter. So it was another great quarter for us, and our value proposition continues to resonate very well with the customer base.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "That's helpful, thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Marc, maybe I want to pick up on that last point on the Life Sciences Solutions. It was the slowest growth we've seen in a little while for that segment. Can you maybe just talk on your outlook there, and some of the comments you've previously made on bioprocess being a little bit softer?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Sure, Tycho, thanks for the question. So, when you look at Life Sciences Solutions, we had 7% growth in Q1, 3% growth in Q2, 5% average for the first half. I would focus on the 5% average. And when you look at \u2013 Easter played a little bit of an effect with a little bit of a benefit in Q1, obviously a little bit of a headwind in Q2. And when I look at the outlook for the business, it looks good.", "When you get into the details of why was growth a little bit slower, particularly in Q2, holding aside timing and those things, bioproduction was a little bit more in line with where the industry was growing in this particular quarter, and the biosciences business continues to do very well. So that's really the factors from Life Sciences Solutions.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then following up on the FEI question, how much of the inflection we're seeing now is on the Cryo-EM side versus the semi cycle picking up for that business?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So when you look at the performance of the Cryo-EM, that continues to go extremely well, with strong growth in revenue and strong growth in bookings. The material science business, which includes basically everything else, semiconductor and all the other applications for electron microscopy, clearly is continuing to be very strong. And you're seeing the benefit of a strong pipeline in semiconductor as well as good performance in material science applications elsewhere. So that business is performing at a very strong level.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, and then just last one on capital deployment. With the equity issuance component to the Patheon deal, it seems like the door is still open to attempt to do another acquisition in the near to intermediate term. Can you maybe just talk on your appetite and willingness to do another deal?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "From our perspective, our number one priority is to run the businesses that we have and run them very well. And we're excited about our portfolio, and we're looking forward to closing Patheon and successfully integrating that and creating value for our customers and our shareholders.", "We continue to have an active pipeline of smaller bolt-on transactions, and we'll continue to look at those transactions. And should the right ones make sense, you will continue to see us do a modest level of M&A from that perspective.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. The Specialty Diagnostics businesses for the second quarter in a row has been a little bit below what we had calculated. And I think we're trying to fathom that, given that the patient visit data looks pretty decent from IMS and some of the other ones. Can you talk us through what's going on in the Specialty Diagnostics business? And is there something going on from a healthcare perspective? Are people worried about healthcare reform or something like that? Can you walk us through \u2013 are people not buying or worried about how many people are not buying instruments or things like that that is potentially slowing the market down?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Derik, it's a very good question, so let's delve into Specialty Diagnostics a little bit. It was low single-digit growth in the quarter, consistent with what we've seen over the last few quarters. The two businesses that had very strong growth were our biomarker business and our transplant diagnostic business, and every other business in that portfolio was stable and all grew modestly. So if you look at it from a product range perspective, two really strong growing businesses and then the rest of the portfolio stable and modest growth.", "When you look at geographically, really it was Europe that was not robust. North America is fine. And when you look at the activity, it seems that there are many bright spots in Europe, but it seems that healthcare was relatively modest from that perspective. So I wouldn't be reading too much into the ACA and PAMA and those things. That's not really been a big factor.", "We are taking a number of actions to strengthen the growth prospects of that business. Obviously, our Specialty Diagnostics business is incredibly profitable. It's been incredibly stable. It has great brand and customer allegiance, and it's all about taking low single-digit growth and making it faster.", "You probably saw that we introduced but did not launch yet our Cascadion mass spectrometer, and we will also introduce that at AACC [American Association of Clinical Chemistry]. That is intended for being launched sometime during the course of 2018, so it's not going to affect any revenue this year, but we want customers to get it into the budget cycle. So we're making progress but obviously, we were not planning to launch it this year anyway. But we're just working our way through that process, which should help growth over time as well.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, and then just one follow-up question. You called out in LPS that the channel business was quite strong. Considering that everyone is worried about Amazon in the world today, could you elaborate on how strong the channel business was and just give us a little bit more detail?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "The channel was very strong in the U.S. It was very strong in Europe. It was very strong in biotech and pharma, and it was very strong in industrial. There were no weak spots in the channel business. The team is doing a great job. And we take Amazon very seriously and we always have, and it's our job to manage through that. We're making big investments in our e-commerce capabilities, big investments in supply chain, the great personnel we have working in customer labs every day that really handles the hazardous goods or refrigerated materials. And the customer allegiance we have in the channel is fantastic. So that's how I would characterize it.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, thank you very much. I'll get back in the queue.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. I just want to go back to Life Sciences Solutions for a minute. You talked a bit about bioprocessing growth coming back to the industry average. Is that just a function of the inherent lumpiness of that business, or is there something different going on fundamentally than maybe a quarter or two ago?", "And also within Life Sciences Solutions, I believe this is the first quarter where Affymetrix is fully in organic growth. I'm curious how integration is going there and if Affy was actually dilutive to Life Sciences Solutions organic growth in the quarter.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Doug, thanks for the question. So yes, bioproduction is definitely a lumpy business, and the long-term prospect for bioproduction is fantastic. When you think about the demand for biologics, biosimilars, vaccines in the pipeline, we are very bullish. One of the leading indicators we have is our biosciences business serves the research customer base with those technologies, especially media and sera, and that business is incredibly robust, so the activity level is very strong. So nothing is changing on the long-term outlook. There's some lumpiness. In Q2, while it grew reasonably, it was softer than the very torrid growth that we had the last few quarters, and we would expect that growth will pick up over time there. So that's our view on bioproduction.", "On the microarray business, really good news, we've always been transparent with everything, and we started out slower after the acquisition of that business. We had good growth in the microarray business. We had good growth in the e-biosciences business. Synergies have been very strong. And when you look at the full-year accretion in 2017, I am really excited that the team has put us right back on track for achieving the deal model goals for 2017 after starting off a little bit soft. This team has done a great job, so very good growth in microarrays in the quarter.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you for that. Pivoting to Europe, I think you guys grew low single digits in Europe. That's a bit lower than the growth rate we've seen from you over the past couple of quarters. Some of your peers have actually talked a bit about higher growth in Europe. Could you just talk about how Europe is going by end market and what's factored into guidance in terms of your expectations for the rest of the year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I think Europe \u2013 when I look at performance in Europe, Easter is obviously going to be the big swing factor. I just did a review with the team, our European leadership yesterday, and they feel good. So Q1 was strong. Q2 was more modest growth, and then that's really the shift of where the holiday was. And when they look at their outlook for the balance of the year, it's right in line with growth that should be for the full year just below the company average.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Which is what we had guided to originally.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So I don't see Europe as a major story. If you go down to the end markets, I would say that the diagnostic business across is a little bit softer than we originally would have expected, and the rest of the segments are a little bit stronger would be the take.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, one last one, I just want to make sure. I think this is the case, but I just want to make sure that you still are assuming mid-single-digit to high single-digit biopharmaceutical end market growth in your full-year guidance.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, so the last few years, we've started out our guidance for biopharma end market being mid-single to high single-digit growth, and that continues to be our outlook for this year, so no change. And when you look at the first half, we're right in the middle of that range at this point.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, that's great, thank you again.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning. I wanted to dig a little bit more into the analytical instrument performance, another good organic there. Can you talk about the trends throughout the quarter? Good to hear about chemical analysis, but just how things trended and the outlook there for the rest of the year.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, the Analytical Instruments business, it's a really positive story. And if you think about for a lot of quarters, like many, we've talked about how strong the chrome and mass spec business was and that it was offsetting weakness in chemical analysis. The chrome mass spec business was very strong in the quarter, and it was particularly strong serving the biotech and pharmaceutical customers. So that business is really humming. And chemical analysis returned to growth, which is great. And we saw both our long-cycle and short-cycle revenue to the industrial customer base pick up, and bookings continue to be positive, so that's good.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "And, Jack, this is Stephen. Just to add on the chemical analysis side, we've been seeing that trend for a while in terms of the bookings coming. And it's good to see that both the short-cycle and long-cycle aspect of that business picking up and delivered positive organic growth in Q2.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "And then obviously in the fourth quarter, the last week of September and the fourth quarter, the electron microscopy business will become part of the organic growth calculation for those businesses as well. So the Analytical Instruments team is doing a really good job, and the results demonstrate that.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great, that's helpful, and then one for Stephen. I think it's a similar question I asked last quarter. Just the margins in LPS, could you elaborate a little bit more there? Is it just the biopharma services contract you talked about, or are there any other mix changes in the channel?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "It's really the drivers are the clinical trials business, the biopharma services, the same drivers as last quarter in terms of the pressure there, and that will sunset by Q4.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Outside of that, would margins have been up in the quarter in that segment?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, marginally yes. It's not as if we'll see significant margin expansion over time. But yes, that's correct.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Evans with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thanks. Marc, on the large clinical trial cancellation, if that had not occurred, would you be calling out, say, something more like mid to high single-digit growth this quarter in the pharma end market? Is it big enough to skew things that much?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, it would have been high single-digit growth, right around that range, yes.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Would it have been high single-digit growth without that cancellation?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then just on the EPS bridge, I want to make sure that we have that on the guidance. So it's going up $0.065 at the midpoint. It sounds like that's absorbing $0.05 of interest, and then you've got $0.02 FX. So basically we're talking \u2013 is that right?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Let me just clarify. The $0.065 includes the FX piece, so it's operational performance in Q2 plus the change in FX for the year, and my guidance is $0.02. That gets you the $0.065 increase, and that's offset by $0.05 dilution from the interest cost on the European bond offering.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Other than that, the midpoint is $0.015.", "Tim C. Evans - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "That's great. Thank you, okay.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tim.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tim.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Just I was wondering if you could comment a bit more on what you're seeing in the academic end market. I believe, and I might have missed some of it, you commented that it was a little bit weaker this quarter. I'm just trying to see what you saw both, I guess, from academic and government, both in the U.S. and in Europe, and what your expectations are over the rest of the year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Actually, academic and government, while still low single digit, wasn't weaker. It actually was slightly better than Q1. And, when you look at it, actually North America was a bit better. So I think the fact that you got a 2017 budget, it showed the increase in NIH, that's starting to flow into the results. Geographically, China was good as well, and Europe was a little bit softer, and it's probably mostly timing between Q1 and Q2.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay, and then just one follow-up question for Stephen. Within the guidance bridge that you were talking about there, the operational performance, can you describe or quantify how much of that is stronger growth from FEI versus the underlying base business?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "It's approximately $0.03 more from FEI and $0.015 from the base business.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Great, thank you.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, good morning. Thanks. Marc or Stephen, to your points on chemical analysis, does that feel like that business should stay positive in the back half of the year, just given the way bookings are shaping up?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "We don't forecast by each of our businesses, especially at that level. But clearly, the trends are positive and I think that's a reasonable assumption you're making.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And maybe just on China, curious if you're willing to parse out the growth that you're seeing, or you're expecting this year. If we just look at life sciences, the life sciences piece versus the applied industrial business. Just be helpful to understand the relative contributions there on the two sides of the equation.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So we had mid-teens growth in China. We had strong bookings. The outlook is good for the full year, that's been trends continued. Clearly, our customers value our scale and the experience that we create because of that scale.", "In terms of more color, I would say generally, the business across pharma and biotech, life science research, those typically is pretty strong. Industrial is recovering and growing. Applied is very strong there, as is healthcare and diagnostics. So it's fairly broad-based, right, in terms of what the growth is in China.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And just finishing, on your comment on the outlook, is a double-digit growth rate for the year assumed in guidance for China?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, our guidance assumes basically double-digit growth for China.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "As you know, it's our fastest growing market. It has been and it's a market we think the outlook is very strong.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I think the bookings profile is very positive.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got you, okay. Thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks, it's actually Joel in for Isaac.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Hi, Joel.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Just touching back on the FEI question, maybe just focusing in on the Cryo-EM opportunity, could you maybe comment on whether, just given the underlying academic funding environment, if there's been wallet share dynamics with other technologies in the lab, that you've been gaining some share from, that contributed to the growth in the first half of the year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I think that, from my interactions with customers around Cryo-EM, and there's been a number \u2013 wow, what an amazing technology. The enthusiasm across the customer base is huge, and it's making them rethink other large investment areas that might have traditionally gotten that funding. So, I have not heard funding. In all of the discussions, funding has not come up as an issue, meaning that this is profound enough that customers will go out and get the money. And in those areas where there's lots and lots of funding, that's one way. And if there are other areas where funding is more muted, they're probably taking it from other technologies, and likely from technologies that we don't provide, so we're not cannibalizing ourselves.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks, and then just maybe one on the P&L. Looks like there's been a little bit of an uptick in R&D expense in the first half of the year. Just how should we be thinking about that line item throughout the remainder of 2017?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So in terms of the R&D, the driver of the change as a percentage really is the inclusion of FEI. It has a higher than average across the company spend in R&D. We're continuing to invest in that business, so that dynamic will play out in Q3, and then it will be in the comps in Q4 overall.", "Actually, among Q3 for FEI, just as a reminder, that we have the stub period, which was a very profitable stub period in Q3 last year, and that will be it in our comps in terms of margin expansion as you look at the second half of the year for the company as a whole, so it has a little bit of a drag on Q3 margins.", "Joel Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Great, thanks.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Joel.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Please go ahead.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hi, Marc. Could you talk about FEI? Was the growth there a component of the semiconductor cycle, just the level of \u2013 the breakout of that growth would be helpful? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Sure. So, Paul, when you look at the FEI business, the growth was very, very robust in the life science applications, in the semiconductor applications, and we had good growth in the remaining material science applications. So the business would have delivered strong growth even if semiconductor was more muted, but semiconductor was very strong and bookings were very strong. So that's very positive in terms of how the business is performing.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then regarding China, do you think \u2013 do you see budget cycles or with a five-year plan now in place, is it a consistent rollout this year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "It's been very good now for quite a number of quarters. Since the beginning of 2015, we've had very strong growth every quarter in China, and the outlook continues to be quite good. We're very aligned with the five-year plan. As you know, China has a big focus on environmental protection, a big focus on food safety, and certainly around expanding the healthcare market, as well their healthcare capabilities. So we're seeing broad-based growth, and we would expect China to continue to be our fastest growing end market.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Paul.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, good morning, just a couple housekeeping questions we're seeing. On Patheon, number one, would you care to update us on what you view as the anticipated accretion in year one now that the debt financing is in place? Number two, what are the next steps or exact approval milestones needed before closing? And thirdly, can you just explain the rationale of keeping the interest expense in the core EPS number rather than backing it out before the close?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So I'll do part of it and Stephen will do part of it. I'll do the path to close, and Stephen will do the two financial questions. In terms of the path to close, we obviously got our U.S. clearance quickly. The European Union accepted the filing, which means that they start the regulatory process, which will go on during the course of the summer. And then the last of the regulatory filings, which has a more variable range on when it will wrap up, is Brazil, which we're working through. And then we need to have the shareholder vote and the tender process, which we're working through as well. So we feel very confident that the transaction will close before the end of the year or by the end of the year, and we're just working to work that through as expeditiously as possible.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "And in terms of the financing, obviously we're working to ensure that we've got the permanent financing in place for the timing of the deal close, whenever that may happen. You saw the first part of that being executed last week, which was the European bond offering that we did, so that was $3 billion of a debt raise, so that's just the first element. We've got additional debt to raise and we've got an equity element as well. And we continue to work the rest of those elements, and those details will be public as we execute those.", "In terms of the guidance, so we actually completed the European bond offering, so it's a known event. So I included it in the guidance for the full year. So that's a consistent approach in the way that we have approached pending acquisitions in the past. So we're treating Patheon and its related financing in that consistent way. So as things will crystallize, I put them into the guidance.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Pretty good, thank you.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Brandon.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Dan, we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "And our final question will come from the line of Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, thanks for the questions. You mentioned getting a U.S. budget in place would be a positive. What kind of size of NIH funding increase would you need to see to consider it a good enough outcome?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I was with members of Congress fairly recently. I think the strong support for continued funding of NIH and continued growth in funding, and we'll continue to educate the importance of that. Things like the 21st Century Cures is obviously a positive. To us, what we're focused on is to avoid the continuing resolution, which obviously creates some level of uncertainty and freezes budgets. The House is talking I think a $1 billion increase, and I think the Senate might be talking a little bit more. The exact number to me is less of a focus than an increase in funding and getting a budget done.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay. I have...", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you, Catherine.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Talk about your organic growth assumptions by division for the back half of the year?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Really, I think in terms of the of the full-year outlook, it hasn't changed in terms of our initial guide. So I think Life Sciences Solutions and Analytical Instruments would be the faster-growing businesses out of the four. So that's really the way to think about the speed of growth for the respective businesses for the full year.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Catherine.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So let me just wrap it up briefly. As we reflect on where we are, we're very pleased to have achieved a strong first half, and we're very well-positioned to deliver another great year. And of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We look forward to updating you on the Q3 call. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Thanks to everyone for attending.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our Web-site, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until February 27, 2015. A copy of the press release of our 2014 fourth quarter and full year earnings is available on our Web-site under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the Company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 27, 2014, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our Web-site under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP, including adjusted EPS, adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin which exclude restricting costs, amortization of acquisition related intangible assets and certain other items. The definitions of and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are available in the earnings press release and also in the Investors section of our Web-site under the heading Financial Information.", "So before we get started, one other item, as I mentioned in prior quarters, please note that the commentary that we provide today regarding the Company's Q4 and full year 2014 total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Ken, thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us on the call today. As you saw in our press release, we finished the year with an outstanding fourth quarter delivering excellent growth on both the top and bottom line. In an environment that still has its challenges, we focused intently on our customers, identified opportunities and executed very well to deliver strong growth. At the same time, we continued to make excellent progress with the integration of Life Technologies and are tracking ahead of our initial goals as we approach the one-year anniversary of the close.", "Our excellent performance in Q4 topped off what was a great year for us financially, operationally and strategically. This positions the Company well for a strong year ahead and a very bright future over the longer term. We have a lot of ground to cover this morning, so let me get right to our financial performance in the quarter and what we saw in our key end markets. Then I'll cover some of the highlights of the quarter and the year, give you an update on capital deployment and wrap up with our guidance for 2015.", "So, starting with the quarter, our revenues in Q4 grew 30% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 48%. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 280 basis points to 22.8%. And our strong top line growth and operational discipline led to adjusted EPS of $1.99, which is a 39% increase over Q4 of 2013. Thanks to the determination of our team, we ended the year on a very strong note.", "Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we saw strength across the board and we executed well to capitalize on year-end opportunities. First, let me start with industrial and applied. We had another quarter of mid-single digit growth. Our Research and Safety Channel, chromatography and life sciences mass spec businesses performed particularly well. We saw some year-end spending with our industrial and applied customers in Europe and we're able to capitalize on that.", "In diagnostics and healthcare, we performed well again this quarter with growth remaining in the mid single-digits. We saw a strong demand for our ImmunoDiagnostics products as we had all year. Our transplant diagnostics business and healthcare channel also performed very well in Q4.", "As you may recall, last quarter we talked about our involvement in supporting customers who are working to contain Ebola. We did see some benefit to our Q4 revenue from this activity. Our customers turned to us for help with some of the most difficult challenges and this was another good example.", "Turning to pharma and biotech, this end market was particularly strong in Q4 coming in with high single-digit growth. We continued to effectively leverage the strength of our value proposition to help these customers accelerate innovation and drive out cost and we also captured opportunities from some year-end spending.", "Last, I'm pleased to report that our performance in academic and government was also especially strong in the quarter, growing in the high single digits. More specifically, we saw strong sales of our analytical instruments to several government agencies in the U.S., especially in our life sciences mass spec business. In addition, a number of our businesses took advantage of increased academic and government spending in Europe at the end of the year.", "So in summary, we performed very well across all of our end markets for a strong finish to 2014. That's a good lead into our discussion of the full year. My assessment of the year was pretty simple. We achieved or exceeded all of our goals, whether you measure us by our financial performance, execution of our growth strategy, our integration milestones or our balance sheet. That's a pretty good report card and let me walk you through each of these achievements in a little more detail.", "First looking at our financial performance, our revenues grew 29% for the full year. Adjusted operating income grew 45% with adjusted operating margin expanding 240 basis points to nearly 22%. Let me make a quick comment on the topic of margin expansion. We benefited from the acquisition and from delivering the related synergies and we also continued to drive productivity through our PPI Business System, sourcing, low-cost-region manufacturing and footprint optimization efforts. When you add it all up, we achieved significant margin expansion last year and looking ahead we still have a lot of runway.", "Finally, our strong performance led to a year of outstanding adjusted EPS growth with a 28% increase year-over-year. So overall, we had a great year operationally and we achieved a strong year according to all of our key financial metrics including those related to the Life Technologies acquisition.", "Now let's talk a little bit about executing our growth strategy and the terrific progress we've made there. As you know, the three elements of our strategy are, developing innovative new products, expanding our presence in emerging markets and leveraging our unique customer value proposition to gain market share. Let me review some of the highlights from the year and a few from the quarter.", "First, 2014 was another strong year of new product innovation. We have the largest R&D budget by far in our industry and invest about $700 million annually, and that investment is resulting in key new product launches across our technology offerings in Analytical Instruments, Life Sciences Solutions and Specialty Diagnostics.", "I don't have time to go into every product we talked about during the year but just to do a quick recap, here are some of the standouts. In Analytical Instruments, we strengthened our industry leadership across our Thermo Scientific mass spec and chromatography offerings. We launched the new Q Exactive HF which was the latest generation in our Orbitrap family, and we also launched the Prelude and Endura MD systems for clinical use. It was also a pretty big year for chromatography with the launch of Chromeleon 7.2 software and the Vanquish UHPLC system.", "In our Life Sciences Solutions business, we strengthened our Ion Torrent next-gen sequencing offering with a number of new product launches. Among the highlights was the Ion PGM Dx instrument for clinical use in the U.S. and Europe. We've also been very focused on delivering NGS based panels for clinical oncology, so cancer treatment can be more effectively targeted to the patient. A good example from 2014 was the Oncomine Solid Tumor DNA kit we launched last year in Europe.", "In October, we leveraged our capabilities and HLA expertise in our Genetics Sciences and Specialty Diagnostics businesses to launch the research-use-only NXType Kit. This is a workflow for HLA Tissue Typing for transplant patients that we believe will play an important role in further improving Tissue Typing accuracy and transplant success rates. We've heard great customer feedback, so this is a clear example of how our businesses are working together to bring value to our customers. Also in Specialty Diagnostics, we launched the PCT Direct for point of care testing to expand the market for our high-growth biomarker business.", "So as you can see, 2014 was a very strong year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products for customers working in research, applied markets and the clinic, and we have a great lineup ahead for 2015.", "Turning to emerging markets, the second element of our growth strategy, the big topic in 2014 was China. We continued to strengthen our industry-leading capabilities in China and delivered mid-single-digit growth in 2014 in a muted government funding environment. While the Chinese government works through the process of implementing reforms, we will keep you posted as to when we see an inflection point indicating faster growth. Thermo Fisher's capabilities are well aligned with key government priorities including food safety, a cleaner environment and expansion of the healthcare system. So we remain very bullish on the long-term prospects for strong growth in China.", "In the meantime, we haven't been standing still, we've been expanding our presence in other emerging markets like Southeast Asia, India and Brazil to gain additional momentum in these growth regions as well. And we also continue to optimize our footprint in the U.S. and Europe. You may recall that we expanded our Centers of Excellence in Lithuania and Germany earlier in 2014, and in Q4 we had the grand opening for our new Center of Excellence for Specialty Diagnostics in Fremont, California. I was there for the ribbon-cutting and I have to say the facility is quite impressive and a real showcase for production of immunoassays and diagnostic tests. I think our strong performance in 2014 shows that we've done a great job leveraging our global footprint to meet the needs of our customers and capture growth opportunities.", "The last point I want to make about our growth strategy is that our customer value proposition continues to get stronger as more customers in a range of industries relies on us to help them meet their growth objectives. We've been leveraging our value proposition in BioPharma with great success as you know and we also had some nice wins with industrial customers who are seeing the benefit of our depth of capabilities.", "One of the biggest highlights here in 2014 was the addition of Life Technologies. It further strengthened our ability to help our customers drive innovation and productivity and really positions us well to continue to gain share with our biotech, pharma and industrial customers.", "That's a good segue to the integration, clearly a major achievement for us in 2014. Our over-riding goal with the acquisition of Life Technologies is to combine our capabilities in a way that serves our customers best to drive growth, and we're off to a great start. As you know, in this phase of the integration, we've been focused on delivering the cost synergies, planning the revenue synergies and making sure that we set the business up for accelerated growth.", "In terms of the cost synergies, we achieved $150 million in cost synergies last year. As we've mentioned previously, that was faster than we originally outlined and we're well on track to deliver the $300 million of cost synergies in year three. Turning to the revenue synergies, we've been developing detailed plans since the close to realize the benefits of our combined capabilities. We're now implementing those plans and are starting to deliver revenue synergies this year. We're very confident in achieving our goal of $150 million of revenue synergies in year three which is 2016.", "Our team has done a lot of work here and it's exciting to see the plans start to materialize. For example in early January this year, we introduced about 14,000 SKUs from the former Life Technologies organization into our research channel in North America. Our sales reps are being trained to represent the expanded portfolio and the team is excited about the opportunities. Although it's early days, our customers have been responding very favorably. The final word I want to leave you with on the integration is that the Life Sciences Solutions business grew about 1% faster in 2014 than it had in the past three years. This is another indicator that the integration is off to a great start.", "Onto the last major achievement of the year, in terms of our balance sheet, 2014 was all about repaying debt. We generated strong cash flow and paid down $3.8 billion of debt in 2014 related to the acquisition of Life Technologies. That got us to a leverage ratio of about 3.6x by year-end. Given the pace of delevering and the confidence in our cash flows, we started deploying capital immediately in 2015. In fact, we bought back $500 million of our stock in the first few weeks of the year. We have many opportunities ahead to create shareholder value t6hr our proven strategy of effectively deploying capital.", "Let me now turn to our guidance for 2015. Pete will cover the details now on all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments. Our 2015 guidance reflects a number of factors. First, it takes into account our very strong underlying operating performance. It also includes the revenue synergies we expect to achieve as well as the continuation in the ramp-up of cost synergies. It factors in contributions below line from share repurchases we just completed and tax planning initiatives we are implementing. And as you are well aware, we're also operating in a very challenging FX environment.", "So when you sum it all up, we're initiating revenue guidance in the range of $16.80 billion to $17.0 billion in 2015, which is about flat with the last year and includes a 4.5% headwind from foreign currency. On the bottom line, our adjusted EPS assumes an 8 percentage point headwind from currency. So we're guiding to adjusted EPS of $7.22 to $7.40. This would result in 4% to 6% growth over our strong EPS performance in 2014.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, our team worked with amazing intensity on all fronts throughout 2014. Their efforts led to a very strong year and that puts us in an excellent position going into 2015. Second, in terms of our guidance for 2015, the unfavorable FX is masking our strong underlying operating performance in the short-term. We'll see how rates play out as the year unfolds and update our guidance accordingly. If rates deteriorate further, we'll determine how much we can offset. If they improve, we'll add the benefit to our revenue and earnings.", "So in summary, we will continue to execute well, deliver growth and set Thermo Fisher up for a very successful future. With that, I'll now like to turn the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full-year 2014 financial performance for the total Company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2015 guidance.", "As a reminder, at the total Company level, we're reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we'll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition in early February this year. However for the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we're providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance of that segment.", "So starting with our overall financial performance in the fourth quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 39% to $1.99. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $6.96, up 28% from 2013. GAAP EPS was $1.49 in Q4, up 62% from $0.92 in the prior year's quarter, and $4.71 for the full year 2014, up 35% from 2013.", "As you saw in our press release this morning, starting with the top line, we delivered 6% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 30% year-over-year. Q4 reported revenue includes 26% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 3% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note that the components of the Q4 change in revenue did not sum due to rounding.", "For the full year, total revenue increased 29% year-over-year and organic revenue was 4%, slightly above the high-end of our most recent guidance as a result of our very strong results in Q4. Full-year reported revenue includes 25% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a slightly negative impact from FX. We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings 2% higher than revenue.", "Looking at growth by geography, in the quarter North America grew in the high single digits and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia Pacific grew low single digits with China growing mid-single digits. Rest of the world grew in the low single digits. For the full year, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits, Asia-Pacific and China grew at the same rates as Q4, and rest of world was essentially flat.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 22.8%, up 280 basis points from Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 45% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 240 basis points from 2013. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter and the full year benefited from the Life Technologies acquisition and achieving the related synergies.", "That said, we also continued to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System. We realized $13 million of benefit from our restructuring actions in Q4 and $49 million for the full year, and we realized $42 million of synergy benefits in Q4 and $115 million for the full year. We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L, total Company adjusted gross margin came in at 49% in Q4, up 470 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the addition of Life Technologies along with solid productivity across our businesses. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.8%, up 460 basis points from 2013.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22.1% of revenue, which is 80 basis points unfavorable to 2013. Again, this was primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 22.9%, 130 basis points unfavorable to 2013.", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue for both the quarter and full year, 110 basis points above last year. This increase reflects the impact of the relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for full year 2014 was 6.4%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $107 million, up $45 million from last year. The increase was driven by interest on the debt we raised on fund the Life Technologies acquisition as well as the debt issuance we completed this past November to refinance maturities through the first half of 2015. Net interest expense for the full year was $432 million, an increase of $198 million from 2013.", "Adjusted other income for Q4 was $9 million, $10 million higher than Q4 2013, and for the full year it was $13 million, $9 million higher than last year, both driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.2%, 270 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning and the U.S. R&D tax credit which was approved in Q4. Given late approval of the R&D credit, we recognized the entire full-year benefit in the fourth quarter. Our year-to-date rate was 14.5%, lower than our full-year guidance of 15%, as a result of the R&D tax credit.", "In terms of returning capital, we continued to pay our dividend and paid out $60 million in the quarter and $235 million for the year. Average diluted shares were 404.1 million in Q4, up 33 million or 9% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition and to a much lesser extent option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 402.3 million, up 36 million from 2013.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.62 billion and free cash flow was $2.25 billion, after deducting $378 million of net capital expenditures. This is $50 million above our full-year guidance as a result of very strong cash flow performance in Q4. It's also up significantly from our prior year cash flow, primarily as a result of increased operating earnings from the acquisition as well as the standalone business. This increase was partially offset by acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures.", "We ended the quarter with $1.35 billion in cash and investments, up $800 million sequentially from Q3. This increase was driven by free cash flow in the quarter and the November debt issuance I mentioned earlier, partially offset by incremental paydown of our term loan.", "Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $14.6 billion, up $100 million from Q3 and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6x total debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. As Marc mentioned, we spent $500 million in the first few weeks of January on share buybacks, and given our 2015 financial guidance and that we've resumed capital deployment early in the year, we now expect to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5x to 3x by the end of 2015.", "So let me wrap-up my comments on the total Company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 2014 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points from Q3. This shows that we're delivering increased returns across the business which are offsetting the short term dilution of adding another quarter of the Life Technologies investment into the average invested capital base.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, in Q4 total revenue grew to $1.19 billion from $192 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of the divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned in both periods, organic revenue grew 7%. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our bio production, qPCR, cell biology and next-generation sequencing businesses. Overall, we benefited from year-end spending by our pharma and biotech customers as well as government customers in the U.S. and Europe. For the year, reported revenue grew to $4.2 billion, with pro forma organic growth of slightly above 3.5%, driven by strong performance in the fourth quarter.", "Q4 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition and achieving the related synergies, with adjusted operating margin up 660 basis points to 30.8%. For all of 2014, adjusted operating margin was 29%, 520 basis points higher than the prior year.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue grew 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. We had strong growth in our life sciences mass spec, chromatography and services businesses in the quarter. For the year, reported revenue growth was 3% and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments stayed flat to the prior year and adjusted operating margin was 20.2%, down 30 basis points.", "In this segment, we delivered very strong productivity that was more than offset by strategic growth investments along with unfavorable foreign exchange and business mix. For all of 2014, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 17.9%, 20 basis points higher than 2013.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q4 total revenue grew 4% and organic growth was very strong again at 7%. We continued to deliver strong growth across much of the portfolio. As Marc mentioned, our ImmunoDiagnostics business had a very strong quarter and growth in our Transplant Diagnostics and biomarkers business were robust as well. Our healthcare channel also had a strong finish to the year, in part driven by sales of seasonal products. For the full year, both reported and organic revenue grew 5%.", "Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 6% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 27.1%, up 70 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong pull-through on the organic growth, strong productivity and a positive benefit from FX, partially offset by strategic growth investments. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 27.4%, up 30 basis points from 2013.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue grew 2% and organic revenue grew 8%. Our Research and Safety Channel showed particular strength benefiting from continued improvement in U.S. academic and government markets and year-end spending by our BioPharma and industrial customers. For the full year, reported revenue grew 3% and organic revenue grew 5%.", "Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services was flat for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%, down 40 basis points driven by unfavorable business mix and the Cole-Parmer divestiture, partially offset by solid productivity and favorable price. For the full year 2014, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, down 10 basis points from the prior year.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2015 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2015 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.22 to $7.40, which represents growth of 4% to 6% over our 2014 EPS of $6.96. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $16.80 billion to $17.00 billion, which is about flat with our reported revenue of $16.89 billion in 2014.", "As Marc mentioned, we're seeing an unprecedented negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the recent strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus our major foreign currencies. As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'd give you a bit more color on FX to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance.", "Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.58 or 8%. So if you were to look at our 2015 guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 12% to 14%, which represents very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, FX is lowering our revenue by about 4.5%, so our FX neutral reported growth guidance would be 4% to 5%.", "Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions net of divestitures are expected to contribute about 50 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%, which includes Life Technologies after February 3, the one year anniversary of the close date.", "The midpoint of our 2015 organic revenue growth guidance is essentially the same as our 2014 organic growth when calculated on a pro forma basis including Life Technologies. We're not expecting any significant changes in our growth assumptions by end market compared to 2014.", "And that being said, there is a slight mix shift by end market as a result of including Life Sciences Solutions in our 2015 organic growth calculation from February onward. As a result, we're expecting slightly slower growth in pharma and biotech in the mid to high single digits and slightly stronger growth in academic and government although still in the low single digits. We expect growth in diagnostics and healthcare as well as industrial and applied to be consistent with 2014 at around the Company average.", "For the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we expect pro forma organic growth of 3% to 4% for 2015. Compared to 2014, growth in this segment will benefit from revenue synergies but will face a more difficult growth comparison and some dilution from the divestitures.", "Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. Our guidance also does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin, we're expecting around 50 to 70 basis points of expansion year-over-year. In terms of pull-through on the FX revenue headwind, we're expecting a substantial unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $275 million or about 37% average margin and 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. This is being driven primarily by the weakening of the euro and Japanese yen.", "With the addition of Life Technologies, the euro now pulls through to our adjusted operating income at a little more than 35% and the yen is consistent with prior years at 60% pull-through. So if you were to look at our 2015 guidance on an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be very strong at 120 to 140 basis points.", "We're aggressively managing our cost base and driving top line actions to offset as much of the FX headwind as possible without damaging our future growth prospects. We're also managing the FX impact with below the line actions such as share buybacks, further optimizing our debt structure and initiating additional tax planning strategies. In total, we expect our productivity drivers to yield about 260 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion.", "Similar to last year, we expect to deliver productivity from our PPI Business System, our global sourcing initiatives including low-cost region sourcing and manufacturing, our footprint optimization actions and we're assuming about $115 million of incremental cost synergy benefit in 2015, and that will realize about $60 million of revenue synergies with around $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This puts us well on track to achieve our year three goal of $350 million of combined cost and revenue synergies. These benefits will be somewhat offset by select strategic investments to continue to drive growth primarily in emerging markets and also to enhance our customer experience.", "Moving below line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million, about $50 million lower than 2014. The decrease is primarily as a result of continuing to pay down our term loan along with settling our 2015 maturities, a portion of which will be financed with our November 2014 bond issuance.", "We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, down slightly from 14.5% in 2014. In this projection, we're assuming that the R&D tax credit will be approved again in 2015 or that we'll do some incremental tax planning above our base assumptions to replace it.", "In terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends and $500 million through share buybacks which as I mentioned we completed earlier this month. This leaves about $400 million remaining on our current share buyback authorization.", "Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 403 million to 404 million, up slightly from 2014, and we're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million. Finally, in terms of full year 2015 free cash flow, we're expecting about $2.6 billion, up $350 million compared to 2014.", "As a final note on guidance, I thought it'd be helpful to give you some insight into what we're expecting for Q1 2015, because Q1 last year included only a partial quarter of the Life Technologies acquisition and that resulted in higher than normal margin due to the timing of revenue and expenses throughout the quarter.", "We're expecting Q1 2015 reported revenue growth of 1% to 3%, and organic revenue growth of 2% to 4%. In terms of Q1 earnings, we're expecting adjusted EPS growth of 2% to 6% and adjusted operating margin expansion of about 15 basis points. In addition, we expect our interest expense and tax rate to be higher in Q1 than the average for the year as a result of the phasing of paying down debt and implementing tax planning throughout the year.", "As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as FX fluctuations during the year.", "In summary, we delivered a strong finish to the year which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2015. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher management staff, I would like to ask that you limit your time on the call to one or two questions. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue and pose your question in turn. Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "Wow, first question for a change. So just one quick one and then just one other one, so Pete, you're a day less in Q1 this year by your calendar, is that my correct calculation on that?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, it's one less day in Q1 and then we pick up the day again in Q4.", "Derik de Bruin", "Okay, just making sure that that's there. And I guess on China, can you just sort of \u2013 I mean a couple of your competitors made some noise about seeing at least a little bit of improvement or seeing some potential pickup, I mean what's embedded into your organic revenue growth guidance for China this year?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of China, looking back at last year, mid-single digit growth in the quarter, mid-single digit growth for the full-year, bookings growth was stronger at high single-digit, so we built a little bit of backlog. From our perspective, we're assuming in the guidance that market conditions are going to be very similar in 2015 to 2014, and obviously when we hit an inflection point for accelerated growth and we'll obviously communicate it, but there's not a huge amount of transparency right now into when the government is going to step up spending. So based on the fact that 2015 has an easier comparison versus what we've had last year, that should hopefully be a conservative assumption on China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "On the quarter, in and of itself, I mean you had, and a couple of other businesses had their best sprint of the year from a growth perspective, if you sort of look under the hood and examine where the greatest deltas were in the Q at least relative to your expectations, ex maybe one-off things like flu, where do you feel like the core performance really inflected and it was sort of a market or share or kind of underlying dynamic, because I think the numbers across the board in some of the pieces were a lot there than certainly we were looking for?", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Ross, the team across our businesses and across the globe performed very well, and the 6% organic growth, the strength in each of our business segments really was a highlight. Very nice to see the Life Sciences Solutions business had very strong growth in the quarter, delivered a very nice year overall with about 3.5% growth on the full-year which is about 1 point better than what it had been growing the prior year. So that's a real positive. But we saw good performance in our channel businesses, both in Specialty Diagnostics and in the Research and Safety one within Lab Products and Services, and generally a great year with our mass spec and chroma business as well, so really strong across the board.", "Ross Muken", "And obviously relative to 2015, very difficult environment, you sort of noted sort of unprecedented from an FX perspective, so as you sort of saw rates shift in the last several weeks, what are the sorts of discussions you have internally in terms of whether it's prudent to do something more aggressive on the cost side or push up synergy capture, I mean it's obviously a hard thing to judge and the magnitude of the moves have been kind of again more volatile than we would have thought, so as you think about sort of the potential offsets or how you plan out the rest of the year because you've never been shy doing things into a year, what are the key things we should look for to figure out if maybe we see further offsetting items that come later in Q2 or Q3 or beyond?", "Marc N. Casper", "So that's a great question. So the way the team has thought about it is the following, which is Company is performing extraordinarily well operationally, good momentum with our customers, and when we looked at the FX headwind, the way the team has responded, is signed up for a more aggressive operating plan, right. So you look at it, the midpoint of our guidance at organic growth of 4% is stronger than the last few years. When you look at the underlying margin assumptions, EPS assumptions, with only $0.5 billion of capital deployment, you're seeing very strong fundamental actions.", "Some businesses took incremental cost actions, some businesses signed up for more growth, and basically we have a great team of people around the world, we discuss it business by business and so what's the best way to maximize our performance. So that's to look at how we're dealing with the situation right now at this moment in time.", "Looking forward, if rates improve, we're just going to let that flow to the bottom line and just raise the guidance. If rates deteriorate, then what the team is going to do is try to offset as much as we can without damaging obviously the Company for the long-term. So it's not a plus or minus, we're only \u2013 it moves evenly if the world gets more difficult, we'll offset what we can do, and if the world gets better that all goes to the bottom line. So that's how we're thinking about it.", "Ross Muken", "I guess you probably never imagined a year where you'd have as strong a core growth as you're having, it would only drop down to 5% earnings growth.", "Marc N. Casper", "The way I look at it is, we have managed through lots of different environments and we exit every one of these periods a stronger, more competitive industry leader, and I view the FX changes as an opportunity for Thermo Fisher to plough through this and come out as an incredibly strong company with great financial performance, and we'll look back at this period, whether it's one month, six months or a couple of years in terms of this type of environment, and I think our shareholders and certainly our customers will say, wow, Thermo Fisher distinguished itself once again. So that's how we're thinking about it, we'll be super-aggressive in managing the business.", "Ross Muken", "Alright, thanks Marc.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro", "So just want to ask a quick question on the LPS business, just trying to get a sense of the extent to which you felt like market share or mix might have been part of the strong performance?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in the LPS segment, we have more exposure to the academic and government customer base there and that obviously had strong year-end spend both in Europe and the U.S., so that helped us from an end market perspective. And our Research Channel business, Research and Safety Channel business is doing great, it's performing well and I think it continues to gain market share. So it's a combination of those two events.", "Isaac Ro", "Got it. And then, in the forensics business, that's obviously been a really nice business for you guys over the years, both prior to the Life acquisition and since. Looking ahead, it seems like there's a little new competition coming on the marketplace. What's your plan to sort of defend your turf there and maybe try and expand the market to a sustained, a healthy growth rate?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of forensics, we're the industry leader globally, we have a great position between our Sanger sequencing and some customers are starting to look at NGS and we play a role there as well. So we're leveraging our installed base and decades long relationships with these customers to make sure that they're getting what they need. It's a conservative customer base and we're well-positioned there. We work with a variety of governmental agencies as well to help them expand the market and create new opportunities for forensics testing, we're right in the midst of that, and that rewards us with good market share.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Nice quarter. Maybe just kind of going back to the prior questions on some of the offsets for FX, and maybe for Pete, I'm wondering if you could talk about whether any of the tax strategies that you alluded to could have an impact this year. And then on the repo, I assume you'll complete the remaining 400 million. That sounds like that wasn't embedded in guidance, but beyond that, should we assume that buybacks are a bit more of a priority than bolt-on or larger M&A in this environment?", "Marc N. Casper", "Let me do the capital deployment one and then Pete will cover the other part. In terms of capital deployment, our assumption in the guidance is to have $1 billion. That we completed. In terms of the balance of how we think about the year, we'll continue to look at bolt-on M&A and where it makes sense we have a good pipeline, so we'll look at that. And then obviously as the year unfolds, we'll determine whether it makes sense to do additional share buybacks or not. So right now, what's embedded in the guidance is what we've done and then we'll update you in the future quarters about how we're going to deploy capital.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Then on the tax rate, so Tycho, we've baked in a significant amount of tax planning actions into our guidance, and as I said we've included the R&D tax credit, so that's worth about $20 million. It hasn't been approved yet but it's been approved the last number of years. So we decided to put it into our guidance this time around. So if that doesn't happen for some reason, then we would actually have to come up with $20 million of incremental tax planning in order to offset it, which we feel confident that we can do, but that's the way it's set up in our guidance.", "Tycho Peterson", "Then in terms of some of the assumptions by segment or customer base embedded in guidance, you talked about mid-single-digit to high single digit growth in pharma biotech. Can you maybe just talk about the momentum there, is this largely from some of the larger global accounts? And then on academic, low single digit seems like a reasonable starting point. I think there are some discussions and do you see you could see a more meaningful bump than has been proposed to the NIH, so any intel you can share from what you're hearing out of DC on the budget?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in pharma and biotech, obviously had a very strong year in 2014, high single digit growth in the quarter and the year. As we look to this coming year, there were some mid to high single digits simply because we have the Life Technologies included in the end market calculation. So that just makes it a bit of a broader base but we focus on gaining share.", "Academic and government, right now the funding level in the NIH is modest growth. There's a lot of dialog going on about increased opportunities but that hasn't yet obviously translated. Obviously there was a little bit of a mention in the State of the Union and Dr. Collins, the Head of the NIH, has been out actively talking to the industry and the constituents about opportunities to make investments there. So we'll see how that plays out, if it gets even stronger than what we anticipated at this point.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then just lastly, if we think about the strong dollar, any chance you would maybe accelerate some international investments? I know you're moving some manufacturing to Singapore. Are there other opportunities to maybe benefit from the strong dollar in terms of your manufacturing footprint?", "Marc N. Casper", "It's a good question. So in terms of manufacturing, one of the things that we're doing, we're moving more of our production of reagents to our Lithuanian site which is both low-cost and obviously we'll benefit from the exchange rates. Over time, we'll increase sort of the natural hedge in our business by increasing our manufacturing footprint in Europe by selecting our lowest cost facility to do that. So we've got a very substantial presence in Lithuania and continue to expand that out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "My first question is on M&A. So the Life deal was completed about a year ago, you're in a position to get the debt-to-EBITDA ratio down to 2.5x this year, could you just give us a refresher on your M&A criteria including size parameters, maximum leverage parameters and ROIC targets and over what period? And related to this, is it fair to conclude that while it would be tough to do anything in Life Sciences Solutions given ongoing Life Tech integration efforts, that sizeable deals that have overlap with other business units are fair game if they make sense?", "Marc N. Casper", "Great question. So given that we haven't done, after doing very large transactions we had a quieter year, it's a good opportunity to refresh everyone on our M&A approach, right, and it's obviously been fine-tuned over 15 years and we have a great track record here. The strategy is around, acquisitions have to strengthen the Company strategically. It has to be well understood and appreciated by our customers and it clearly has to create shareholder value as measured by return on invested capital. Our hurdle rate has remained the same over very long periods of time which is an 8.5% cost of capital is what we assume, it is the hurdle rate, meaning that we're targeting double-digit returns or better when we deploy capital internally or externally.", "In terms of areas of focus for M&A, it would cut across our higher tech portions of our portfolio, Life Sciences Solutions, Specialty Diagnostics, Analytical Instruments. And in terms of the scale of deals, we don't have any size constraints, although the way I think about it is, over the last 10, 15 years, we've done two large deals and we've done, I don't know, 75 to 100 bolt-ons, right. So the predominance of what we do is bolt-ons and in any given year you should expect us to look at some smaller transactions, and then once every few years when the stars line up sometimes larger things happen.", "In terms of the target leverage ratios, we like to operate day to day in the 2.5x to 3x. We're willing to spike up to about 4.5x. So we have plenty of capacity at any point in time if we want to deploy capital on something that clearly creates shareholder value, and occasionally those larger opportunities present themselves, but I think you should expect us to be doing bolt-on acquisitions as based on where the number of companies really are in terms of opportunities.", "Doug Schenkel", "And the last part of the question on a bit by segment, is it right to assume that LSS is probably not ready for something big but other areas might be if the opportunity presents itself?", "Marc N. Casper", "I mean generally the LSS \u2013 I mean not generally, specifically, the LSS team is doing an incredible job of managing the business, the team is nailing it. Is it likely that we'll have very large transaction there? No, I think it's a little likely here event, but I'm very confident in the team, but I would say we're really focused on running what we have, and where things to create shareholder value and strengthen the Company, we'll look at them.", "Doug Schenkel", "Okay. And then I guess my second question is really on the pharmaceutical end market. It clearly sounds like momentum has continued there for not just you but others in the group. For Thermo specifically, you guys have been pretty strong in this end market for a while and that's a function of not just recent cross-group trends but also new products and really your ability to package products across different verticals. Could you talk about two things, one is, how you're feeling about your ability to continue to pick up share the way you have over the last few years via your portfolio approach, and I guess the second part of it is, how should we think about visibility on sustainability? Q4 for example was really, really strong. Is there any risk of that there is some pull-forward of spend that might lead to a moderation in growth at least in the first half of the year and how do you factor that into guidance? Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of the continuation of the ability to gain share, the leverage of our value proposition, highly, highly confident, we have gotten only better, right. We have more experience, more case studies, more customers willing to do referrals and even more capabilities with the addition of Life Technologies to our portfolio. So we're doing well and we have lots of opportunity to continue to drive that, we're expanding the number of accounts we're focused on and generally I feel great about it.", "In terms of visibility, I have pretty good visibility into the end market. I mean it bounces around a little bit quarter to quarter. In terms of \u2013 the easiest way to answer is more how to think about the year, alright, if we're saying \u2013 we are saying, the 4% organic growth is the midpoint of the guidance for the full-year for the Company, we have a little lower organic growth in Q1, as Pete mentioned in his opening comments, and we expect the second half of the year to be slightly stronger than the first half of the year on an organic basis. So that is a comment on all the end markets as opposed to a comment specifically on pharma, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Marc, I wanted to follow-up on a comment you made in your prepared remarks about academic spending trends. It's clearly embedded in the overall outlook and you've referenced a couple of points where academic was particularly solid at the end of the year. I wonder if you could point us to where over the course of 2015 you think there's the most opportunity for improvement, not so much in terms of execution but in terms of the end market specifically in academic and government.", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Steve, as we look at 2015, we're expecting low single digits but a little bit better than the low single digits we delivered in 2014. We're expecting the U.S. to be slightly stronger because the customer base has more visibility to the budgets now and that allows them to spend. So that should play out exactly as we thought on the academic and government, which was weaker spending in the first half of the year, stronger spending in the second. We expect this year the environment to be stable and modest growth, so U.S. a little better. We think Europe will be a little bit more muted just given the economic environment there, but still a little better in aggregate across the globe.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then a broader question on seasonality in the model, I mean when we look at 2013 and again in 2014, in both years we were surprised a bit to the upside on organic growth, and we can point to different factors in each year, but I wonder is it possible that we're getting into a world where the business is a little bit more seasonal where the fourth quarter does trend a little bit stronger than it might have on a relative basis as compared to prior years and we should think about that in terms of how we model the second half of 2015?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of overall activity, the fourth quarter is by far the strongest because you've had some factors change over the last few years. One is the way healthcare utilization patterns have operated with low activity in the beginning of the year and then it ramps. So in terms of absolute dollars, Q4 is very strong. In terms of the organic growth, it shouldn't affect things, right. Organic growth in that respect shouldn't be affected by that change.", "What is happened, at least as we look back at the last couple of years in the fourth quarter is, the economic environment has been pretty stable and customers have been willing to release year-end funds. In both years, it was always at the beginning of those years some uncertainty, could the world be bad, and at the end of the year the world played out okay and people released money. So I think there's a bit of a people holding back until the end of the year, a little bit of caution, and then if things look okay then they release funds. So I think that's going on a little bit.", "Steve Beuchaw", "Thanks so much.", "Marc N. Casper", "Melissa, we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Willoughby", "Really just two things. First I guess, Pete, as it relates to your guidance for 2015 looking at operating margins, I know you broke out the negative impact from FX. Could you maybe also help us think about the 50 to 70 basis points you guys are guiding to operating margin expansion in 2015, what is the makeup of that expansion, is there any incremental benefit from Life, gross margins versus leveraging other expenses?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Sure. So just in terms of the split between the elements of the P&L, if you take the midpoint, of 60 basis points about 30 comes from gross margin and about 30 comes from SG&A, and we expect to hold the R&D percent of revenue pretty much flat year-over-year. And then in terms of how it breaks out between the different elements, FX and price/volume mix, so price/volume mix is about 50 basis points. As I mentioned earlier, foreign exchange is a 70 basis point dilution. There's about 10 basis points net between the acquisition and divestiture. So that represents the divestitures related to the acquisition as well as the Cole-Parmer divestiture, and then just picking up one month of Life Technologies that we didn't get last year. Productivity, about 190 basis points; synergy, 70 basis points; inflation, negative 90; and then about 100 basis points of investments. That's a pretty similar profile to what we've seen in prior years with the exception of obviously the foreign exchange dilution is very significant. So other than that, it's pretty much a normal year.", "Steve Willoughby", "Okay, thanks so much for that. And then just secondly, in terms of the revenue synergies Marc alluded to, you guys are starting to do some of that in 2015. I might have missed it, but did you give a number of what you're factoring in for revenue synergies in 2015 in your guidance?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, I did. It's 60 million in revenue and we're assuming about 20 million EBITDA pull-through on that.", "Marc N. Casper", "Great. So let me thank everyone. We're going to wrap-up the call. Obviously we're pleased to deliver an outstanding quarter, a great year in 2014. We're looking forward to build on that momentum, have a really strong 2015, and of course thanks for the support to Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thanks everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call.

On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations, until August 24, 2012. A copy of the press release of our 2012 second quarter and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also, during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2012 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "With that, I will now turn the call over to Marc Casper.", "Marc N. Casper", "Well, good morning, and this is Marc. And don't worry, I know Pete is here as well as is Ken, and I know from our investors' perspective, Ken is always the highest rated IR executive out there in the industry, and he's smiling next to me. So no anxiety should be on the phone, we actually have good news to report throughout this call.", "So I'm pleased to report that we had another excellent quarter, with record Q2 results on both the top and bottom line. The quarter was all about execution. Our team executed well to deliver solid revenue growth and another quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS.", "Our strong performance in the first half puts us in very good position to achieve our revenue and earnings goals for the full year. I'll frame my remarks this morning by first covering the financial highlights, give you a sense of what we're seeing in our key end markets relative to our results, and then review some of the exciting new developments we announced during the quarter and in recent weeks.", "First, the financials. As I mentioned, we delivered record adjusted EPS again this quarter, a 23% increase over 2011. Our revenue grew by 9% over last year. Our adjusted operating income increased 16% in Q2, and we achieved 110 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. Our Q2 results clearly show that our teams are focused on the right priorities. Our growth initiatives are delivering real value for our customers, and our ongoing cost actions are strengthening the bottom line. On the growth side of the equation, our investments in Asia-Pacific are really paying off, with strong results again this quarter. I'll mention a little more on that in a few moments.", "In new products, we're seeing nice uptake across our analytical instruments portfolio, and we continue to innovate to keep that pipeline full. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating across a broader customer set from pharma and biotech where we initiated the approach, to medical device manufacturers, reference and contract testing labs as well.", "Turning to cost actions for a moment. This is an area that we're always extremely focused on and is a key contributor to our margin expansion. Our PPI and PPI Lean business systems are a way of life at Thermo Fisher, and they have helped earn us a reputation for operational excellence. While PPI is just one of the ways that we drive margin expansion, as you know, we have multiple levers we can pull, and in the environment we're managing through today, this gives us the ability to quickly adapt to changing market conditions.", "For example, our restructuring actions are being implemented smoothly and are contributing to our growth on the bottom line. Let me now put our second quarter performance in the context of our key end markets. We all know the world is uncertain. We're focused on planning accordingly and adjusting as necessary, always with a sharp eye on using our unique depth of capabilities to gain competitive advantage.", "I'll start with a focus on our 4 key end markets and then I'll comment on our performance in the major geographies. From an overall perspective, our end markets remain consistent with what we've been seeing in recent quarters.", "Let me provide a bit more detail. Starting with academic and government. These markets are consistent with what we've been seeing so far this year. They're still down low-single digits, as we expected, so our outlook here hasn't changed. As we said last quarter, our customers remained active in their research efforts, and Laboratory Consumables spending has been steady despite the capital equipment side being somewhat constrained.", "Turning to healthcare and diagnostics. Conditions were basically a continuation of what we've seen over the last several quarters. In particular, sales of clinical diagnostic products remained very robust, driven largely by ongoing strength in our biomarkers business. In industrial and applied markets, we continue to do very well, in aggregate, with high-single-digit growth, even though not surprisingly, we did see some softness in Europe. We saw strong sales and bookings for our long lead time process analyzers again this quarter, particularly from key customers in the mining industry.", "Last, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech, where we believe we continue to gain share. Our BioProcess Production business had another great quarter. Demand for sera, media and single-use disposable products was driven by growth in biotherapeutics in the U.S. and increased production of vaccines and biosimilars in Asia-Pacific countries.", "Let me make a few comments on end markets from a geographic perspective. We did see some weakening in Europe during the quarter as expected, although the positive news is that we're still growing there. We saw excellent growth in Asia-Pacific, and our performance there was slightly stronger than in Q1.", "On the topic of Asia-Pacific, let me mention here that our company level strategy to expand our presence in emerging high-growth markets is really paying off. We had good growth in India and South Korea, and our team in China delivered another quarter of revenue growth, topping 20%.", "Growth in China is coming from investments our customers are making across our key end markets, including Biopharma, healthcare and environmental monitoring. We continue to attract top talent in China as we build out our manufacturing, R&D and commercial capabilities to fully leverage our value proposition and gain market share.", "Now I'll turn to a few of the business highlights in the second quarter, all of which are great examples of how we're creating value for our customers by strengthening our industry-leading offering. I said last quarter that I believe 2012 will be a banner year for innovation, and judging from the range of significant new products we've launched so far this year, I stand by that statement. You may recall the long list of products we launched in Q1, including the TRACE 1300 gas chromatograph, the new iCAP Q ICP mass spec and our next-generation portable Raman instrument, the TruNarc. I'm pleased to report that we're seeing very good customer uptake from these products.", "We continued our innovation streak in Q2, with a number of launches at 2 important industry conferences for us, ASMS and ACHEMA. Let me give you a few of the highlights. First, I'll cover ASMS, which as most of you know, is the world's premiere gathering of scientists who are interested in learning how the latest mass spec technologies can accelerate their work. It's always a terrific opportunity for us to showcase our industry-leading offering, specifically our Orbitrap hybrid platform, which remains far and above the industry standard.", "We launched our Q Exactive system a year ago, and it continues to hit the ball out of the park for our research customers. This year, we enhanced the capabilities of this flagship instrument by launching 3 next-generation software packages that help our customers fully leverage the power of the Q Exactive in key applications from research to applied markets. These are among the 8 software packages we introduced at ASMS.", "In terms of new instruments, we launched the Exactive Plus LC/MS system for laboratory customers who need to perform high-volume screening in a range of applications from metabolomics to environmental analysis and food safety testing. The beauty of the Exactive Plus is that it can be readily upgraded to match the higher performance of the Premiere Q Exactive. We also introduced the new triple quad at ASMS, the TSQ 8000, so customers can view targeted compounds at much lower concentrations. This is especially relevant for food safety and environmental testing applications.", "Turning to ACHEMA, which took place in late June, we showcased a range of products designed to help customers meet their productivity goals, whether they're working in pharma and biotech, petrochemical or applied markets. The headliner at ACHEMA was our new iS50 FT-IR Spectrometer, the first research-grade FT-IR instrument designed for simple one-touch operation. The iS50 combines accessory, software and our industry-leading FT-IR capabilities to create a powerful workforce instrument capable of extracting vast amounts of information from a wide range of samples. If you look at all of the new product launches so far this year, you'll see that we've had a significant new development in almost every one of our core analytical instrument platforms. We look forward to updating you on new developments in the balance of the year, as well as the customer uptake of new technologies we've launched in the past few months.", "We've also strengthened our customer offering by deploying capital on strategic M&A. In May, we announced our acquisition of Doe & Ingalls, a premiere channel for specialty production chemicals and supply chain services for the life sciences industry. Doe & Ingalls strengthens our value proposition by adding products and services that address the production market within our customer base, which our channel has historically served from a research perspective. We now have the ability to help our customers manage risk, quality and total cost in our chemical supply chain to support their production needs.", "You all probably saw our announcement last week about our agreement to acquire One Lambda, the global leader in transplant diagnostics. We believe it will be an excellent addition to our Specialty Diagnostics portfolio because it will enhance our leadership with strong technologies that generate high margins and create opportunities for long-term growth. One Lambda has great technology. Its human leucocyte antigen and antibody tests are designed to improve the success rate for transplant patients. It's a nice complement to our immunosuppressant assays for monitoring drugs in transplant patients and gives us a comprehensive offering for the transplant testing workflow. We're also excited about being able to leverage our strength in emerging markets to accelerate One Lambda's penetration there. We expect the transaction to close in Q4. Both of these acquisitions are good use of our capital and meet all of our acquisition criteria. They strengthen our strategic position. They expand our offering for our customers, and they create value for our shareholders.", "Our capital deployment strategy also includes returning capital to our shareholders. Including the $100 million we spent to buy back our stocks in Q2, we have repurchased 400 million of our shares during the first half of this year. Last week, we announced an incremental buyback authorization of \t$500 million. If you add that to the $250 million we have remaining at the end of Q2, we have a total of $750 million available for buying back our stock in the second half of the year.", "Before I turn it over to Pete, let me give you a high-level view of our full year guidance. In thinking about our guidance halfway through the year, we went into it with a view that our end markets are playing out pretty much as we have expected, and strong execution by our teams has delivered very good financial performance. Our guidance reflects the addition of Doe & Ingalls, as well as our decision to divest our laboratory workstations business. It also incorporates somewhat more unfavorable FX rates. I'll let Pete get into the details, but the net result is that we now expect to achieve revenue between $12.14 billion and $12.26 billion in 2012. This results in 5% to 6% revenue growth year-over-year, which is the same growth that we've guided to all year. On the bottom line, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $4.74 to $4.84, which would lead to 14% to 16% EPS growth over 2011.", "So let me summarize what I believe are the key takeaways from an outstanding quarter. The world has played out as we expected, and our teams executed very well, setting the right growth priorities while tightly managing costs. Our growth initiatives continue to deliver results, especially in new products and emerging markets. We complimented those activities with strategic M&A, and we look forward  to adding One Lambda to our Specialty Diagnostics portfolio. All of this added up to a strong first half, and that positions us very well to deliver on our goals for the full year.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Similar to last quarter, I'm going to start with an overview of the total company's financial performance, and then I'll provide some color on each of our 3 segments before moving on to our updated guidance. As Marc mentioned, we moved our laboratory workstations business to discontinued operations effective with Q2 reporting. So all the continuing operations numbers I'm going to share with you today have been revised to exclude this business from both current and prior periods.", "As Marc said, our strong financial results this quarter were driven by really solid execution by our teams. This led to another quarter of double-digit growth in adjusted EPS, with a 23% increase to a second quarter record of $1.22. GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.63, down 54% from $1.36 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of the gain on divestitures last year. GAAP EPS includes a $0.02 operating loss in the laboratory workstations business. So we would have reported $0.02 lower adjusted EPS and 21% growth have we not discontinued this business. Still a great quarter.", "Starting with the top line. Total revenue increased 9% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for the second quarter in 2011, reported revenue was up 1%, and organic revenue was up 4%. Pro forma revenue included 1% growth from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia, which was more than offset by a 3% headwind from foreign currency translation. Please note that the components of the change in revenue do not sum due to rounding. We continue to strengthen our backlog with bookings exceeding revenue by $15 million or about 0.5%.", "Looking at revenue by geography, our growth profile was pretty consistent with what we've been seeing for the past few quarters. North America and Europe grew in the low-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low-double digits, with China coming in strong once again at over 20% growth, and the rest of world grew in the low-single digits. Turning to adjusted operating income,our teams once again delivered strong bottom line results. Q2 adjusted operating income was up 16%, reflecting great execution. Adjusted operating margin was up 19% or 110 basis points. Our margin expansion was driven by good pull-through on our organic growth, strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions and solid accretion from recent acquisitions.  Similar to the last couple of quarters, inflation on resin and other oil-based products continues to be a minor headwind, but we continue to deliver on our sourcing efforts and more than offset these pressures.", "As I mentioned last quarter, we continue to see the benefit of the $100 million restructuring program that we initiated last year and realized about $16 million of benefit in the quarter. As a reminder, we expect to achieve about $50 million of benefit this year and an incremental $15 million in 2013. We're also evaluating additional restructuring actions and continuing to maintain tight controls on our spending, given the uncertainty in some of our end markets.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L. As a reminder, the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions both have higher-than-average gross margins, as well as higher-than-average SG&A and R&D expense. So until they anniversary, you'll continue to see that impact in our year-over-year margins. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44.7% in Q2, up 210 basis points from the prior year for another strong quarter of gross margin expansion. The improvement in gross margin came as a result of solid productivity, driven by global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system in addition to the benefit from acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 22.6% of revenue, up 80 basis points from the 2011 quarter, primarily as a result of acquisitions. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3% of revenues, up 10 basis points year-over-year, again, as a result of acquisitions. Below the line, net interest expense was the same as last quarter at $51 million, which was $18 million above Q2 last year as a result of the debt we issued last year to fund the acquisitions. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.2%, down slightly from Q1 and down 280 basis points from last year, primarily as result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax planning efforts.", "During the quarter, we deployed another $100 million of cash to buy back 2 million shares of our stock, and average diluted shares were $369 million in the quarter, down $1 million from Q1 and down $17 million or 4% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2011 and 2012 share buybacks.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We had excellent cash flow this quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $909 million, and free cash flow was $782 million year-to-date after deducting net capital expenditures of $127 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 38% year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher income, lower cash taxes and improved working capital, partially offset by higher interest expense. We ended the quarter with about $735 million in cash and investments, down $56 million from Q1, primarily as a result of paying down some of our outstanding commercial paper, and our total debt at the end of Q2 was $6.5 billion, down $143 million from Q1.", "So with that, let me turn to this quarter's performance by each of our 3 segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies, total revenue grew 8%. On a pro forma basis, assuming Dionex was owned for the full quarter in the prior year, Analytical Technologies' total revenue increased 1% and organic revenue growth was 5%. Consistent with last quarter, we saw strong growth in instruments sold to industrial and applied markets, as well as in our businesses serving BioProcess Production. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 40 basis points. Margin expansion was driven by strong pull-through on organic growth and contribution from our productivity actions, partially offset by strategic investments, inflation and product mix.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Total revenue grew 28%. On a pro forma basis, assuming Phadia was owned in the second quarter of the prior year, total revenue increased 1% and organic revenue grew 3%. Also consistent with last quarter, we continue to see strong growth in clinical diagnostics, which was partially offset by weak demand in Southern Europe. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 47%, with adjusted operating margin at 27.2%, up 340 basis points, primarily as a result of acquisitions. In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, total revenue grew 2% and organic revenue increased by 4%. In the quarter, we had solid growth in Laboratory Consumables, and our Clinical Trials Logistics business continued to deliver strong results. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 1%, with adjusted operating margin coming in at 14.2%. This was 30 basis points below the year-ago quarter, but up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1, so we're continuing to increase profitability in this segment.", "Now moving on to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our 2012 guidance to reflect classification of the laboratory workstations business as a discontinued operation, the acquisition of Doe & Ingalls and more unfavorable foreign currency exchange. The bridge from the midpoint of our previous guidance, removing lab work stations and lower FX rates, reduced revenue by about $185 million and $40 million, respectively, offset by about $75 million of additional revenue from Doe & Ingalls. Combined with our solid first half results, this leads to a new revenue guidance range of $12.14 billion to $12.26 billion, which represents reported growth of 5% to 6% compared to our prior year revenue of $11.56 billion.", "On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for all of the prior year, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance remains at about 3%, no change from our previous guidance. In terms of FX, the estimated full year impact is increased to $365 million, which results in a 3% headwind on our reported revenue and adjusted EPS, and we're assuming that completed acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia will contribute approximately 1% to our expected growth in 2012. We also recently announced the acquisition of One Lambda and an additional $500 million share buyback authorization, along with an expected debt issuance of $1.3 billion to fund these 2 activities. We've not included any benefit from One Lambda in our guidance as we don't expect to close that acquisition until Q4. However, we have included the favorable impact of the share buyback and the unfavorable impact of interest expense related to prefunding the acquisition debt. As usual, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign exchange rates, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "In terms of our full year 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, with the strong first half of the year under our belt and with the impact of these actions that I just described, we're raising the high and low ends of our guidance, as well as tightening the range, resulting in a $0.02 increase to the midpoint. Our revised adjusted EPS guidance range is $4.74 to $4.84, which represents 14% to 16% growth over 2011. To again bridge from the midpoint of our previous guidance, Doe & Ingalls adds about $0.02, and there's another $0.02 increase from the net impact of the share buyback and debt issuance. This $0.04 increase is offset by $0.02 of negative pull-through on the more unfavorable foreign currency translation.", "In terms of adjusted operating margin, we're still expecting expansion of 70 to 90 basis points for the year. And below the line, we're expecting our net interest expense to be up about $70 million to $75 million over last year and up about $15 million versus our previous guidance as a result of the expected new debt issuance, and our adjusted income tax rate to remain in the range of 17% to 18%.", "We're estimating our full year average diluted share count to be in the range of 364 million to 368 million, down 4% to 5% from last year, and down 1% from our previous range due to the additional share buyback authorization. This estimate assumes that we use the remaining $750 million of our current share buyback authorization through December of this year. Finally, we're assuming that we'll deploy $150 million towards dividends this year and we expect capital expenditures to be the range of $300 million and $310 million. In interpreting our guidance ranges, as I've stated previously, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2012 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the balance of the year. So before we turn to Q&A, let me say that I'm very pleased to report an excellent second quarter and a strong first half of the year that positions us very well to meet our growth goals in 2012. Ken?", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Operator, we are ready to take calls.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So first, I want to -- I really appreciate all the color that you gave, Marc, but I wondered if you could talk a little bit more -- unless I missed it, you didn't say much about the U.S. and before we've been talking about a bit of a slowing in U.S. I'm just curious kind of what you're seeing specifically in the U.S. and what your outlook there is for the second half of the year.", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Jon, U.S. was slightly stronger than the first quarter, but not materially so. So U.S. is hanging in there with low-single digit organic growth.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And is that the expectation for the second half as well?", "Marc N. Casper", "As we look at the second half, basically, when we started the year, we looked at organic growth being around 3% for the full year. We have -- staying with that guidance, so we had 4% first half organic growth, so that implies a 2% organic growth in the second half, and that basically implies a little bit of a slow down. But that's more likely to be in the U.S. and Western Europe than it is really in Asia-Pacific. So it's probably slightly slow in the second half, but we don't really forecast by geography. We typically forecast by our businesses.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Sure, I understand. And then the second, as a follow-up on that, I think you both kind of mentioned the past restructuring, but also same, like given the environment, is very uncertain. So considering maybe doing more, can you maybe just talk about, one, what the trigger would be for that and two, what that would entail on your end?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, the way that we think about it is we're always looking at our cost base, right? And that last year, we specifically put in $100 million program that we've been executing against. But in addition to that, we've been looking at selective cost actions, and those programs are not -- those actions that makes sense and have the right result for the mid-  and long-term health of the business. We're taking those actions as we go. So it's probably incremental to it, but it's not under the banner of some incremental programs. It is more good management of the business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So as far back as I can remember, at least, since you've taken over, Marc, this was probably the best quarter organically you had versus peers. As you look at sort of the components of where you saw strength, and I know you probably haven't had much time to check out all the earnings reports like we do. But I guess relative to either your internal expectations based on what you're seeing in the macro, based on what you had heard or throughout the quarter regionally, products, specific, et cetera, where do you feel like the biggest out-performance was for the business in the environment?", "Marc N. Casper", "So Ross, thanks for the question. Welcome back to the conference call. A couple of things. Actually, if you look at the results, and we do actually look at all of those reports, and we do read all of the competitor reports pretty much realtime. Actually, this quarter is actually very consistent to the last 2 quarters. So 3 quarters in a row, our organic growth has been very strong relative to the peer set. So I actually think you're seeing a nice consistent trend of us delivering very strong organic growth, 5% in Q4, 4% in Q1, 4% in Q2 and relative to the share gain initiatives we had. But I'd say where do I feel -- I think the teams are executing extraordinarily well. They're very focused on -- we have great products and are very focused on serving our customer needs. Our value proposition is incredibly relevant in today's environment, right?  Our customers are living in a tougher world. They need productivity. They understand our scale. They understand our depth of capabilities. We've been at this for 5 years in terms of -- since the merger in building those capabilities and you're seeing us harvesting those hard work, and it's showing up in our organic growth results. So it's less about a particular geography or a particular product, it's really about a value proposition that resonates in today's environment. We feel great about it.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe on the guidance increase on EPS, obviously, I think that's not something we've seen from many businesses in this environment, given the macro backdrop and what we saw in -- through the June time frame. And so as you guys were sort of debating the forecast and we're looking at sort of early trends in July, how comfortable were you? Or how did you think about sort of how aggressive you wanted to get with sort of the guidance move vis-\u00e0-vis sort of the bigger picture and what other large corporates were doing with their outlooks? And then I have sort of a clean-up question on that as well.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So Ross, in terms of guidance, the world isn't playing out, at least, the first half as we expected and articulated in February, right, when we set out our original guidance. So we expected Europe to get weaker as the year went on. We expected sequestration would not get resolved during this year. We factored those things into our guidance. So when you think about us sitting with good execution at the first half, and the world playing out as we laid out back at the beginning of the year, we don't see a big change in those expectations. When you look at the various actions that we've taken, we've kept the organic growth guidance the same, and which means that we are -- we have a couple of points deceleration in the second half, which is a cushion if you will, right, versus the way we've been trending. But we think that's realistic, given the market outlook. And when you look at the fact that we're doing an incremental buyback, you look at the fact that we closed a nice acquisition in Doe & Ingalls, those things are net positives even offsetting the headwinds from FX. So the $0.02 increase to the midpoint is, we think, a good reflection. And we always focus on the midpoint of our guidance, so we feel like the low end protects for a much more challenging world if it unfolds.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And just one quick cleanup on the guidance. I know One Lambda is clearly not in there from a revenue EBIT perspective. But just to be clear, there is a bit of interest expense assumption in there or not to you?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, we added about $15 million of interest and that's to prefund the acquisition, as well as to fund the share buyback.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So that will happen at some point in 3 or 4Q, I'm assuming?", "Peter M. Wilver", "It will happen some time probably in the third quarter in terms of the debt issuance.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Vamil Divan from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I guess, I just have a couple of questions here more related to what you're seeing kind of sequentially through the course of the quarter, heard some comments from other companies in terms of April through May through June. Have you seen any significant trends kind of through the course of the quarter or into July that give you any cause for -- that things are getting better or worse in any way?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, we looked at that. And when we do our guidance, we factor in through the first 2 weeks of the quarter that we're living in as well. So we feel that the guidance that we've given is reflecting those trends. We didn't see big changes in June or anything that would lead us to believe of a very different trend and a change in trend or trajectory. So fairly consistent throughout the quarter.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay, and then just one other one if I could with -- in terms of the -- I know you guys don't give beyond in terms of quarters, looking forward the rest of the year, but you've been getting a lot of questions just in terms of how the fourth quarter might play out with all the questions on sequestration and what's going on in Washington. Any guidance you can kind of give just even more qualitatively in terms of how you expect kind of third quarter versus fourth quarter. Just looking at the numbers right now, it looks like we're still seeing difference [ph] in terms of growth expectations over the third versus the fourth quarter?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So in terms of our quarterly phasing, just seasonally, Q3 is always a relatively weak quarter just because of the vacations in Europe and really around the world, I guess, and Q4 is always our strongest quarter in terms of the year-end push on instrumentation, so probably slightly stronger in Q4. But all that depends a little bit on what happens with sequestration.", "Operator", "Your next question is from that line of Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I wanted to ask a question on the lab products in terms of business. Second quarter in a row, solid organic growth there versus some peers pointing to more challenging environment. Can you just provide some color regarding the strength you're seeing there and the kind of the sustainability of those trends?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. When I look at lab products and services, we saw another good quarter in our Biopharma Services. The clinical trials outsourcing business is doing well. Our channel business is also performing well. So we like the trajectory that we're on in our lab products and services segment.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Maybe related to that, the divestiture of the workstation business, can you just discuss kind of what kind of impact that had on the organic growth in the quarter?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, when you look at organic growth, we would have had as a company about 3.5% organic growth if lab workstations was in the numbers. And we had 4% organic growth with lab workstations out of the numbers. And we would have had $0.02 lower adjusted EPS if lab workstations was in the number versus what we did, as Pete highlighted. So the decision on lab workstation had nothing to do with any of that stuff. It was more a decision that we made as a management team that we really want the best owners for this business and decided that we were going to sell it to a business that could really help it thrive and grow for the future.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Marc, and maybe if I can just sneak one more in. The gross margin strength in the quarter, it was better than we had modeled. Could you just tease out the components? Certainly, Phadia and Dionex coming to the mix are helping margins like is it possible to quantify like Phadia and Dionex contribution versus cost cutting? And in particular, did the company accelerate any facilities closings or any other cost measures that would have led to better gross margin leverage in the quarter?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, so in terms of gross margins, certainly, the acquisitions benefited gross margins. That obviously is going to decrease in terms of the impact throughout the year as we anniversary those in Q2 -- or excuse me, Q3 Dionex will be fully out. And then Q4, both of them will be fully out. But the gross margin improvement is kind of on the core business is really coming from the areas that we continually drive productivity and which is sourcing our PPI business system and restructuring. And the benefit there, it's probably about 1/3, 1/3, 1/3 between those 3 in terms of improvement on the core business.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Two quick ones. First off, in lab products and services, now that you've divested or you're planning to divest the workstations business, how should we think about the margin trajectory of that business going forward? Is that a business where you could increase margins commensurate with the corporate average annually? Or will that still be more lumpy?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, I think in Laboratory Products and Services, it's lower than average, and we have the channel business there, which we don't have as much value-added cost that we can actually impact in terms of margin expansion. So there's a lot more direct material costs in that segment. So that segment, over time, will in general have lower-margin expansion than the average for the company just as a result of that.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then housekeeping, Pete. What are the foreign currency rates you're using in your guidance versus the euro?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, so for the euro, it's about 121.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to just have you, Marc, elaborate on your comments on the CapEx budget releases within academic government. Can you give us a little bit more detail under the types of products that are being impacted and tie in what you're seeing within mass spec in the competitive environment?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So academic and government really didn't change very much, didn't really change at all in Q2. Consumables, broadly did fine, which means it's logical, right? Customers, they're working, right, so they're doing research, so therefore, they're consuming plastics, reagents and so forth. Instrumentation really was more aligned with how differentiated the technologies were. So in particular, our mass spec business had a very nice quarter. But things like lab, equipment and more routine instrumentation would be -- would really be a little bit softer and more constrained.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And the second part for my question is on the Analytical Technologies. You highlighted Biopharma within Analytical Technologies as a strength in the past. This quarter, I don't think Pete brought that one up, but you did talk about Biopharma strength overall. Can you talk specifically about Analytical Technologies, anything going on there that we should be aware of?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, within Analytical Technologies, we have our BioProcess Production business, which had another terrific quarter. That was there, I would say, on the instrument side of the business, so it was kind of an okay quarter in terms of Biopharma. It was up, but it was not probably as strong as some other quarters.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Anything regionally that's impacting that or is it just across-the-board?", "Marc N. Casper", "I didn't really see any particular regional explanation. I think, generally, Europe was pretty soft.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So you guys have previously talked about something like 50% of free cash flow back to the shareholder dividends and repurchases. Obviously, you're going to do a lot more than that this year. But just wondering, should we think about a different rule of thumb going forward specifically in '13 just given the leverage ratio post the One Lambda deal, meaning, is deleveraging a greater priority for '13 at this point?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think when we get to -- we'll do that really in the February guidance. I mean, at a high level, our capital deployment strategy hasn't changed, which is a portion of our capital is going to get returned to our shareholders. A portion is going to be used for M&A that meets our strict criteria and in any given year may vary based on the environment. We're comfortable with our leverage ratios hovering between 2.5 and 3 at year-end. They should be relatively close to 2.5, so I don't -- I wouldn't assume major changes in the capital deployment strategy for '13, but we'll figure that out and communicate it crystal-clear in February.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. Marc, one last one. Any view on the timing of Hamilton divestiture? And anything you've -- it looks like you've written the book value down to  close to 0, is that accurate? And would you expect to get any material proceeds there?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of the divestiture process, it's ongoing. In terms of the gains and losses, I don't want to speculate on that because I want to wait til we actually have the buyer negotiate, and I don't want to handicap or really comment on the valuation. But I think the write-down is a reflection of what we think was an appropriate accounting at the point of time of the decision to divest it.", "Peter M. Wilver", "It is above 0 though.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Maybe just building off of that last question, I think the conclusion has been you've done a good job divesting businesses when you think about Athena and Lancaster last year and certainly the one you're in the process of divesting makes sense. Could you just describe what the environment is like for these opportunities? And maybe more importantly, what's the criteria you're going to use moving forward to make divestiture decisions? Is it simply a question of in your words whether or not you're the best owner for an asset? Or is there something we can also look at in terms of size, margin profile, growth rate, any other criteria that you would be willing to share with us?", "Marc N. Casper", "Doug, so we're not contemplating any material divestiture. So if you want to define material, anything nearly as large as lab workstations. So we always do tiny little things and we'll continue to do that. But we like the portfolio. Our strategy is clearly working when you look at the organic growth that we're delivering over the last few quarters. That's because the package of businesses we have today fit together, work together and are valued by the customers. So I wouldn't expect really much more on the divestiture front. And if you think about it, you go back over the last 5 years, the ones we've divested are very logical and they've been telegraphed, if you will. We've never liked competing with our customers, so we sold our 2 testing labs, which is Athena Lancaster. And lab workstations has been a business that is a very heavy manufacturing business. It's very different than what we do. And when we look at the long-term fit, we think there are companies that have a better ownership with it than we would.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So if I have it right, it looks like restructuring expense picked up a little bit, Q1 to Q2. Was this as planned, assuming I have this right, or was it in response to anything that you're seeing in the environment? Or is there anything else that caused this to accelerate that was different than planned?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So we obviously put whether the $100 million restructuring plan last year, and we've been executing against that throughout the year. We're always doing some level of restructuring actions in addition to that. As Marc said, it's not kind of at the program level, it's more the one-offs, so I wouldn't necessarily read anything into that other than just normal actions that we do throughout the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And last one, you continue to pick up shares, the numbers suggests and as you mentioned in your prepared remarks, some of this is easy to see via new products in Analytical Technologies like Q Exactive. But beyond specific new product launches, are you evolving how you go-to-market with products, how you sell products within Analytical Technologies? In our channel checks and our conversations with some of your competitors, we're starting to hear more about Thermo doing a better job selling applications-wide solutions, if you will, really connecting different products and services across your analytical technology product portfolio? Is there something that's changing in terms of how you commercialize customer solutions? And if so, how far along are you in this process?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's a good comment, not much more to add, Doug. I like the feedback. I would say it's an area that we're focused on, and I think we're doing a better and better job of representing our solutions-based capabilities for our customers. And I still think we have a lot of work to do and a lot of opportunity ahead. So it's still young, if you will, but we've been working at it and our customers understand the value of it. I actually think when customers are more constrained and customers are trying to make sure they're successful, the broader your capabilities and the deeper your applications are, the better off you're going to be, and I think that's really paying off for us.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Actually, I want to kind of take a slightly different angle to Doug's last question there and this is really the second quarter in a row we've seen you outperform a lot of your equipment peers. Can you talk to how much of that is share gains versus other factors? We obviously, as Doug said, see it in mass spec. Are there other obvious areas where we should think about you pulling share? And then how much is pricing a factor in this environment, in particular, within mass spec?", "Marc N. Casper", "So there's no pure -- each company is a little bit different. So when we look at our mix of analytical technology, it's different than the other companies. I do think we have a good share gain in mass spec. I think our biosciences business is doing well and generally I view that the performance is strong. Pricing has -- was up slightly in the quarter, but it wasn't a big change from what we've seen. So I don't think price is a big factor one way or the other in the performance.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Just a couple of housekeeping ones. Is Phadia kind of back on track? That was a little bit soft last quarter. There was some seasonality there. Can you just talk to whether that's recovered?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so Tycho, let me give a more holistic update on both acquisitions that we are almost at the one year anniversary. I think it's a good question. It hasn't been asked. So when you think about Dionex, when you think about Phadia, let's look at it in the 3 criteria that we look at which is how is the integration going, how's the business performing short term or what's the long-term prospects. Integration for both businesses has gone extraordinarily well. It's Thermo Fisher, I mean, at this point, both of them. They're very well integrated. The culture is very harmonious, and it's very positive. Synergies are ahead of plan when you look at accretion, which is now the reflection of the full package or performance. In 2012, accretion is going to be better for both of those acquisitions than the acquisition model. Phadia, in particular, will be very meaningfully more accretive than we articulated back on the $0.30 that we had talked about. When you look at the short-term performance of the business, both businesses actually have more European exposure than the company average. So both of them actually are growing slightly less than the company average in terms of organic growth. But if I look at the longer-term prospects for both businesses, we're very, very bullish on what both bring to our company and feel good about it. So generally feel good, but European exposure hasn't been particularly helpful.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and then last one. I know you've a number of questions on Hamilton, not to spend too much time on it, but I mean if we go back years and years ago, this was always viewed as a bad business. I think you and I used joke the competition was 2 guys in a sauce. So it hasn't gotten better over the years presumably. Why did it take so long to divest it? I mean, was there a period where you thought you could actually really truly turn it around?", "Marc N. Casper", "We have a terrific team of employees in that business, and they work very hard to make it the very best business that it can, and we gave them significant resources to try to make the most of it. And when we look at it today, we just think there are companies that it's more core to their activities than ours and we decided that that's right thing, so it's a decision. It's a tough business but at the same point, we think it has good prospects, and we think the right owner will bring it to its full potential.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Derek De Vries from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So you're -- in Q3, you're going to anniversary the weak academic environment that hit you last September. Since comps get easier, I guess, what's kind of built into your academic numbers? Are you still expecting academic to be down year-over-year or is it more flat? I'm just kind of wondering how you're -- where are you on that thought process?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when you look at the comps, industrial gets harder both in Q3 and Q4 and obviously in academic, the comparison is easier. When we laid out our guidance, we obviously don't do quarterly guidance. When we laid out our guidance, we assumed that academic and government would be down low-single digits for the year. It's down low-single digits in the first half, and that sort of implies that it's going to be still down off of an easy comp. I mean, that would be what the math would imply, although, we're not -- we don't really sit down and say what's Q3 exactly going to be versus Q4 but hopefully, that helps you think about modeling.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, that's very helpful. So you've gotten beaten up in the past in your LPS business because organic growth lagged. Now that you've divested it, I know that you're planning to divest it. It's been 0.5% drag in your overall organic growth rate in Q2. But can you just give us a flavor of what it has been historically as a drag on the LPS segment?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of lab workstations, in particular?", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes, lab workstations, what was the drag on the overall LPS business? Because when the focus has been that business had not -- it did not grow as fast as it had previously thought, and I'm just wondering if this was a bigger -- if it's the large reason why that business have not done as well in the past?", "Peter M. Wilver", "The results in 2011 were relatively weak, but the numbers are so small that the accretion dilution on both organic growth and the margins is pretty minimal. For this year, it didn't really even affect our guidance taking the numbers out, so it wasn't so materially off of the averages that it was making a big impact.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I mean, I think, Derek, you know us well enough and following this stuff which is it's not going -- it's not big enough to make a material change, but it was the right decision to sell it, so we're selling it. But we're not sitting here and trying to change the gross rate by 0.10 point one way or another. It's just -- in the scheme of things, it doesn't make a difference.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Right. No, that's right. And then finally, can you just give us some more color on Asia? Is the growth you're seeing there share gains from peers? For example, the multinationals that you're selling to, are you just getting better share there? Are you taking share? Or is it brand new business from domestic Chinese or Asian customers that are showing up? Can you just give us a little bit of flavor of where you're seeing your growth and how that's working?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so let's focus on China. China was very strong in excess of 20% of growth organically again. When you look at it, we had very good performance widely across the business, and I think a nice example is we talked about the 5-year plan and the focus on healthcare, the focus on environment, so it's not a surprise that our Specialty Diagnostics business is doing very well and growing rapidly in China, in particular, because basically there's a big healthcare availability opportunity in China, where they're trying to create more capacity, if you will, to serve the population. The other area that's doing incredibly well in China is our environmental business. There is regulations called PM2.5, which is basically breathing in particulates in your lungs, and the government has actually decided to accelerate on implementation of those regulations, and we're capturing about 70% share of all of the air monitors that are being used for that particular application. So it's really -- it's not taking share from the New York Stock Exchange listed competitors, taking share from companies that might be local or really, we don't think as much about. So the business is performing very well, and we continue to be optimistic about our outlook in China in particular.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias from UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Marc, I guess, just given the focus on cost control these days, curious whether you can give us a sense of where you think the biggest need to spend is in order to keep innovation where it needs to be and to keep people in the right places? Can you just update us on your current view on investment focus?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I mean, I think the investment focus is straightforward. We're going to continue to support our R&D efforts, and we're going to continue to expand in emerging markets. Those are clear. We'll also make commercial investments around the applications marketing as Doug asked earlier, some things on the website, things that continue to strengthen the company. We will manage our costs tightly on all other areas, right? So we're being prudent and frugal on those other things, so making sure that we're as efficient as we can and looking for opportunities to streamline our cost base.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just a follow-up. I'm wondering if you can comment a bit more on applied market demand. Some reports elsewhere have maybe some potential slowing in food and environmental testing areas. Is that something that showed up anywhere for you guys at all?", "Marc N. Casper", "Nothing that really jumped out from our material perspective one way or the other. We continue to have good momentum in our applied markets.", "Operator", "And that question will come from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to ask a general question on pricing. I think you guys mentioned in the earlier comments that pricing generally, not a big swing factor, but if you could maybe add a little bit of color in diagnostics and then in pharma. I think in diagnostics, we're clearly dealing with pretty stagnant volume environment and the lab companies have generally suggested they're going to look to try and save expenses. So what are you seeing in the diagnostics channel with regards to your basic supply side of the franchise? And then in pharma, some of these larger contracts, just wondering what kind of a tone you see on pricing there?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, in terms of pricing in diagnostics, I mean, that's not an area where we generally get a lot of price. So that's consistent with the past. It's basically flat overall. I don't have a lot of data by market segment in relation to the price, but in overall, it's about flat.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then in pharma?", "Marc N. Casper", "In pharma, again, we don't cut the business that way. I would say that probably the takeaway message on pricing in Q2 was pretty similar to what we saw in Q1 in aggregate and not really any major changes that we observed. So we pay a lot of attention to it. Obviously, we have a very high focus on pricing. We generally do a good job with it, so -- but we're not seeing anything, Isaac, that on the upside or downside that's material.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "That's helpful and just one last one for me on China, I know mentioned earlier the comments on the environmental business. But if we look at the economics side, there were some questions elsewhere in the industry about phasing on government funds, getting released over the course of this year, any update and commentary on that part of the China end market?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, when we look at China, we've been consistently growing north of 20%. And really, there wasn't major swings one way or the other within the business. So we feel good about the overall performance in China, and actually feel good about the outlook as well.  So Isaac, thank you.", "Let me just wrap up the call and add a few quick closing thoughts. One is that I think our team's executed very well to deliver a strong first half. Their focus on new products, emerging markets and strategic acquisitions is clearly driving growth. We continue to manage our costs tightly in line with the economic environment, and we're confident that we'll deliver on our growth goals for the year. Thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and we look forward to updating you on our Q3 call. Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your presentation.

My name is Tamina [ph] and I will be your operator for today. At this time all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. (Operator instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Eileen Pattinson, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed, ma\u2019am.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, Tamina, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call.", "Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer and Bernd Brust, our Chief Commercial Officer are available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the Company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen, and thanks to all of you for joining us. I hope you\u2019ve had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth and we are pleased with how we have started 2010.", "Revenue grew 10% organically to $887 million, a result of terrific growth in both instruments and consumables. Operating margins expanded by 330 basis points to hit a record 29.5%. And earnings per share grew 21% to $0.87 for the quarter. This quarter marks the 14th quarter in a row that this Company has met or exceeded its financial targets on both the top and the bottom line. This milestone demonstrates how seriously we take our commitments to our shareholders. Our teams around the world have proven that they know how to put their heads down and get the work done, driving above market revenue growth with a relentless focus on execution.", "As I do every quarter, I will take a few moments now to talk about these results in the context of our strategic imperatives delivering on the integration, realizing the potential of this new Company, and investing for the future. First, we made significant progress on our integration goals for the year. The sales force reorganization is complete and our reps are hitting the street with a singular purpose of adding value for our customers. Our ultimate goal is to become their partner of choice by providing unparalled customer service, and offering an expansive portfolio of innovative products that simplify and streamline entire workflows.", "In addition, we announced the closure of two manufacturing site in Camarillo, California, and Bromborough, UK. The work to consolidate these operations into our facilities in Frederick, Maryland and Warrington in the UK is well underway and going successfully. These initiatives, as well as many others will generate an additional $20 million in annualized synergies. This brings us one step closer to our goal of putting action plans in place that will generate an additional $70 million in annualized savings by the end of this year.", "Our diligence [ph] approach to the integration has not only paid off from a near term synergy perspective, but has set us up for success in other important ways. In particular, we\u2019ve made great strides in realizing the potential of the new Company, which is our second strategic imperative. Let me now share with you some ways in which we optimize the value of our combined Company in the first quarter.", "As I mentioned, we grew revenue 10% organically. Regionally, Japan was a standup performer with 23% growth for the quarter. Throughout 2009 our team in Japan executed on a strategy to optimize our commercial structure in the region. Among other actions, we increased the number of sales reps in the field and implemented a new dealer strategy that more closely aligned incentives with performance. These efforts position us well to take advantage of the additional research funding that the Japanese government released in the first quarter of 2010. As a result, we had strong sales across all of our businesses in Japan with a notable increase in sales of the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and the Neon Transfection system.", "Growth in Japan was also positively impacted from a lift in realized price and recognition of the last installment from the landmark police forensics deal. We are very pleased with this performance and recognize the tremendous efforts that our team in Japan is putting forth. However, this remains a very challenging region, and we expect growth to be in the low-single digits for the balance of the year now.", "The Americas region grew 8% in the quarter with stimulus-related revenues contributing approximately 3% of this growth. While we did not see a significant ramp up in stimulus revenues for the fourth quarter, we are still confident \u2013 from the fourth quarter, we are still confident in our estimate of greater than $100 million over the life of this federal program. However, because of the slow ramp up in stimulus related spending, we believe that more of this revenue might now push into 2011 than we had originally anticipated", "I\u2019d like to now talk a bit about our last strategic priority, investing for future growth. As I\u2019ve stated in the past, we expect to grow revenue one to two points faster than the market for the foreseeable future. One of the ways in which we will achieve this goal is the consistent introduction of new and innovative products. It is critical to have an eye on the future and anticipate the areas that will drive growth in the months and the years to come.", "To that end, we have spent considerable efforts fine-tuning our innovation techniques over the last 24 months and focus our efforts on several key areas, including genetic sequencing, synthetic biology, flow cytometry, benchtop devices, and PCR. In addition to meeting the needs of our research customers, investments in these areas will increasingly move us into higher growth in commercial and clinical realms.", "We will go into more detail about our investment strategies at our upcoming investor day in June, but I will give you a few highlights of some of our recent product introductions now.", "Yesterday, we issued a press release about the debut of the industry\u2019s first benchtop proteomic and epigenetic sample preparation system, the MAGic Sample Processor. In line with our strategy of offering innovative products that simplify and streamline workflows, this new device cuts protocol times in half and dramatically reduces experimental errors by automating manual processes. MAGic utilizes microfluidics, thermal controls, and integrated magnetic separation technology, which enables researchers to more easily perform technically challenging experiments in protein purification and epigenetics.", "We are particularly excited about this launch as it is another product in a growing line of innovative, productivity-enhancing benchtop devices. And I might add, it combines the very best of Life Technologies\u2019 engineering, Dynal bead technology, and our consumables channel [ph]. It is a product that couldn\u2019t have been created without the creating of Life Technologies.", "In addition to the launch of MAGic, last week at the America Association for Cancer Research, we unveiled several new technologies, including research only KRAS and BRAF mutation analysis reagents that can be analyzed using the 3500 Genetic Analyzer.", "We also announced our newest innovation in real-time PCR, the ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System. The ViiA 7 System offers maximum productivity, ease of use, and instrument to instrument consistency. While the ViiA 7 System is currently for research use only, it was designed with clinical applications in mind. We expect to get a CE IVD mark later in the year and ultimately plan for 510(k) in the U.S. Gaining these clearances will extend the application of the ViiA 7 System beyond research lab and into clinical and diagnostic markets. The launch of the ViiA 7 System is part of our broader strategy to extend our leadership position in PCR by setting new technology standards. We began executing upon this strategy in 2009 when we acquired Cytonix for intellectual property related to digital PCR technology and then followed that with the acquisition of BioTrove for its OpenArray platform, enabling high throughput traditional genotyping into PCR as well as digital PCR reads.", "Today, I am pleased to announce the acquisition of Stokespile [ph] whose ground-breaking technology redefines the current play-safe paradigm for the PCR process, generating orders of magnitude more date in less time. Stokespile has developed the microfluidics based system for high throughput, highly flexible genotyping, gene expression analysis, and digital PCR. This technology is well-suited to meet the ever-growing demand for higher throughput genomic analysis in agriculture, drug discovery, translational research, and other applications being fuelled by the rapid rate of discovery from next generation sequencing systems such as ours. The acquisition of Stokespile is another very exciting step forward as we continue to build out and redefine the PCR industry.", "These combined assets will enable our vision of delivering (inaudible) performance and quality, fast, easy, and configured for customer throughput and flexibility needs. Building out our PCR franchise through both internal development and the acquisition of technologies is just one example of how we are investing in our future. We have programs in place that will ultimately drive our business forward and it\u2019s a smart and efficient allocation of resources to these programs that will set us up for success in the years to come.", "With that, I will turn it over to David who will provide a little more color on our divisional performance and overall financial results. David?", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. This quarter we grew revenue 13% to $887 million. Currency had a positive four point impact on reported revenue growth and acquisitions and divestitures had a negative one point impact. Excluding the effect of currency, acquisitions, and divestitures, revenue grew 10% organically.", "This performance was the result of strong volume growth and better pricing in most areas of the business. In addition, growth was positively impacted by three items in particular. As Greg mentioned before, we recognized $8 million in revenue from the last installment of the Japanese police order. We also benefited from spending related to the supplemental budget in Japan which added $4 million in revenues.", "And finally, revenue associated with the NIH stimulus totaled $10 million. These three items added about 3% to the overall growth rate.", "Before I walk through some of divisional highlights, I\u2019d like to point out a relatively small change in our division structure that went into effect at the beginning of the year. In order to better align certain technologies within our divisions, we created a new business unit called Applied Molecular Testing, which is now part of the Molecular Biology Systems division. Going forward, all of our animal, biosecurity, food, and environmental testing products will be accounted for in this new business unit.", "In addition to this change, we moved certain products associated with our pharma analytics business from Genetic Systems to Cell Systems to more closely align our product offerings for pharmaceutical and biological production. As a result, product lines totaling approximately $50 million in revenue were moved between divisions. For year-over-year comparison purposes, we\u2019ve posted a worksheet on our website that restates divisional revenue for 2009. In addition, we will be providing more detail during the post earnings Q&A call later this afternoon.", "Now, I will get into the divisional highlights. Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 10% organically to $432 million in revenue. Our PCR business grew in the teens, driven by particularly strong demand for instruments in the Americas and Asia as well as the Japanese police order that I referenced earlier. Genomic Assays also performed well with double-digit growth in the Americas, Asia-Pacific, and Japan. Lastly, the Molecular Biology Reagent business benefited from strong sales for reagents in all regions.", "Genetic Systems grew 12% organically to $238 million. CE, our largest technology group in this division grew mid-single digits for the quarter, driven by growth in both consumables and instruments. Consumables continued to experience solid growth in research and applied applications. Instrument growth was driven by strong sales in clinical research, particularly for the newly launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer, partially offset by a year-over-year decline in instruments sold into applied markets due to a large sale in the first quarter of last year.", "And finally, we continue to gain traction in next generation sequencing as we improve the ease-of-use and the performance of the SOLiD platform. Ongoing improvements in the technology, new product launches such as the SOLiD PI system, along with investments in our field support sales teams and marketing are paying off. A good example of this is the British Columbia Cancer Agency\u2019s purchase of 10 SOLiD 4 units for their research. The accuracy of the SOLiD system is increasingly recognized by thought leaders as critical for cancer related research.", "Cell systems had revenues of $214 million, representing 8% organic growth. Growth in this division increased compared to prior quarters as pharmaceutical and biotech end markets started to improve. This quarter saw a double-digit growth in bioproduction, driven by new drug introductions, and the timing of large customer orders.", "Primary and stem cell systems also posted strong growth in the quarter, driven by demand for both media and reagents.", "And lastly, our Dynal beads based business grew in the double digits on large orders from molecular diagnostic customers.", "In terms of organic growth by region, the Americas grew 8%; Europe grew 5%, Asia-Pacific 25%, and Japan 23%.", "As I mentioned earlier, currency added four points of growth to revenue for the quarter, net of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately 7% or $0.07 including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue and other income.", "First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 68.3%, an increase of approximately 160 basis points over prior year. This improvement was primarily due to price, currency, synergies, and manufacturing productivity. On a sequential basis, gross margins increased by 330 basis points due to increases in price and royalty revenue and higher productivity in our plants. Keep in mind that gross margins in the fourth quarter are typically lower, so sequential increase was expected.", "First quarter operating expenses were $343 million, an increase over prior year levels of 8% with currency, and 6% without currency. Operating expenses increased due to increases in R&D, depreciation, and cost associated with employee stock options. Sequentially, operating expenses were relatively flat, mainly due to delaying some investments until we had a better understanding of how stimulus related revenues would flow in the quarter.", "Operating income was $262 million, an increase of 27% over prior year including the impact of currency, and 20% excluding currency. Operating margin was 29.5%, representing 330 basis points of improvement year-over-year, including the impact from currency. This level of operating margin expansion resulted from improved gross margins, synergies and other operating expense reductions. As we\u2019ve said before, our goal over the next several years is to consistently deliver 50 plus basis points of operating margin improvements.", "In terms of other income, we had $1 million of interest income, $3 million from currency gain, and $1 million of expense from our mass spec joint venture. Interest expense for the quarter was $30 million.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 30%, slightly higher than guidance due to the expiration of the federal R&D tax credit. We believe that this tax credit will be renewed at some time during the year. If renewed, the credit will reduce our full year tax rate by approximately one percentage point. Therefore, we expect our full year tax rate to be between 29% and 29.5%.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 190 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options. We continue to expect a full year diluted share count of 192 million to 194 million shares, assuming an average stock price for the year between $52 and $55 per share.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.48, which includes the gain of $0.14 per share on the sale of the mass spec division, $0.25 of acquisition related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1, $0.08 per share of business integration cost and other items, and $0.17 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost resulting from the early repayment of debt.", "On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share were $0.87, a 21% increase over last year.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short term investments were $642 million. This compares to last year\u2019s balance of $648 million. Cash from operating activities was $71 million, capital expenditures were $30 million, and free cash flow was $41 million. As a reminder, free cash flow is lower in the first quarter due to the payout of annual employee bonuses.", "Return on invested capital increased 0.5% to 8.6%. We are making good progress towards our goal of a 10% return on invested capital in the next couple of years.", "Paying down debt continues to be our top priority. To that end, we use the proceeds from the sale of the mass spec joint venture and the bond offering, as well as cash on hand to pay off term loans amounting to $1.97 billion. As a result, our ending debt as of March 31st was $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.15 billion and senior notes of $1.5 billion.", "Our leverage ratio is approximately 2.7 times, and we still expect to be between 2.0 and 2.5 times by the end of the year. Since the merger of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems, we\u2019ve paid off $900 million in debt.", "I\u2019ll now move on to our expectations for the rest of the year. Our full year guidance is unchanged. Revenue growth is expected to be in the mid-to-high single digits and EPS is expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. As we stated in our Q4 call, the impact from the NIH stimulus is the main driver between the mid- and the high-single digit revenue growth.", "As Greg mentioned earlier, the impact from the stimulus was approximately the same as we saw in the fourth quarter of last year, $10 million. At this point, we expect that the impact of stimulus funding will be spread over a longer period of time with more of the spending now pushed into 2011. We\u2019ll keep you updated on the impact of the stimulus funding as we move through the year.", "As is our practice, I will also give you a few specific items to take into consideration for the coming quarter. First, in regard to the stimulus, as we stated on the Q4 call, we intend to reinvest approximately half of the operating profit from the stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These reinvestments will begin in the second quarter and will be primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets such as China and India.", "Gross margins are expected to decrease sequentially as price is normally strongest in the first quarter. Additionally, in the second quarter we expect to sell a higher mix of instruments, which are lower margin than our consumables.", "Operating expenses are expected to increase sequentially due to increases in investment in emerging markets and R&D as well as the full quarter impact of new hires and merit increases that went into effect at the beginning of April. Our currency guidance is unchanged. We continue to expect the impact on revenue will be one to two points of additional growth for the year, including the impact of our hedging programs.", "And lastly, we\u2019ve received questions on the impact to our business of the eruption of the volcano in Iceland, and we are pleased to report there has been no material impact on revenue. Delivery times did increase slightly due to a switch to \u2013 a switch from air to ground freight. However, we were able to supply our customers from stock at our European distribution centers.", "And with that, I will now hand the call over to Eileen for Q&A.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, David. Because of time constraints, I\u2019d like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one followup question. If you have additional questions after that and you would like to ask please get back in the queue and we can take any remaining questions on the post call scheduled for later this afternoon.", "Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert Baird", "Hi, good afternoon. Nice start to the year, guys.", "Greg Lucier", "Thank you.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert Baird", "First question, Greg. With respect to the NIH stimulus and it\u2019s getting \u2013 it looks like it\u2019s going to be spread out a little bit further, could you tell us a little bit about what are your customers doing, is it just being more cautious? And then with respect to your reaffirmed guidance, is it that other markets or new products will help make up for that little push-out?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, Quintin, I think the first quarter shows that even with a lower stimulus spending than perhaps we all envisioned we still grew organically at 10%. And so I think it shows that the teams are executing and that we may be perhaps gaining share, and so as we look at now stimulus being spread out over more quarters than we originally thought, I think what we are counting on and we\u2019ve demonstrated it that we can execute, we can grow, and still achieve the financial estimates that we\u2019ve given you and others for the 2010 year.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert Baird", "And then just a quick followup, what percent of your sales are being generated by new products over like the last two years?", "Greg Lucier", "Eileen may be I will turn that to you in terms of that particular fact.", "Eileen Pattinson", "We actually haven\u2019t given out that level of details in terms of new \u2013 revenue generated by new products, but we\u2019ll get into more detail, Quintin, at the analyst day in June.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert Baird", "Super, thank you, guys.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hey thanks for taking the question. David, in your comments a minute ago, you just talked about some of the commercial investments in China and India. Can you elaborate a little bit on what that entails?", "David Hoffmeister", "Why don\u2019t I hand that over to Bernd.", "Bernd Brust", "Hi, Tycho, how are you. In China and India, I mean the focus really continues to be for us to get closer and closer to our customers, that really that means a couple of things. We continue to invest in our IT infrastructure, making sure our websites are in local language and has accessibility to local markets that way as well as continuing to invest in direct sales forces for both those countries.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And then with regards to the flow cytometry business, you\u2019ve talked about that being a pretty large market; I think $1.7 billion or so. Can you talk a little bit about how the early reception to Attune has been and how you are approaching the go-to-market strategy?", "Greg Lucier", "Mark, you want to grab that one?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, I can add to that. So, yes, we see it\u2019s a big opportunity, actually $1.4 billion was the number we put out for the size of the market. We\u2019ve just started shipping our first early access units to customers here in the U.S. and shipped our first units into Europe. The reaction has been very positive, particularly around the ability to detect rare events, so the ability to slow the flow down and to do something that other systems can't do in traditional flow has been well received by the market.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, and then, Mark, just one last one on the enhancements to SOLiD that you highlighted at EasyBead. Can you talk a little bit about how EasyBead has done and what the customer reception has been to SOLiD 4?", "Mark Stevenson", "The customer reception on EasyBead has been very positive. I mean really that was one of the major bottlenecks they were finding. And so just being able to automate that front end is a big relief for many of those customers who wanted to get into the accuracy, but needed that automation up front.", "And then on SOLiD 4, really the combination of the new pricing and the roll out of the new software and system in there has been well received. We\u2019ve been very active in this quarter in rolling that out and a good update on the SOLiD 4; we had our best quarter ever as you saw in our results.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed, sir.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Lucier", "Hi.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "So, first question, I believe you said that there were some signs the biopharma end market is starting to improve. Could you just provide a little bit more color in terms of exactly what you are seeing and would you be willing to tell us what biopharma sales growth is incorporated into your guidance?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, in the latter part, I don\u2019t think we are willing to disclose that level of detail, but on the first part of your comment, as we look at the first quarter of 2009 and then compare it to the first quarter of 2010 there clearly has been a recovery in research spending across the biopharma customer base for us. Now, it\u2019s still not having returned to 2008 levels, but it\u2019s coming back quarter-by-quarter nicely and that type of incremental return is what we have thought about and included in our 2010 estimate.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "And any chance you would be willing to speak to whether you are seeing demand across all areas of pharma spending, meaning is it more an early-stage or it\u2019s late-stage, do you have that level of detail available?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, screening campaigns as an example greatly dropped off when the economic crisis hit. We are starting to see screening campaigns return again. And we are also seeing more spending back into the basic research areas as well. And so I\u2019d say there is just overall a better tone and tenor to the research spending in that customer base.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "And one more question, Greg, I think you were over at the GET conference today at Boston or was that I think you were scheduled to be there. You know there is a decent focus I mean the focus of that meeting was on personalized genomes. One of your challenges in second generation sequencing has been the fact that you were second to the market. Do you expect this challenge that you\u2019ve had over the last couple of years with SOLiD to be different in this area of sequencing, I mean do you think you are better positioned at personalized medicine?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think as Mark referenced, we believe SOLiD has a distinct accuracy advantage versus other platforms, and customers that are discriminating are starting to understand that and we think that really allows SOLiD to be a preferred platform for medical applications. And that\u2019s where all our efforts really ever more are focused is this move more towards the clinical application of sequencing. So, that is, as Mark said, why we had one of our best quarters ever in SOLiD and why we feel that while we may have been second, we might just be first in terms of the medical application of sequencing.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay, that\u2019s great. And actually, if can slip one more, and, Mark \u2013", "Eileen Pattinson", "Doug, you need to get back in the queue.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "You got to catch on, okay. Alright, I will get back in the queue. Sorry about that and thanks for taking my question.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed, sir.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes, hey guys, good afternoon. So, first question, if we just cut the business as consumables growth versus instruments in the quarter, can you tell us kind of what the relative organic growth rates were?", "Eileen Pattinson", "So, Greg, I can take that. We actually grew low-double digits in both areas of the business.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then just I mean I realize that you may be pushing out some of the stimulus into next year, but maybe talking about \u2013 so are expecting kind of this $10 million level to continue over the next few quarters? Do we still see some incremental growth off of that and kind of is that making you comfortable still with organic growth guidance for the year.", "Greg Lucier", "Well, we feel comfortable about the organic growth guidance for the year. We\u2019ve reaffirmed that. But in terms of particular amount of stimulus in the ensuing quarters, I will defer it to you, Eileen, in terms of disclosure.", "David Hoffmeister", "Well, I think (inaudible) Greg, this is David, if I can add, in our guidance, in our revenue guidance we\u2019ve said a growth for the year of mid-to-high single digits. And that basically covers that range of stimulus. So if we get more stimulus we\u2019ll move towards that high-single digit growth. Lower level of stimulus that we have we\u2019ll be closer to mid-single digits. And I think no one knows. You know we are watching it very closely. Bernd has a dedicated team that\u2019s following it, but it\u2019s really beyond our control. We\u2019ll just see how it flows out.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great, thanks.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie Capital. Please proceed, sir.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Hi, thanks a million for taking the question. Just two questions. The first is you mentioned on the Genetic Systems and CE that you continue to see some growth and I am curious one of the labs that reported last week was saying that even though people are very interested, states are very interested in forensics and human identification, that given the budget situation that many of these are there, just not able to do what perhaps they would like to do. And I am just curious if you are seeing any of that impact or expect to see some of that impact as you go throughout the year?", "Greg Lucier", "Mark, you want to handle that one?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, I mean so far our demand for the forensic sample analysis far outstretches both capabilities of lab and to some extend funding. So to the extent there is more funding available, I mean this year we were fortunate The Debbie Smith Act here in the U.S. was reauthorized fully at $151 million and that gets trickled down to the states. Clearly, the states are under some pressure, but mostly we see the political pressure and will always still to fund the increased DNA testing both here in the U.S. and as we\u2019ve seen internationally with Japan coming on board and strong growth in other countries around the world. It still is a double-digit growing market for us.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Okay. And then, Greg, one of the aspects of the story that was very interesting about in vitro and maybe it\u2019s gotten lost a little bit is your e-commerce channel. And just I noticed that you are doing pretty good 18% in the quarter. Maybe you can just talk about any initiatives you have there kind of where that\u2019s falling and the relative importance of where you look to invest looking forward?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, we have a goal internally to try to surpass the $1 billion of e-commerce across both the Invitrogen site and the AB.com site, which you know a billion dollars of e-commerce I think in any industry there is probably only a handful that are doing that level of sales. When we combined the two companies, we combined the two e-commerce teams and actually added to them and so we\u2019ve got a very large team and infrastructure now. And as Bernd said, the real work is to add what maybe as some sophisticated features in other industries into this one, and more importantly in some way is to localize the sites into China, into Japan, into other languages to really drive that revenue growth and it\u2019s been very successful for us and so we continue it.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital", "Thanks a million.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Operator?", "Operator", "Our following question comes from the line of Steven Lichtman with JMP Securities. Please proceed.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "Thank you. Good afternoon. First question I had was, did this quarter include any placements of SOLiD to Ignite and if not when is that expected to start this year?", "Greg Lucier", "Bernd, I will turn that to you.", "Bernd Brust", "Hi, Steven. No SOLiD units were placed with Ignite yet. As you know, Ignite is still finalizing its business plans. We are all set to continue to partner with them as they finalize how they will get to commercialize soon here. So, at this point, now SOLiD units have been place.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay. And then just the follow-up on foreign currency, may be just a little bit more details on the hedging program, just given the strengthening of the dollar, we are still keeping it in that 1% to 2% range. How are you keeping it still in that positive 1% to 2% impact of the top line and do you expect the bottom line impact to be the same as you thought a couple of months back? Thanks.", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, at this point we don\u2019t see any significant change in our projection.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "(inaudible)", "Greg Lucier", "No, again either the top line or the bottom line should still be covered by our guidance.", "Steven Lichtman \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay, great. Alright, thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS Capital. Please proceed.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS Capital", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Lucier", "Good afternoon.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS Capital", "Hey, I jumped on the call late, so my apologies if you have asked this, but I am curious just on the Cell Systems strength, I am curious just like have you seen a real boost from the stem cell initiatives for that funding was from \u2013 coming from California. They had to build (inaudible) has any real meaningful funds come from that or have you seen \u2013 as that tied up the budget? And I also kind of want to take that on just a followup on the Cell Systems, so it\u2019s like what are you seeing in terms of bioproduction, picked up yet? Have some of the recent contamination issues at some of the big companies, have that had an impact on your customers getting more concerned about quality control?", "Greg Lucier", "Well \u2013 I mean this is Greg. Overall, Cell Systems had a very good quarter and as you referenced bioproduction had in particular a good quarter. And the contamination issues you referenced didn\u2019t impact us, but as you say I think further stimulates another part of our business, which is \u2013 use of PCR technology and quality control. So, we see a very robust future of applying that technology to bioproduction.", "On the stem cell side, as you know we started that business several years ago and brought in some real strong leadership and that\u2019s a business now that continues to grow at very strong double digits spurred on by NIH work, California, overseas, and just the general move towards primary cell usage. So, it\u2019s been a great business for us and continues to do so.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS Capital", "And just one quick followup question. I just jumped on late, but the R&D spend was a little bit below where I thought it was going to be tracking for this quarter. Are you still expecting that to ramp up specifically towards the back half as you move forward the year?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, as we said in our guidance, in the second quarter, we do plan incremental investments in R&D and so you will see the R&D line tick up going forward here.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS Capital", "Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from the Jon Wood with Jefferies. Please proceed, sir.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Jefferies", "Hey, thanks a lot. So, it looks like you will be with \u2013 I mean I had you below your \u2013 within your target leverage ratios, but I think I heard David say 2.7. It looks like you will be well within that in the second quarter. Is it reasonable to assume there are some share repurchases that could begin here in the second quarter?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think our use of capital hasn\u2019t changed. So, number one use is pay down the debt and you are right, Jon, we want to get between 2.0 to 2.5 times and that we have said we\u2019ll certainly be there by the end of the year. I don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll be there in the second quarter. We also, in terms of paying down the debt, we have a convert that\u2019s callable in August. That\u2019s $350 million. And at the current level of stock we would call that at that point in time.", "Once we are within our range, and we have been, second use of our cash is to look at acquisitions, primarily tuck-in and key technologies. And then our philosophy still is to return excess cash to shareholders. So, at that point we would look at share buybacks, but that will probably be end of the year or 2011.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And are you willing to disclose anything, I mean I know you announced a tuck-in today, and then I saw on the tape about a month ago a German Company, (inaudible) disclose what in terms of invested capital to assume from these deals in the second quarter.", "Eileen Pattinson", "So, Jon, we haven\u2019t released any information around those two acquisitions in terms of more than what you\u2019ve already got.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay. And the only way you can pay down debt at this point right is the convert, right, because I think you are fixed on the senior notes side at this point. Is that correct, David?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, that\u2019s correct. We have the $1.2 billion roughly of converts outstanding that are \u2013 have put call dates over the next three years.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Jefferies", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Jeff Ares with Leerink Swann. Please proceed, sir.", "Jeff Ares \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. Going off of the earlier question about SOLiD and TGen, I remember when that was announced at the time you said there were more potential deals like that in the pipeline. I am wondering if you can provide us with an update on that.", "Greg Lucier", "Mark and Bernd?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, you will see in the coming pipeline more focus as Greg mentioned where we see these interests in the translational medicine group and TGen is a great example of actually taking what we are discovering about cancer and applying that. And an example again, you saw this last quarter and was in our numbers was the group in BC Kansa [ph] which is really taking a discovery to translational medicine approach. There will be more of those during the coming year and you will see that is announced as we do those deals.", "Jeff Ares \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay, great, thanks. And as a followup, could you provide us a little bit of an update on how project Starlight is going and if you guys still target again early access customers by the end of the year?", "Mark Stevenson", "So, we got very good reception from the technical data that we showed at the scientific meeting, the AGBT, just tremendous interest in some of the features of the system particularly in its ability to do recursive sequencing to go back over and improve both the accuracy and the read length. We are beginning now to talk with the early access customers that saw some of these presentations and would expect to more fully engage with them at the end of this calendar year.", "Jeff Ares \u2013 Leerink Swann", "All right. And one \u2013 I mean you talked at the time at AGBT that you would be seeing some other data later this year. Any idea of timing for that like may be (inaudible) spring or\u2013?", "Greg Lucier", "We will release some of that data as we go through. We haven\u2019t targeted since it\u2019s not a commercial product particularly in meetings but there will be clear experiments we\u2019ll do and continue to share that with the community.", "Jeff Ares \u2013 Leerink Swann", "All right. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with First Analysis. Please proceed, sir.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 First Analysis", "Hi, thank you. My first question is on the revenue guidance. Besides what you mentioned in Japan as well as tougher year-over-year comps, is there anything else that we should think about mitigating your revenue growth for the balance of the year?", "Greg Lucier", "David?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, I think that you know the two things that we mentioned were Japan, which had just a phenomenal first quarter. As Greg pointed out, that team has done a great job. But we don\u2019t expect growth to continue at that rate in the subsequent quarters. And then the other wild card is what we\u2019ve talked about as well is the stimulus.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay, thank you. And my followup, either Greg or David, could you walk me through the thought process in closing Camarillo and what steps you\u2019ve taken to mitigate any disruption from that closure?", "Greg Lucier", "You bet. Frederick, Maryland has become ever more of the R&D center for our Cell Systems business. And we have a lot of very talented R&D people there. And so we wanted to centralize the antibody piece of that overall portfolio into Frederick. I would also say that by making it closer to our large distribution center there in Frederick, we can have much more rapid delivery times for the myriad of antibodies that we do provide.", "Now, in terms of not having disruption, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at these transfers as we\u2019ve brought together AB and Invitrogen and so the same team that transferred production out of Foster City in 2009 is on the job here in Camarillo and we\u2019ve built up substantial inventories in Frederick ahead of time before we have phased out production in Camarillo.", "Dan Leonard \u2013 First Analysis", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Greg, I wonder if you could just talk to what\u2019s happened with the NIH, meaning what\u2019s the drug in force behind that delay.", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think that\u2019s more a speculation than anything if were to give you answers. I think people are generally being cautious. I think they are trying to use other monies first. And I think that\u2019s just how we are seeing this play out right now. Now, there is a deadline to this program. It has to all be spent by 2011 and so it will get spent. It\u2019s just a question of at what pace.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you. And then just as a followup on the clinical market, you talked about that. What\u2019s your strategy there for diagnostics and can you talk in any kind of revenue number over the next couple of years for that market?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, we already do in excess of $300 million a year in molecular diagnostics. We, as I have said to others, have a very strong franchise and the fundamental tools and technologies that go into other people\u2019s diagnostics test. Secondly, we continue to get our platforms, our interim [ph] platforms validated and certified. And as I had mentioned, with the new ViiA 7, that\u2019s certainly our goal with this new PCR platform. So, we will have ever more instruments for molecular diagnostics.", "And then selectively we are making smaller acquisitions like we did with AcroMetrix around molecular diagnostic controls. So we like our strategy. We think it\u2019s kind of a smart incremental way to build out from our core strength. And it\u2019s giving us nice growth.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our following question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good evening. So, as we think about kind of the portfolio as you have evolved it, we\u2019ve obviously had a great amount of new product introductions and you\u2019ve set this sort of goal to grow above the market. I mean as we look out on kind of the longer term basis, as you look at sort of the biopharma and academic markets, I mean is your view on sort of the growth trajectory there changed at all, whether it\u2019s based on global mix or sort of what\u2019s gone on from recovery perspective broadly from \u2013 in terms of the economy?", "Greg Lucier", "You know, Ross, our view hasn\u2019t changed. We actually have remained confident that 2010, \u201911, and really as much as anybody can have a portal into the future of 2012 look pretty good for us. And so we think the next couple of years just due to our disciplined execution, our international footprint, and all of these new products continuing to come out of the R&D labs, we feel we can continue to grow above the market, as we have demonstrated.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks a million, Greg.", "Greg Lucier", "Yes.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you. This concludes our first quarter earnings conference call. This webcast will be available via a replay on our website for three weeks. As a reminder, we will be hosting a followup Q&A call for investors and analyst at 7\u2019O Clock PM Eastern Time.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer", "Thank you. Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today we have Marijn Dekkers, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Casper, Senior Vice President; and Pete Wilver, our Chief Financial Officer.

So with that, I\u2019d like to now turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Thanks Ken, good morning everyone. We\u2019re glad you could join us this morning because we have a lot of good news to share with you today. It was another strong quarter. We again delivered excellent financial results and we\u2019re also making tremendous progress on our pending merger with Fisher Scientific, which we believe will make us an even stronger company going forward. Before I comment on the status of the merger let me first review some of the highlights of the quarter with you.", "As you can read in our press release our growth momentum continued in the third quarter with strong performance across our businesses. We had a 7% increase in revenues and most of that was organic growth. Adjusted EPS growth was 16% and adjusted operating income growth was 15%. I\u2019m also pleased to report that we had great expansion of our adjusted operating margin again this quarter, up 110 basis points. We\u2019ve been able to consistently improve our operating margins mainly because we are selling more new products which tend to have higher margins.", "Two new products in particular that are doing exceptionally well are our breakthrough Orbitrap Mass Spec system which we introduced last year, and the other one is our ICP series of spectroscopy systems for elemental analysis which we launched at PITCOM this year.", "We are clearly the technology leader in our industry and are consistently introducing new products across our businesses. For the year-to-date, our product vitality index, which is the percentage of sales that comes from new product introductions in the last two years, rose to a record 27%.", "Now, in addition to new products, other factors are also contributing to our ongoing margin expansion. There is a focus that we have company wide on productivity through our PPI program, there is a focus we have on getting priced across our product lines, and also our ability to achieve synergies by successfully integrating acquisitions is helping our margins.", "On acquisitions I want to mention that with $1 billion in cash flow after the Fisher merger and a strong balance sheet, we will continue to be active on the acquisition front, especially considering the fact that our industry is still highly fragmented and therefore will likely continue to undergo a fair amount of consolidation. The majority of our divisions will not be involved in the Thermo-Fisher integration, because this primarily affects our lab equipment and diagnostic product lines. So, those other divisions will be ready to take on an acquisition if there is a good opportunity.", "A few comments on the markets \u2013 our growth initiatives obviously are being fueled by our major end-markets that are quite strong, and that has a positive effect on both our business segments. Similar to what we\u2019ve been seeing all year, the global industrial markets remain strong, especially commodity materials production, driving demand for the online analysis instruments we provide in our measurement and control segments. And then sales of our analytical technologies used primarily for research continue to be robust as well in live life and laboratory sciences. Biotech is growing the fastest but our sales to big pharma are also up over last year, and academic markets are showing modest growth.", "So, let me say a few words on our pending merger with Fisher Scientific. As you probably saw in our announcement last week, the SEC has cleared the merger with the agreement that we sell Fisher\u2019s $17 million Genevac business. This means that no further review is needed in the United States. Our last step in completing the merger is to get clearance from the European Commission. The EC has concerns similar to those of the SEC, so last week we responded to their concerns with the exact same offered selling Genevac. Now, the new deadline for the EC to reply to this offer is November 9th and that is the date we now anticipate that the merger will close.", "As we get closer to completion, the excitement surrounding the merger is clearly building, both among our customer and our employees. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen that Fisher reported some excellent third quarter numbers a few days ago. With Thermo and Fisher both doing so well I don\u2019t think there could be a better time for us to join forces. Together we will transform the life laboratory and health sciences industry so that our customers can more effectively do their important work that leads to a healthier, cleaner, and safer world.", "On guidance, before I turn the call over to our CFO Peter Wilbur, let me review our guidance for the rest of the year with you. Based on our excellent performance, we are increasing our 2006 adjusted EPS guidance now to a range of $1.74 to $1.77 from our previous estimate of $1.68 to $1.73. This accounts for $0.10 per share of stock option expense. The revised guidance would put us 18% to 20% ahead of last year\u2019s results on a pro-forma basis including stock option expense. We also now expect higher revenues of $2.88 billion to $2.90 billion in 2006 versus the $2.81 billion to $2.86 billion we originally estimated. That would lead to growth of 9% to 10% revenues over 2005.", "Now, on top of that, assuming we complete the merger with Fisher on November 9th, we expect $0.01 to $0.03 of accretion to our adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter, and we plan to update our 2007 guidance for the new combined company in mid-December as we\u2019ve done in the past.", "So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pete for his financial review. Pete.", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Marijn, good morning everyone. Just as a reminder we began reporting our financials including FAS 123R stock option expense beginning in the first quarter of this year. For purposes of comparison, the prior year consolidated numbers that I will be discussing today have been adjusted on a pro-forma basis to include stock option expense where applicable.", "In the third quarter, stock option expense was $6.7 million or 0.9% of revenue and approximately $0.03 of earnings per share. This amount was $1.5 million higher than the prior year on a pro-forma basis, which unfavorably impacted our adjusted operating margin by 20 basis points and our adjusted EPS by approximately 7/10s of a cent.", "For the full year, our current guidance for Thermo on a standalone basis includes approximately $0.10 per share of stock option expense versus $0.08 per share in 2005 on a pro-forma basis. As Marijn said, our adjusted EPS for the quarter grew 16% to $0.44 as compared to $0.38 last year. GAAP earnings per share in the third quarter was $0.30, which is lower than adjusted earnings per share primarily as a result of acquisition intangibles amortization, and down from last year\u2019s $0.35 principally due to a gain in the prior year related to the sale of our point of care business and stock option expense, partially offset by our significantly improved operating performance. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS.", "Revenues in the quarter increased 7% or $46 million year-over-year to $725 million. Organic revenues in the quarter were up 6% excluding favorable currency translation of 2% and the net effect of acquisitions and divestitures. Bookings again exceeded revenues in this quarter by about 3%.", "In life and laboratory sciences, revenues rose 5% both on a reported basis and organically. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in both our life sciences and industrial markets. Our new product introductions specifically in mass spectrometry and elemental analysis product lines also continued to be a key growth driver. In measurement control, revenues rose 11% on a reported basis and 7% organically. We saw a strong demand in our commodity materials and industrial markets driven by our online process instrumentation.", "By regions, Europe and Asia-Pacific both grew in the high single digits and China grew at over 15%. North America was up slightly and the rest of the world rebounded from last year to grow at over 30%.", "Adjusted operating income increased 15% or $14 million year-over-year to $108.7 million. Adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 110 basis points from 13.9% in the year ago quarter. As I mentioned previously, stock option expense was $6.7 million in the third quarter, which was $1.5 million or 20 basis points higher than the prior year. Stock option expense is not allocated to this segment for adjusted reporting purposes.", "Life and laboratory sciences adjusted operating income increased by 13% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 18.3%, up 120 basis points versus 17.1% last year. The increase in margin rate was primarily attributable to pull through on incremental organic revenues, price increases net of inflation, and the benefit of our sourcing and productivity initiatives.", "In measurement control, adjusted operating income increased by 28% and adjusted operating margin increased by 190 basis points to 14.2% versus 12.3% in the prior year. The increase in margin rate was primarily attributable to productivity improvements, price increases net of inflation, and pull through on incremental organic revenues.", "Adjusted gross margin was 46.7%, up 150 basis points from 45.2% in the year ago quarter, primarily driven by price increases net of inflation and the benefit of our sourcing and productivity initiatives.", "SG&A was 26.4% of revenue in the third quarter, up 90 basis points from the year ago quarter. The increase was primarily driven by a nonrecurring pension adjustment as well as a slight shift in our revenue to businesses with a higher percentage of direct sales. We expect SG&A as a percentage of revenue to return to recent historical levels in the fourth quarter.", "R&D was 5.3% of revenue in the third quarter, down 50 basis points from the year ago quarter; however, we\u2019re continuing to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our R&D spend as evidenced by our growth from new products and our strong product vitality index that Marijn commented on.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 30.6%, which is in line with our previously communicated full year forecast rate of 31%. This year\u2019s rate is 2% lower than last year\u2019s third quarter adjusted rate of 32.6%, primarily as a result of the year-to-date adjustment in the prior year related to the estimated impact of a change in U.K. tax law. The lower tax rate resulted in about $0.01 year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share. Net interest expense was essentially flat over the prior year and other income decreased $2.7 million or about $0.01 per share due to lower securities gains.", "Average diluted shares were down 2.1% to 162.2 million shares reflecting the full benefit of the shares we bought back late in the second quarter. The lower share count contributed about $0.01 to adjusted EPS versus the prior year.", "In terms of the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with $173 million in cash and investments, down $25 million from the second quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by paying down our short-term borrowings and partially offset by strong operating cash flow. Our debt was down $100 million versus the second quarter to $539 million, primarily as a result of paying down our short-term borrowings as I just mentioned.", "Receivables DSO came in at 67 days, a 1-day improvement versus both the prior year and prior quarter, and inventory days of supply were also down 1 day as compared to the prior year to 95 days. We expect these favorable trends to continue and are driving to improve our working capital metrics by at least 5% during 2006.", "Cash flow from continuing operations in the third quarter were strong at $101.1 million. After deducting net capital expenditures of $8 million, operating cash flow from continuing operations was $93 million. This amount is $47 million higher than the prior year, primarily as a result of improved working capital performance and higher adjusted net income.", "So, let me just review with you the guidance that we have on our press release. Based on our excellent operating performance, we are increasing our full year 2006 adjusted EPS guidance to a range of $1.74 to $1.77 from our previous guidance of $1.68 to $1.73 including $0.10 of stock option expense. This range represents an 18% to 20% increase over our pro-forma 2005 adjusted earnings of $1.47. We\u2019re also increasing our full year reported revenue guidance to a range of $2.88 billion to $2.9 billion, which is 9% to 10% increase above 2005, reflecting our year-to-date growth performance. This guidance does not include any benefit from the Fisher merger. Assuming we complete the merger on November 9th, we expect accretion to our adjusted EPS of $0.01 to $0.03 in the fourth quarter. This would translate to $0.06 to $0.08 accretion for the full year due to the favorable effect of our full year weighted average shares on the incremental earnings from Fisher in the fourth quarter.", "In summary, this was another excellent quarter for us operationally. We again exhibited our ability to expand adjusted operating margins and we\u2019re on track to achieve our 2006 margin expansion goal of well above 100 basis points. We also grew our revenues driven by strong new product introductions and healthy end-markets. Overall, these results position us well for a strong finish to the year.", "With that I\u2019ll turn it over to questions.", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Operator, we\u2019ll take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "At this time, if you would like to pose a question press * then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Electron management team, I would like to ask that you limit your time on the call to one or two questions. If you have additional questions please return to the queue and pose your questions in turn. We\u2019ll pause for a moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question is coming from Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank", "Good morning gentlemen. I feel like a broken record but congratulations again on another solid quarter. As we look to the end-markets I want to dig in here a little bit deeper and I want to really focus on two, one being pharma and the other being industrial with more of a commodity tinge. Can you talk about, one, some of the management changes at pharma and some of the rhetoric coming out of them would suggest that there is some more belt tightening to occur; however, yourselves as well as some of your peers have talked about potentially an acceleration there or at least a small improvement, could you comment on sort of what you think that those management changes mean and whether the dollars are matching up with the rhetoric? And then on the commodity side, clearly MNC had another very solid quarter, what\u2019s the visibility there and where do you think we are right now in that cycle?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Ross, this is Marijn. On pharma first, we saw good growth in pharma in the third quarter, getting cautiously stronger and in spite that the year-over-year comparison within pharma is getting a little tougher as well. If you remember last year, the first two quarters were very weak in pharma and then started picking up in the third quarter, so to have good growth in pharma over the third quarter last year I think is encouraging. If you ask me to comment on the specific strategies of pharma companies, it\u2019s very hard to do because even \u2014 and I mentioned this in the past \u2014 even companies by reading from the paper don\u2019t seem to be doing that well could still grow significantly with us depending on the specific technology needs they have. So, we\u2019ve seen in the past very good growth with companies that you would think would be tightening their belt. They did tighten their belt overall but not with our specific products. So, it\u2019s very hard to go one by one and make sense necessarily of it, but overall I would say it\u2019s an encouraging trend that the spending is up over the third quarter of last year. On the MNC front, we are talking particularly commodity material here which is the sort of the uncertain part of the demands there, you know and we\u2019ve said this before as well that we are lagging the overall industry there by two or three quarters. So, it\u2019s very hard for us to predict what exactly is going to happen with commodity materials going forward, but we do know that we have visibility out two to three quarters of robust demand.", "Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank", "And quickly on the new products, clearly you guys have been exceptionally good at putting out new instruments specifically in the mass spectrometry market which has helped you gain share there, could you talk about sort of where we are in that cycle? It\u2019s been I feel a significant amount of time since you\u2019ve had an above-market growth there, how much longer do you think you can continue that and are there any changing market dynamics in any of the more specific areas that you introduced new products at this year\u2019s ASMS?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Our mass spec business is doing very, very well. We have obviously a wonderful set of new product technologies introduced in the last zero to two years there. Actually this quarter we came out with the LTQ FT Ultra, which is the highest end mass spectrometer we sell with again much, much improved performance over the original one we introduced three years ago. So, even with these product lines we can continue to optimize and innovate to make an existing model still significantly better. As you know, we\u2019ve done some investments over the last few years in acquisition of the FAIMS technology which is very promising for Triple Quad technology. So I think as long as our customers have a need for improved sensitivity and accuracy, and we know they do have significant needs in that area, we will be able to come out with improved versions or new technologies that help them to do their research better. So, I don\u2019t think this trend is going to stop any time soon, because I believe that customers are still demanding improved capabilities from us.", "Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank", "All right, thanks guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Derik De Bruin of UBS.", "Derik De Bruin, UBS", "Hi, thank you very much. As you near the close of the Fisher acquisition, could you just comment on having seen anything in terms of surprising you either to additional synergies or are you going to save all these comments for the analyst meeting?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "I think I will save a lot of the comments for the analyst meeting obviously, because that\u2019s when we really can talk about the combined company and that\u2019s the time when we will have gone through the operating plans of both companies and know exactly what is lining up for 2007. But I would say overall there have been no surprises in the sense of things we didn\u2019t know about each other before we decided to merge. The cooperation has been excellent. We\u2019ve had a significant number of meetings planning the integration, planning day one, and we\u2019re completely on target in terms of synergies and completely on track to have a day one somewhere in November. So, it has been extremely positive and we\u2019re really pumped about it. The management teams who are going to be responsible for the combined company are in place, the organization has been announced internally, so we\u2019re completely lined up to get this done by November and hit the ground running.", "Derik De Bruin, UBS", "Great. You\u2019ve talked about that you\u2019re still going to have certainly significant operating cash flow, could you just talk about potentially where you see the leverage of the company using some of the cash to pay down debt? Also, you\u2019ve certainly mentioned acquisitions and consolidating, do you think that businesses such as chromatography are still potentially of interest as well?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In terms of usages of cash I think we\u2019re pretty consistent with the way we\u2019ve looked at it in the past. Certainly number one would be acquisitions, number two is share buybacks, and at this point we wouldn\u2019t be in a situation where we would want to be buying down our debt. We\u2019re pretty comfortable with the leverage of where we are today, so I would say acquisitions and then share buybacks are the number one and number two. I\u2019ll let Marijn comment on chromatography or other acquisition candidates.", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Yeah, obviously now in the combination with Fisher we\u2019re going to have a broader interest, if I can call it that way, in terms of the type of acquisitions we would be interested in doing. Fisher has traditionally been very focused on consumables and services, we\u2019ve been focused on more hardware and software acquisitions, and now the combined company will have an opportunity to do a mix of both of these types of acquisitions. So, the prioritization will be a little bit more difficult I think than when we were standalones, but you know it\u2019s a very fragmented industry still and there are opportunities. I think it gets harder to be a smaller company as consolidation is happening. So, I think some smaller companies will look at how the industry is changing and say \u201cDo I really want to go this alone or am I better off partnering up with one of the larger companies?\u201d So, I believe there will be a lot of opportunity for us to do acquisitions and we\u2019ll be as careful as we\u2019ve always been in evaluating them and picking the right one.", "Derik De Bruin, UBS", "Great, thanks a lot guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Jason Weiss of Robert W. Baird.", "Jason Weiss, Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning. I know you said you\u2019re going to put a lot off until the analyst day, but I\u2019m curious about the combined tax rate, how you anticipate that happening, there\u2019s a pretty big gap between the effective tax rate Fisher shows and you show, and could you give us a little guidance on how to think about that?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in terms of the 2006 accretion that we talked about, that\u2019s simply a weighted average of what Fisher has forecast for the fourth quarter portion that we would own them and then our forecast for the fourth quarter. Going into 2007, I really don\u2019t want to comment on what the tax rate might be. As Marijn said, we haven\u2019t gone through the detailed operating plans of the two companies. The tax rate is a very complexed calculation and requires a lot of diligence to come up with that number, so at this point I don\u2019t want to comment on it.", "Jason Weiss, Robert W. Baird", "Okay, thank you very much, I\u2019ll get back in the queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan", "Good morning, thanks for taking the call. On the instrument front, you guys expanded your portfolio in the HPLC business with Accela this year, can you just comment a little bit on how that\u2019s doing and how much pull through you\u2019re seeing with some of the mass spec shipments?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "We introduced Accela in May at ASMS, so Accela is now commercially available, is being evaluated by our customers. The feedback is excellent and in many cases we are compared directly to our competitors who have high pressure and fast HPLCs and we do very well in those comparisons. Now, it\u2019s too early to say that we got all these orders because we\u2019re obviously commercializing it, but if asked that question again I would say next quarter or the quarter afterwards, because we will then have more to talk about in terms of specific results, but the first response is very positive.", "Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan", "Okay great, one thing that Waters had highlighted yesterday in their results was some of the growth they\u2019re seeing on the CRO and generic manufacturing front, can you comment on how you view that opportunity, are those opportunities?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Those are huge opportunities, both of them, they\u2019re very different obviously, the CROs because big pharma have a trend to outsource more so CROs then get that work and they need to build laboratories, which is good for us. And generic pharma is obviously competing with big pharma and is also realizing more and more that they want to do their own research. It\u2019s actually very interesting to see that generic pharma is in some cases changing its model from just copying drugs to also beginning to try to invent and develop drugs, which is something that they haven\u2019t traditionally done. They\u2019re putting an infrastructure in place to support that, which means new laboratories, but it will be interesting to watch how good they are really going to be at doing that, because it\u2019s a very different skill obviously than copying a drug after the patents expire. But to us it\u2019s all good news; I mean the more people are doing research in this area and the more people are building laboratories or expanding their laboratory footprints the better it is for us.", "Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan", "Okay great. Then finally on the low-cost sourcing initiatives, you had I think talked about $14 million in components from lower cost countries and about $4 million in savings for this year, is that still accurate and could you give us a little bit of a broad brush stroke as to how you view the opportunity for Fisher?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "You have a good memory Tycho. That\u2019s right, we have a sourcing organization of over 40 people in Shanghai and what they\u2019re doing is they\u2019re obviously sourcing for those instruments that we are now producing in Shanghai rather than in the western factories. So that\u2019s our first task to do local sourcing for the local production, but while they\u2019re at it they\u2019re also sourcing parts for instruments that we make in the western part of the world. So, the combination of that is leading to significant savings and the rough number is that we can save if once we\u2019ve qualified a part, whether it\u2019s a printed circuit board or some other part that goes into an instrument, we save about 35% from sourcing it in China versus the western countries, so it\u2019s very significant. And this will only get higher and the number will only increase as we are going forward, because this is just really the beginning, we\u2019re scratching the surface. From a Fisher point of view, there is also a benefit there. It\u2019s easier though to do sourcing for parts that are used in hardware than for materials that are used in consumables. So, you don\u2019t easily go and buy a truck load of resin in China and then mold it in New Hampshire, if you know what I mean. You can do that easier with a consolidative part. But, the opportunity is there and we\u2019ll certainly benefit from that capability in the new company.", "Tycho Peterson, JP Morgan", "Okay, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder if you would like to pose a question press * and then the number 1 on your telephone keypad. Your next question is coming from Paul Knight of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Paul Knight, Thomas Weisel Partners", "Hi Marijn.", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Hi Paul.", "Paul Knight, Thomas Weisel Partners", "Could you talk about your thought on the measurement and control backlog? I know we always think that it\u2019s got a nine-month window at the very least, where are you with that? And then on a product specific item, NITON Analyzer, I think that\u2019s been a great product for you, how is it now today?", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "On the visibility, it goes back to how much visibility we have in commodity materials. We went through this cycle in 2000-2001 with measurement and control when the economy was very strong, and we back then had a two to three quarter sort of runway left when the economy clearly started deteriorating and commodity material prices were falling. So, I\u2019ve said before, if it would also apply today I still think we have two or three quarters on it, but I don\u2019t really see it all fall apart today, because the global demand picture in commodity materials with China and India being so strong now, it\u2019s really quite different than it was in the last cycle six years ago. So, we\u2019ll see what happens but for the next two or three quarters we\u2019re okay for sure in this area. Your second question on the NITON Analyzers and that has been a great success story for us. We acquired NITON in the spring of last year. They\u2019ve grown tremendously. They have wonderful products and are right in the sweet spot of our customers who want to analyze complex metals outside of the laboratories. So, there has been some regulation changes in the European Commission with respect to how to deal with scrap metal and that has helped us, and overall the technology is so good now of these NITON Analyzers that people just do the testing in the fields and don\u2019t even bother to bring these samples back to the lab, and it has really been terrific from a growth point of view.", "Paul Knight, Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question is coming from John Sullivan of Leerink Swann.", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann", "Hey guys good morning. Pete, can you just go over again the growth in the quarter geographically?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. North America was up slightly, both Europe and Asia-Pac were in the high single digits, and then the rest of the world which is obviously a very small number for us in an absolute sense was up over 30%.", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann", "Okay, in that high single digit for Asia-Pac, did you China up 15%?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "China was up 15%, yes.", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann", "Did you comment on India?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I didn\u2019t comment on India, but it was up about the same as China, 15% to 16%.", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann", "Okay, and then any specific comment on Japan?", "Peter M. Wilver, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Japan was actually up pretty strong; they were a driver in that number for Asia-Pac.", "John Sullivan, Leerink Swann", "Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any closing remarks.", "Marijn E. Dekkers, President and CEO", "Well, just let me say in closing that the third quarter was obviously another strong quarter for Thermo with good growth across the company. Fisher also had a strong quarter reporting record sales and earnings, and therefore we believe this is an ideal time for both companies to join together and it will mark the beginning of a new and exciting chapter in our history. Thank you for your continued support, thanks for being on the call today.", "Operator", "Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s Thermo Electron conference call.

", "We have now delivered three strong quarters as Thermo Fisher Scientific. And our results clearly show that we are successfully operating as a unified company. ", "Our primary end markets continue to be strong. We have a number of new products across our businesses that are in great demand and we have a culture of operating discipline that\u2019s focused on continuously improving our business processes in order to best serve our customers. ", "All of these growth drivers are coming together to fuel our strong performance. The integration of Thermo and Fisher has gone exceedingly well; better than I could have imagined when we closed to merger, nine months ago. ", "I said at last quarter and I will say it again, I really, I\u2019m extremely pleased with the way our employees embraced this merger and immediately started working together towards our goals as one company. ", "And it\u2019s great to see that the collaboration is creating value for our shareholders, our customers, and of course also our employees. So let me quickly summarize the financial results. Q2 again, I\u2019m only going to compare our revenues and adjusted operating results except for EPS with pro-forma 2006 as if Thermo and Fisher were combined for all of 2006. ", "And pro-forma our revenues grew 9% to a record $2.39 billion. Our adjusted EPS was also a record increasing 55% to $0.65. Adjusted operating income rose 25% and we also had another great quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion, up 220 basis points to 17%. We also continue to be on-track to deliver the $75 million of merger synergies this year, most of which are cost synergy. ", "So, all in all another very strong quarter resulting in a terrific first half of this year. Little bit of a market update of course, we continue to benefit from the fact that our primary end markets are healthy. And they were really no dramatic changes from what we have seen in the past few quarters. ", "Biotech has remain strong, big pharma continues to get better and both are driving strong sales of our analytical technologies and bioreagents used for life sciences research. Also outsourcing to our BioPharma Services business is growing in the double-digit. Clinical diagnostic markets are showing robust growth resulting in strong sales of our anatomical pathology products used for caner diagnosis and testing. ", "Academic and government markets continue to grow modestly and environmental regulations worldwide continue to drive demand for a range of our products from our portable X-ray instruments to our mercury monitoring system. ", "And lastly industrial markets remain strong creating demand for our process instruments used to optimize the global production of commodity material. On the new product front it was it was also a very productive quarter. Some of you attended ASMS in June, were we showcased a number of new integrated Mass Spectrometry solutions under our Thermo Scientific brand. ", "Customer response since then has been very positive and I'll mentioned a few highlights we introduced two new Orbitrap systems the XL and the discovery giving life science researches new alternatives for protein analysis. From more general applications to those that are highly offend. ", "Our new generations Triple Quad the TSQ Quantum offers more powerful analysis in regulated environmental food, toxicology, drug and clinical research applications. And then also our new SILAC reagent kit optimize our base line of bioreagents for use with our own Mass Spectrometer for more accurate results during protein analysis. In our biosciences business we also opened a new laboratory during the quarter to provide RNAi-based screening services that support drug discovery and development. ", "And this lab features in integrated platform of Thermo Scientific technologies, including our own siRNA and miRNA libraries, high content screening reagents and imaging instrumentation along with robotics and software to automate the workflow. By performing these services for our customers in-house on a contract basis or by transferring the workflow to their own facilities. We expect to accelerate customer\u2019s option of revolutionary biosciences technologies such as RNAi. ", "Another thing I've noted in biosciences is that we, in the quarter launched a 1,000 leader single use bioreactor for cell-culture processing and this expense our product offering in bioprocess containers which saw a record growth in Q2 as BioPharma demand intensifies for safer and more efficient drug development and production tools. ", "Outside the laboratory, our customers are facing a host of new regulations around environmental and consumer safety issues. It is becoming more and more important for them to know exactly which elements are present in products they manufacture for consumers and we have a range of technologies to meet this need. ", "For example, we just launched the series of new Thermo Scientific portable elemental analyzers called the NITON XL3. And we've visited new product line we are meeting our customer's specific needs in alloy analysis compliance with electronic waste and as it in substance regulations, environmental testing, as well as mining and mineral explorations. ", "A quick word on acquisitions, with much of our growth comes from successful products we also continue to keep a close eye on opportunities for strategic acquisition. We are obviously well equipped to make acquisitions that will bring added value for our customers by extending our technology platform and our market reach. ", "For instance this morning we announced our agreement to acquire a company called Qualigens, which is $24 million division of Glaxo Smith Kline based in Mumbai, India. Qualigens is the leading supplier of laboratory chemicals in India. Giving us the leading position in that countries, research laboratory market. ", "Not only those as acquisition extend our commercial reach in India, but it's also very complimentary to our biosciences business and give those greater access to laboratory chemicals and reagents for the global market ", "Given the major push of the global pharmaceutical industry to conduct more research in India. The new acquisition of Qualigens strength our presence there and will help to accelerate our growth in this important market. A word on guidance, also our performance this quarter added up to a strong in first half. And based on this performance, we\u2019re again raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2007. ", "We now expect earnings to be in the range of 250 to 256 versus our estimates earlier of 243 to 253. And this increase would lead to 31 to 34% adjusted EPS growth over our strong results in 2006. We are now also raising our revenue guidance to a range of $9.50 to $9.55 billion over the 9.4 to 9.5 billion we previously announced. And this would result in a 7 to 8% growth in total of the revenues for 2007. So with that, I would like now to turn over the call to our CFO, Peter Wilver, for more details on our financial. Pete? ", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks Marijn. Good morning everyone, as we did last quarter to provide better year-over-year comparisons, the revenue and adjusted operating income numbers, as well as, the working capital metric that I\u2019ll discuss with you today will be presented on a pro forma adjusted basis as if Thermo and Fisher had been combined in all of 2006. ", "Comparisons of below the line items such as interest, taxes, share account, and earnings per share will be discussed on an adjusted basis as reported. As Marijn said, our adjusted earnings per share for the quarter grew 55% or $0.65 compared to $0.42 in Q2 last year. We exceeded Wall Street consensus earnings by $0.05 in the quarter $0.01 of which was a result of our lower tax rate. As I discussed on our Q1 call, the calendarization of our earnings has changed as the result for the merger, and part driven by the increase in consumables as a percent of our total revenue. ", "Regardless, we are pleased with our Q2 results, and have increased our full year earnings guidance to reflect our strong first half performance, and higher confidence in achieving our second half goals. I\u2019ll cover our revised guidance in more detail at the end of the call. GAAP earnings per share in Q2 were $0.37, up from $0.29 in the prior years quarter, primarily as a result of increased earnings from the merger, and improved operating performance, partially offset by higher acquisition intangible and amortization. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS. ", "Operator it appears that someone on the line has their microphone turned on, other than us. ", "Operator", "You have the only live line, sir. ", "Peter Wilver", "Okay. We are getting some background noise. Revenues in Q1 increased 9% year-over-year to 2.39 billion. Organic revenues in the quarter were up 6% excluding non-merger related acquisitions and divestitures, and favorable currency translation of 2%. Bookings slightly exceeded revenues this quarter, by just over 1%. In the Analytical Technologies segment, revenues rose 13% on a reported basis and 8% organically. ", "In the quarter, we saw a strong growth across all our major markets including life sciences, diagnostic and industrial. In addition, to the market strength our new product introductions also continued to be a key growth driver, specifically in our mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and environmental product lines. ", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, revenues for the quarter increased 6% on our reported basis and 4% organically. We saw growth across all of our major market segments with particular strength in BioPharma. By region, we saw organic growth across all our major regions. North America grew organically at slightly below the company average and Europe, and Asia Pacific grew slightly above the company average. The rest of the world grew over 10% from a relatively small base. ", "Moving on to adjusted operating income; Q2 adjusted operating income increased 25% year-over-year to 405 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17%, up 220 basis points from 14.8% in the year ago quarter on a pro forma basis. ", "Stock compensation expense was 12 million in Q2, as compare to 18million in the prior year on a pro forma basis, which contributed 20 basis points to the year-over-year margin expansion in the quarter. The balance of the margin expansion came from all through on our organic incremental revenues and in the impact of our integration, sourcing and productivity initiatives. Analytical Technologies Q2 adjusted operating income it increased by 32% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 19.8%, up 280 basis points versus 17% last year. ", "Laboratory Product and Services, Q2 adjusted operating income, increased by 18%, and adjusted operating margin increased by 140 basis points to 13.9%, as compared to 12.5% in the prior year. ", "For the whole company, adjusting gross margin was 41% in Q2, up 120 basis points from 39.8% in the year ago quarter. Primarily as a result of price increases net of inflation, some favorable mix related acquisitions, volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives. Adjusted SG&A was 21.6% of revenue in Q2, down 80 basis points from 22.4% in the year ago quarter. Primarily as a result of volume leverage integration synergies and lower stock compensation expense. Partially offset by some favorable one-time at history in the previous years quarter. On a year to date basis SG&A, as the percentage of revenue is favorable by a 120 basis points versus last year. ", "We have taken a lot of synergy related cost out of the business in the first half of the year and we expect to reinvest some of those savings in the second half for the year to drive long-term growth. So you can say that there was somewhat over synergies at this point. R&D expense was 2.5% of revenue in Q2, down 10 basis points from 2.6% in the year ago quarter. Analytical technologies R&D expense was 4.8% of revenue down 40 basis points from the prior year. ", "Moving to below line items adjusted net interest expense was $23 million in Q2 up $18 million from the prior years reported. Primarily as result of merger, other income of $2 million was up $1milllion from the prior year. ", "Our adjusted tax rate was 24.2% in Q2, down from 30.6% last year for Thermo standalone and also down from our previous full year forecast to 25%. During the quarter we continue to put forward significant effort in this area, and we're successful on implementing some additional tax planning, that lowered our tax rate forecast for the year to 24.6%. ", "Average diluted shares were 446 million for the quarter, up significantly from the prior year as result of the merger. We continue to expect full year average diluted shares to be in a range of 440 million to 445 million in 2007. In terms of balance sheet performance we ended the quarter with $974 million in cash and in investment, up $283 million from Q1 primarily as a result of strong operating cash flow and option proceeds. ", "Partially offset by paying down our short-term debt. Our debt decrease by $147 million from Q1 $2.2 billion as a result of paying down short-term debt. Receivables day sales outstanding was 54 days flat with the prior year on the pro forma basis. Inventory days of supply was 76 days also flat with the prior year on a pro forma basis if you exclude the four day increase that resulted from the purchase accounting inventory step up. ", "Q2 year-to-date cash flow from continuing ops was $558 million. After deducting net capital expenditures of $58 million Q2, year-to-date free cash flow from continuing operations was $500 million. For 2007 we now expect free cash flow from continuing operations to be in the range of $1 billion net of merger related cash out flows. ", "So, let me just review with you the guidance\u2019s that we\u2019ve in our press release. We're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance's to $2.50 to $2.56 as compared to our previous guidance\u2019s of $243 to $253. Primarily as a result of our solid first half operating performance and a slightly lower tax rate. ", "This range -- represents 31% to 34 % growth over our 2006 adjusted EPS of a $91. We're also increasing our fully year revenue guidance\u2019s to $9.50 to $9.55 billion as compared to our previous guidance's of $9.4 to $9.5 billion as a result of more favorable fund exchange translation. This range represents to 7% to 8% increase over our pro forma 2006 revenues of $8.87 billion. ", "Finally, our integration project continued to progress well and a good number of them have already been completed. So we remained confident that we will achieve $75 million of synergies in 2007. So in summary, that was another excellent quarter for us in terms of growth and operational performance. We are pleased with the results and believe that we are positioned well to meet our goals in 2007. ", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Okay with that we move up to questions. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Derik De Bruin from UBS. ", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Hi, good morning. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning Derik ", "Peter Wilver", "Hi, Derik ", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "So I am going to ask you guys the, two most frequently asked questions that I guess. The first one is, that were obviously consolidating industry there is diagnostic companies is following by the website everyday and things going on all around us. I keep getting to ask, what you guys are going to do, in terms of M&A being -- I know your comment is mostly analytical technologies, give a little bit more color in terms of what you're think on M&A front? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. ", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Quickly more long line to sizable deal. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Sizable deal. Well we just, did a quite of sizable deal in November, right though and we can feel that, we are actually at the forefront of during sizable deals in our industry having just put this mergers together. And we're now, well this is our third quarter that we\u2019ve reporting as one company and you can hear that we are quite confident that we are on the right track. So I get the question I love to Derik, what\u2019s next and does the integration of Thermo and Fisher prevent you from doing other bigger deal in the near future. ", "And its sort of the answer is really, it doesn\u2019t prevent us from doing bigger deal in the future, because from a management capacity point of view some of our divisions are really not that affected by an extra work load as a result of the Fisher integration. ", "For into scientific instrument, where we have must taken a chromatography and elemental and molecular analysts is a division, there was one of the key divisions in the legacy Thermo, it\u2019s not a key division in our combined company. And it\u2019s really not that affected by, from a management point of view by the merger with Fisher. ", "And other divisions like laboratory equipment are very effective by and the acquisitions and the mergers, we\u2019ve done over the last two years. And they really need to have management focused on the implementation of the strategy and the integration. ", "So in theory it\u2019s a little good but I would say that in general and in the buyer restrains area, scientific, instrument and diagnostic, we can take on a good size acquisition if the right opportunity would come along. ", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I mean the other question I get is always on the lines of, which is you know, everybody on the buy side have or every one on the sale side has a buy stock -- obviously sale side is not that bright sometimes what we missing about it I guess what can potentially go wrong with that, what keeps you awake at night? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "I don\u2019t think there is much that can go wrong here, quite honestly because -- it is a business with 54% consumable, 16% services and software and so two third of our business is a relatively stable stream of demand, of course capital cycles are what they are, on the other hand 66% of our customer base is in life science and healthcare. ", "So I think from a market exposure point of view and a product line particularly to the high content of consumables. We are at pretty low risk enterprise. So that\u2019s not keeping me awake at night. ", "What I think a lot of about is we -- how do we truly, competitively leverage all these capabilities that we now have in the company in the most optimum way, rather than we got in this, the tremendous number of great asset, technologies, market reach through the channel, through the catalogue and all in one company now is just phenomenal in terms of its capability. ", "How do we optimally take advantage of that? We\u2019re going to take advantage of it but how do we optimally take advantage of it comparatively. That\u2019s something that we give a lot of thought to and -- our success and thinking through that will to some extent determine our success two, three four years out. But this is not a down scenario, this is more of, how good can be upside scenario be. ", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Great, thanks. I\u2019ll get back in Queue. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank. ", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Good morning, gentlemen. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning, Ross. ", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "You know that sort of strength across all markets, but I want to -- sort to focusing on, I wonder to. In terms of, the pharmaceutical strength you are seeing and this was noted by another competitor of yours as well. ", "Do you think this is sort of a recovery from the bottom where we are getting back just sort of more normalized growth level, or do you believe we\u2019re actually coming to a point, where pharma might be reaccelerating again to the degree where we could get back to more of a traditional growth rate from that market longer term? ", "So, it\u2019s a really question to sort of the sustainability of this recovery, and do we sort of come back and then flatten of or do we comeback and hopefully continue to grow? ", "Peter Wilver", "No, Ross this is Marijn, I don\u2019t -- I think its been a very gradual recovery so far. Obviously, very early on 2005 it was a disaster we remember that, and then \u201806 let me start to getting better in the second half of \u201905 or \u201906 got better again, \u201907 is better again. But this is not in my mind and inflection point to the good old day. That may come next year. ", "I actually think that when you are listing two pharma companies then they are confident that the some of the issues will be behind then within the next 12 to 18 months and that the companies will be operating more in a historical type of investments scheme from an R&D point of view. But I don\u2019t recognize what we are seeing in terms of strength of Pharma and all of a sudden inflection point with an arrow pointing up all the way to the sky, not yet. ", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities", "And could you also -- you touched upon the acquisitions bay in India, and currently you guys have done a very good job of being early in many of the emerging markets. Can you talk to us about in India, but more specifically in China what we\u2019re seeing from sort of a capital equipment investment trend line and can you talk about sort of the sustainability, the growth there. ", "I mean is there any sort of wavering in demand in that market? And given the strength of the Chinese economy, going into the Olympics, is there any opportunity potentially that we could see obviously a up tick in \u201908 versus even the strong \u201906 and \u201907? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Ross, we\u2019ll let Marc Casper answer that question. Okay? ", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Ross. In terms of China, an analytical instrument demand, it continues to be very strong. Mass Spectrometry, life science and industrial applications, food safety market continues to be strong and accelerating. The traditional strength of that, ten years elemental analysis of all varieties for infrastructure, as well as consumer product base safety applications has been incredibly strong. ", "And I actually believe that those types of products will continue to see good growth because of safety concerns. All of the scares that we read about in the paper really does reflect well on these types of products that we make. So, I think we\u2019ll see good demand. I think infrastructure for the Olympics is probably at the end of that part of the cycle, given how close for this now. ", "But we\u2019re seeing accelerating demand on instrumentation in China. In India, obviously it looks encouraging as well with the move towards more pharmaceutical outsourcing to the Indian market and that\u2019s obviously very good for our Mass Spectrometry business as well. ", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I know we are supposed to keep it to two questions. I have a quick third one Just based on what Derek said sparks something for me. What do you make of what GE and Siemens and Roche are doing from sort of an acquisition standpoint in the diagnostics space? ", "I mean you have internally within you, as you had mentioned it out in chemical pathology business, similar to Ventana and immunohistochemistry and a bunch of other diagnostic assets you got from ABgene. What do you think their strategy is? What is it due to competition and what do you think about the valuations paid for those assets relative to the intrinsic value in your business. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it\u2019s true. It\u2019s a complicated question particularly because the intent obviously was for the two-two merger, then they decide not to do it. So, you can talk from both sides of the argument. ", "Marc Casper", "And I think I\u2019m not an expert. I don\u2019t know GE what said in two years, but it makes sense for them to have a similar strategy to Siemens, which is to have a broader diagnostics platform and have imaging and clinical chemistry together in one company. In the end when you walk into a hospital you have an imaging department and you have a clinical chemistry laboratory and overtime these two will be more integrated. ", "So I can understand that\u2019s from a covering the customer based point of view. We at Thermo Fisher are doing the same thing in research laboratories. We say we like to have complimentary technology because in the end we will put a better-integrated workflow together than only just sell single individual technologies to the customer. ", "So, I can see the -- of all that and the fact that it sells through, I really don\u2019t have any inside information on why that happened, but the strategy and principle makes sense to me. In terms of what\u2019s being fate for these assets, I don\u2019t understand why people are paying the prices they\u2019re paying for these assets, because life sciences healthcare, if you are running a company, you know the market will always be there, and it will fairly stable on people getting older -- we want all -- we all will invent a medicine and hence, to be a provider to a life sciences and healthcare markets is a very good place to be. ", "So if you\u2019re GE or Siemens and you have all these choices that you can make of which different markets to participate in, I think this is one of the best. So I can understand that they are willing to pay up to a kind of bigger presence in it. ", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities", "Great. Thank you very much, guys. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. ", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning. ", "Marc Casper", "Good morning ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning, Tycho. ", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Marijn, I want you to follow up a little bit on some of your commentary around the biosciences service business, and you talked about some of the cash creating services you\u2019re offering. I guess can you just kind of give us a sense in terms of some of these expanded service offerings, what the direction anyhow this business model could take? ", "I mean obviously, you\u2019re not going to go down path of being a full fledged CRO, but this certainly, given your breadth of expertise, a lot of areas you could go in. How broadly are you looking at building up a service business and what other areas could you potentially get into? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "That\u2019s an interesting question because the funniest thing as if, you are sitting on a really exciting new technologies like RNAi, it is just unbelievable in terms of its potential. And you\u2019ll find that the customers are not experts in, how to apply this technology. ", "So, its one thing to then demonstrated in your own laboratory and show them how to use RNAi, its another thing to demonstrate. Wait a minute, if you want us to do that work for you, we can do that as well, and we have the capability and capacity to do that. So it\u2019s for us a little bit of a different model now where we are staying, we are not just out to sell you RNAi and demonstrate to you and our demo let, how to use it. ", "But if you want us to do that experiment for you, in this very-very complicated new technology, we\u2019ll do it, maybe we\u2019ll only do it for half a year and then we transition this technology and the workflow and the instrumentation and the consumables to them in their own lab. ", "Once they are comfortable with the concept. So, it\u2019s sort of an extension of a demonstration laboratory capability that is a service to the customer. And I think we will see more of that in the future because it a very good way to drive adaptation of the new technology with the customer base that\u2019s not really use to it. ", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay. And then secondly on the manufacturing side of things you talked about the disposable manufacturing container and it\u2019s been a while since we had enough data on how you\u2019re manufacturing businesses. ", "Can you just remind us, how large that business is today and I think going back my memories for bio which historically is skewed more towards the research market on the media side, is that correct? And maybe you can talk to some other trends around trends around serum-free and animal-origin-free, what direction you are hoping to take that business? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. Well we have, as a result of Fisher\u2019s for a bio acquisition and with product lines Hyclone for instance. And also, another the price of Fisher\u2019s with NALGENE and NUNC more on the bioprocess container side, both product line. ", "We have quiet a nice position in bioprocess and production support, and it goes as you say, it goes from serum, media to also the container, the bags in which the cell reactions are taking place, containers. ", "Its growing very rapidly because our biotechnology customers want to get away from steel tanks, and of a lot of regulations coming with them in terms of cleaning, and procedures and disposable reactors are really preferred lot of cost saving and lot of ease of use there. ", "So resting have very good growth trend in media and bioprocess containers driven by the ease of use for the biotech customer. ", "And then your comments on serum versus media, everybody knows that overtime animals containing serum is kind of grow less than the media. We have a position in both of these product lines and this is I think a very-very gradual transition overtime that, we\u2019re playing both sides of. ", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay, great thank you very much. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay thanks Tycho. ", "Operator", "Out next question comes from Tony Butler from Lehman Brothers. ", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Yes. Thank you. Excuse me; you alluded to the to NITON XL. And I\u2019m curious, is if fact it\u2019s true to be XRF analyzers, maybe this, one of the fastest growing products of Thermo. ", "If that\u2019s true, could you provide, what of those instruments actually cost and the reason of I\u2019m asking is because is it possible that customers even though an advantages that are portable, but is it possible that customers actually could purchase one of those instruments, which tend to be perhaps cheaper than one of the larger instruments or either a mass aspect. ", "And therefore would that eliminate, potentially eliminate the purchase of a larger or several larger instruments? Thanks. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well. For you Tony, we can get you a very good price on one of those portable analyzers. ", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, discount. Thanks. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes. We never do that for anybody else. But they are in the range of 25,000 to 30,000 to 35,000 something that\u2019s very high and maybe a little higher. And basically these are analyzers that you can, its almost like a hair blowers, its like you hold it against the surface and it will tell you almost in sententiously what elements, what metals in particular are in that surface, in the specimen, in very high accuracy. So you can find out whether area is let in paint or whether are not. We could even go a restaurant and point it out at the fish you ordered and see, thus mercury in the fish. ", "That, how precise these instrument are? They are not really replacing mass spec because our large laboratory instrument because those are very often used for even more precise, and high throughput type of experiments like in a lot of quality lab they have an elemental analyzer, and they\u2019re going to do 4000 samples a day, high throughput all kinds of quality samples from all over the place. ", "Its going to be impossible to go and put a gun like that, portable analyzer again for all of these 4000 samples. So, it is a little bit of a different application, but the important part is that its an application now, where in the field people get immediate feedback of what, substances are in the sample that they are looking at, which is very important for environmental applications, Homeland Security Safety application like its lead in paint take sample. ", "In France there is legislation that you cannot paint over paint that has lead in it, so if a painter comes in to your house, so you need to know whether or not the existing paint layer has lead in it. Well, if you have to scrape up a of piece of paint, send it to a lab and get the result, two days later that\u2019s pretty inconvenience for that French painter. Now they\u2019ve put that portable X-ray analyzer then they get an instantaneous result. ", "So those type of markets we\u2019ve now sort of -- are now able to address that really didn\u2019t exist before and you\u2019re right, its one of our fastest growing product line. ", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks very much Marijin. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Hey, thanks Tony. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg from Merrill Lynch. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a fantastic quarter. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you, John. ", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I just want to spend a little more time on the 60% your business on the lab products and services. Can you just, I know a large portion of that is more based in the U.S. so the 6% number? Can you just give me a sense as to organically, what that number was as far as growth this quarter? ", "Peter Wilver", "Organically in laboratory product and services, that was 4%. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "4%? ", "Peter Wilver", "Yeah. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And can you spread a little more color, the margin expansion there was phenomenal at 13.9%. Can you just maybe break out; I know you mentioned integration, procurement sourcing and a productivity enchancement. So, if you can give a little more color as to what -- if you can break out individually, what each contributed? ", "Peter Wilver", "We really don\u2019t give the detailed analysis of what the margin expansion is. It\u2019s pretty balanced between those elements. We focused on price obviously that\u2019s a little bit offset by inflation. Certainly, the organic growth brings through at a -- closed to a gross margin pull through. And then, certainly we have productivity, and integration initiatives that impact both segments, as well as, the corporate expenses. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Pretty balanced I guess with the... ", "Peter Wilver", "Yeah, I would say one quarter and other might shipped a little bit, but it\u2019s reasonably balance in terms of the contribution to the margin expansion. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, may be either -- you made this comment but you and Marijin can discuss. You mentioned North America was a little weaker at least relative to the company average. ", "You have more exposure to the lab product services, but may be expand a little more as to what you\u2019re seeing in North America, and maybe why it\u2019s going a little below the company average in your view? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. This is Marijn. North America was very strong last year, and Europe was just beginning to recover last year. And I think you see somewhat in the general economy that particularly Europe is now little stronger than -- a stronger momentum than the U.S. ", "And then Asia is going quite steady at very good rate. But I think we see an overall reflection of little bit of the economy there where Europe is growing somewhat faster than U.S. at this point. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So it's sound just accomplish, or is needed to build on little of our academic and government, I think you mention -- still kind of more meager growth that you feeling, is there anything is going to changes there or that environment still stays the same? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "No, I mean I think the NIH budget is what it is, that\u2019s probably will grow another 1% or 2%. So you know it is what it is. You know what we often forget and as I said this a few time, you cannot just focus on the NIH budget when you think about academic or government spending particularly academic. ", "Because we benefit a lot from donations and in Life Science\u2019s areas, their people donating $10 million - $20 million and new labs gets build for Cancer Research or whatever and those -- part of that money flows to us as well. ", "And nobody is really keeping track of that, but it I think does help the overall academic spending. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "But you -- one smaller company yesterday, thought that they felt like maybe government was in academic, where some of the per stings are being loose in the little bit necessarily seeing any change there from a larger, a broader prospective. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "No. It\u2019s very high for us to break that all down with ultimate precision acquire. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Al right. For your better prospect hence for that? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Thanks. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. Thank John. ", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W Baird. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "Hi. Good morning. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "Mike, congratulations on the nice quarter. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "With respect to the China and India, then so much talk about that being one of the faster growing geographies, so much competition is going over there. How do you view yourself is? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "To maintain in that competitive advanced, glowing faster in the markets there, is it through moves like the acquisitions that you made, and just making sure that you have an established position there or can new companies come in there and still take share? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I think in those countries, scale is important, anybody can sell something in Boston or San Jose any small company can, but the ability particularly I am talking of western base company European or the U.S., to go and drive revenue growth in China or a place like India, you really have to have a significant support structure in play. ", "Not just about the sale of something, but also deserve the support -- the demo labs even local manufacturing. So I thing part of the reason we are seeing lot of consolidation smaller companies being bought up by larger company\u2019s is the market as become so global that it become hard to a smaller company\u2019s to service \u2013 you know the far away market. ", "And therefore \u2013 you know is like an acquisition Qualigens for us in India make us bigger in India -- first of all it\u2019s a good company but it give us scale more present and as a results of that more people on the ground, more assets, more customer connectivity and I think, overtime that helps particularly in emerging you know higher growth areas like China and India. ", "And that\u2019s why we have traditionally particularly with China, but also with India and years ago, I\u2019m talk three, four years ago good quite a lot of investment in the ground. And for that reason, didn\u2019t payout in the first week -- but we're just paying out now. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "Thank you. And then Pete just a repeat. That did you say that you expect for the full year tax rate of about 24.6%? ", "Peter Wilver", "That\u2019s Correct. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "And so, is that reasonable then to take that forward. ", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "All right. And any update on the vitality index. ", "Peter Wilver", "It\u2019s around 23% year to date. ", "Quintin Lai - Robert W Baird", "All Right. Thank you. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Knight with Thomas Weisel. ", "Paul Knight - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I lost to get into queue quick contest, didn\u2019t I Marijn. A peak what are you \u2013 where are we with operating margins with the combined organization so, thermal when the past whatever Q3 that was you know ops margins and Q3 would be down. What do we have for margins in second half now? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, you know, obviously, as I said in the beginning of the call that the variations quarter-to-quarter is little bit dampened. But I would save for the second half we still have an impact \u2013 relatively soft Q3 because of Europe and then a rebound in Q4, but just not as pronounced that it use to be just for standalone Thermo. Both put in the top-line as well as margins. ", "Paul Knight - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And Marijn you were selling some service companies I think seven years ago, now you don\u2019t seem to be interested in doing that you wanted to be in it, right? I mean what\u2019s going on now versus then that you want to be a service firm as well? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, which company are you referring to, Lancaster Labs? ", "Paul Knight - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Yeah. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "That wasn\u2019t me. At that time, Thermo needed to focus on core, these seven years ago when we were 24 public companies. And we decided to just focus on instruments, we then \u2013 when we recognized our huge installed base started driving surface support for our customers more and more because quite honestly we would have instrumentation or equipment that we don\u2019t even offer our customers of service contract in the original quote when we were selling something that\u2019s been those days. So we have been since then focused on service. ", "I think that does Fisher had a much broader service model and driven by an initially the catalog business and been still close to the customers in the laboratories and seeing what they were struggling with so Fisher really picked up for instance the support in clinical trials particularly from, the packaging point of view. So they\u2019ve picked up some very good services businesses that we are now very intend on growing and those are doing very well. ", "Paul Knight - Thomas Weisel", "Okay. And lastly are you, back to the first question are you saying that we should build in sequential declining our margin and revenue for Q3? ", "Marc Casper", "I am not going to direct you what to put in your model, but just on a relative basis I was saying that Q3 is still a weaker quarter and Q4 is a stronger quarter even for the combined company. ", "Paul Knight - Thomas Weisel", "Yes, Okay. Thanks. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you Paul. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Sullivan with Leerink Swann ", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Hey, guys good morning. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning John. ", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Couple of quick questions can you just post us on pressures on the material side of the business you would talked in the past of having good pricing power, but needing good pricing power in some businesses because materials prices continued to pressure you, can you just post us on that? ", "Marc Casper", "Yes, John it\u2019s a very important question because we feel more and more pressure particularly on the metal sides steel, copper, nickel very expensive, so we are clearly seeing inflationary pressures in products that\u2019s use a lot of metal. ", "Fortunately we\u2019ve always been very focused on pricing as well so we\u2019re trying to pass that on as best as we can, but the inflation but the inflation and pressures is quiet significant. Interestingly, more so on the metals than it is on oil based products, so we see some inflationary pressure on things like plastics, as well, which obviously we use for the consumables the laboratory consumables business, and but less sold than metal. ", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Appreciate that. And then did you, I think in the past I\u2019ve talked about your natural hedge so that\u2019s in your business from your business which customers that are positively correlated with commodity prices minding an energy alike, can you remind us what percentage of your revenues come from those type of customers? ", "Peter Wilver", "Its was pretty low now it was I\u2019d say about 10% in legacy turnover and is less than 5% now, so still they\u2019re doing very well and we liked our business so there\u2019s somewhat of the hedge effect, that does not I think as it used to be. ", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "I understand. And lastly if you don\u2019t mind, you talked in last quarter about the coal plant mercury monitoring opportunity that you see, can you just, is there any update on that? And then can you just help us on think about how an opportunity like that might find its way into other markets? Does it have to happen by regulation in other markets or does it happen by through other means? And can you comment on, what that might be? ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes, this is the mercury continues monitoring system that you are talking about, every coal fired power plant in the United States needs to monitor its mercury emission, by January 1st 2009, okay. So we are one of two companies that has been approved by the EPA to sell these systems to the coal-fired power plants. And we have a beautiful system and the demand is really phenomenal for it. We\u2019re doing very well. Nice growth. But it\u2019s sort of a -- it\u2019s a single market. ", "After 2009, in the United States, people aren\u2019t going to install these things anymore. They\u2019ll service -- they need to service for them, but not the original equipment. And this only translates when this type of legislature would be implemented in Europe or in China or Russia or somewhere else. So this is really legislation driven. ", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Thanks very much. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thanks, John. ", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) ", "Marijn Dekkers", "We have time probably for just one quick question. ", "Operator", "I am not showing any other question, Sir. ", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. Well, let me wrap up the call then. Thank you very much everybody for being on the call. I think you can see that with our excellent performance we are showing that we\u2019ve stuck successfully, come together as one company now, Thermo Fisher Scientific. ", "And we plan to build on this strong foundation. By really leveraging all of the capabilities we have to better serve our customers. And we really look forward to updating you on our progress. So thank you, again and thanks for your support. ", "Marc Casper", "Thank you. ", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation in today\u2019s conference.

I wouldlike to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, VicePresident, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the calltoday, we have Marijn Dekkers, our President and Chief Executive Officer, MarcCasper, Executive Vice President, and Pete Wilver, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live andwill be archived on our website thermofisher.com, until November 23, 2007. Toreach the replay of the call on our website, click on \"investors,\"then \"webcast,\" then \"presentations.\"", "Please also be aware that a copy of the press releasesetting forth our third quarter 2007 earnings and future expectations isavailable in the investor section of our website under the heading quarterlyresults.", "We\u2019d like to begin the call by reading the Safe Harborstatement. Various remarks that we may make about the company\u2019s futureexpectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements forpurposes of the Safe Harbor provisions underthe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated bythese forward-looking statements, as a result of various important factorsincluding those discussed in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June30, 2007, under the caption, risk factors, which is on file with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission and available in the investor section of our website,under the heading \"SEC Filings.\"", "We also may make forward-looking statements about thebenefits of the merger of Thermo Electron and Fisher Scientific, includingstatements about future financial impacts on operating results, the new company'splans, objectives, expectations, and intentions and other statement that arenot historical facts.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements atsome point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so,even if our estimates change, and therefore, you should not rely on theseforward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequentto today.", "Also during this call, we\u2019ll be referring to certainfinancial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally AcceptedAccounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP financialmeasures used on this call to the most directly comparable GAAP measures isavailable on the press release setting forth our third quarter 2007 earningsand future expectations and in the tables accompanying such releases in the \"investors\"section of our website, www.thermofisher.com, under the heading \"quarterlyresults.\"", "Related information is also available on the \"investor\"section on our website under the heading \"webcast and presentations.\"", "With that, I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning to all of you listening in. Thanksfor joining us. We have very good news to report to you again this quarter. Asyou can saw in the press release, we had record third quarter financialperformance.", "We are about two weeks away from the one year anniversary ofthe Thermo Fisher merger, and the success of our integration can be seen in ourstrong operating results. The business is doing well; our key end markets arehealthy, and we have the resources to invest in internal initiatives as well asacquisitions that will lead to future growth.", "Let me get right to the Q3 highlights. As I have doneearlier, I\u2019m going to compare our revenues and adjusted operating resultsexcept for EPS on a pro forma basis, as if Thermo and Fisher were combined forall of 2006.", "So revenues grew 7% to a record 2.4 billion. Adjusted EPSwas also a record for the quarter, increasing 48% to $0.65. Adjusted operatingincome rose 17%. We also had an excellent quarter of adjusted operating marginexpansion, up 150 basis points to 16.9%, and there are several reasons for ourconsistent margin improvement.", "First, we are fully leveraging our top line growth includingdriving price. Second, we\u2019re on track delivering the synergies from the mergerwith Fisher. And as you know, in 2007 most of those are cost synergies. Third,we continuously improve our productivity through our company-wide PracticalProcess Improvement program called PPI, which has now been rolled out in all ofthe legacy Fisher businesses. And then fourth, another contributor to ourmargin expansion is that we have undertaken an initiative across the company todiscontinue low or no profit product lines. ", "With our gross portfolio, there are some unattractiveproduct lines and rationalizing those gives us an opportunity to be morefocused on our strong products. This obviously improves our margins even thoughit creates some headwinds for revenue growth.", "So let me give you a brief update on our primary markets.Again no significant change from what we saw in the first half of the year. Ourgeneral end markets remain healthy, biotech still strong, big pharma is stablewith spending levels similar to what we\u2019ve seen so far this year.", "BioPharma outsourcing services is experiencing double-digitgrowth. Clinical diagnostics is growing well. Academic is growing at averagelevels. Government is declining, and environmental sees very strong growth,especially in air quality in the United States. And then thequestion I get to be asked a lot. We still see no signs of weakness in theglobal commodities markets.", "Let me comment a little bit on acquisitions. We continue tostrengthen our presence by making acquisitions that compliment on our existingcapabilities. As we stated in the press release, since August we\u2019ve completedacquisitions totaling nearly $200 million in annualized revenues.", "The life laboratory and health sciences industry remainshighly fragmented, and that gives us opportunities to create value by acquiringbusinesses that offer global expansion, or new commercial capabilities, orcomplementary technologies, or any combination of these factors.", "So let me give you some highlights of our recent activity.First, Qualigens, this acquisition closed in September, and Qualigens is thelargest laboratory chemical supplier in India formerly owned byGlaxoSmithKline. Qualigens is now part of our customer channel business forresearch markets, and it significantly expands our laboratory, chemicalsofferings and our customer base in a high growth Asian market.", "Secondly, in early September, we acquired the instrumentsales business of Davis Inotek. Davisis also being integrated into our customer channels business and broadens ourportfolio with a range of specialty instruments and consumables for researchand industrial process application.", "Thirdly, Priority Solutions, which closed in early October.Now this one is exciting because it strengthens the outsourcing services thatwe can offer our biotech and big pharma customers for clinical trialsmanagement. Priority Solutions has a great logistics infrastructure that we canuse to deliver clinical trial supplies to the patients participating in thoseclinical trials.", "Fourthly, a good example of a technology acquisition isNanoDrop, which we just completed a couple of weeks ago. NanoDrop expands ourUV-vis portfolio with instrumentation that can analyze micro volume samples.This is important because life sciences research that involves measuring DNAand proteins require scientists to work with very small samples, and that makessample preparation difficult.", "NanoDrop specific technologies allow our customers to easilyanalyze micro samples without having to dilute them, leading to better resultsand greater lab productivity. So, quite a few of these bolt-on acquisitionsmaterialized recently, and I am not saying we are going to keep up this spaceof acquisitions, but we expect to continue doing these type of bolt-onacquisitions on a regular basis.", "A few comments on our internal investments. Our acquisitionscompliment significant internal investments we make to better serve ourcustomers and position the company for long-term growth. Just let me mention afew. One is employee development, which is a very important component of themerger integration, particularly, driven to cultural integration.", "We\u2019ve spent a lot of time training our employees to helpthem add depth to our company-wide processes. And this ranges all the way fromhigh level leadership training for managers to training in our PPI productivityprogram for all employees. And I am extremely pleased with how well this hasgone, and of course, it's an ongoing process.", "Then technology development, our R&D track recordcontinues to distinguish us in the industry. And we are getting better andbetter at targeting our research dollars to the most promising application.", "Our product vitality for the Analytical Technology segmentis 23% year-to-date. This is the percentage of revenues we generated in thatsegment from products introduced in the past two years. Recent new products,such as the three mass spec systems we launched at ASMS and the new RNAi platform we announced this week, will contribute to thatmetric going forward.", "In other area where we are investingheavily internally is in sales and marketing. We\u2019re placing a great deal ofattention to initiatives that strengthen our commercial presence and help usdrive revenue synergies across the company. Examples of that include newtools for training our sales people, key account management and leveraging ourcustomer channels and global presence, and then last capacity expansion.", "We\u2019re investing in new facilities that will allow us to meetcustomer demand for our products and services. And let me mention two here thatwe recently announced.  One project is inour Biosciences business. We have committed $11 million to build a newBioSensor in Utahfor the manufacture of our BioProcess products. We continue to see excellent growth here especially in BioProcessingcontainers.", "There are currently thousands of new biotech drugs in thepipeline, and our single-use containers help our customers eliminatecontamination during the processing of drugs under development. Over the nextfour years, we plan to add 90,000 square feet of capacity at that site in Utah.", "The other expansion project that I would like to mention isin India, where we are building a $17 million facility that will supportgrowing demand for our BioPharma services in that country.", "As we\u2019ve mentioned before, it\u2019s estimated that nearly 25% ofall clinical trial patients will be in India by the year 2010. This100,000 square foot facility will be used to package and distribute thepharmaceutical supplies that patients need in India and other parts of the world.", "So we feel we are in an enviable position with the resourcesdoing best in both external and internal growth drivers. And this gives us anumber of options for creating value for all our stakeholders, employees,customers and investors.", "So with that I would like to quickly comment on the guidancebefore I hand over the call to Pete Wilver.", "With three quarters behind us, we obviously have betterfeasibility to our full year results. And based on three quarters this year,three record quarters, we are again raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2007.We are raising the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 and expectour performance for the year to be in the range of $2.56 to $2.59. And thisincrease would result in 34% to 36% growth in adjusted EPS over our excellentperformance in 2006.", "We are also raising our revenue guidance by a $100 millionto a range of $9.60 to $9.65 billion. And this would lead to a revenue increaseof 8% to 9% over 2006. So with that, I will turn over the call to Pete Wilverfor more details on our financials. Pete?", "Pete Wilver", "Thanks, Marijn. Good morning, everyone. As we did lastquarter to provide better year-over-year comparisons, the revenue and adjustedoperating income numbers as well as the working capital metrics that I\u2019lldiscuss with you today will be presented on a pro-forma adjusted basis as ifThermo and Fisher have been combined in all of 2006.", "Comparisons on below the line items such as interest, taxes,share count and earnings per share will be discussed on an adjusted basis asreported.", "As Marijn said, our adjusted earnings per share for thequarter grew 48% to $0.65 compared to $0.44 in Q3 last year. We have increasedour full year guidance to reflect our solid Q3 results and increase confidencein meeting our annual earnings goals. I will cover our revised guidance in moredetail at the end of my comments.", "GAAP earnings per share in Q3 were $0.49, up from $0.30 inthe prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of increased earnings from themerger, improved operating performance and a lower tax rate including aone-time favorable adjustment of $0.05 in 2007. These items are partially offsetby higher acquisition, intangibles amortization.", "Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation betweenGAAP and adjusted EPS. Revenues in Q3 increased 7% year-over-year to $2.40billion. Organic revenues in the quarter were up 5%, excluding favorablecurrency translation of 2%. There was no material impact in the quarter fromnon-Fisher merger related acquisitions and divestitures. During the quarter,bookings slightly exceeded revenues again, by just under 1%.", "In the Analytical Technology segment, revenues rose 12% on areported basis and almost 7.5% organically. In the quarter, we saw a stronggrowth across all of our major markets including life sciences, diagnostics andindustrial. In addition to the market strength, our new product introductionsalso continued to be a key growth driver, specifically in our mass spectrometry,elemental analysis and environmental product lines.", "In the laboratory products and services segment, revenuesfor the quarter increased 4% both on a reported basis and organically. We sawgrowth across most of our major market segments, with continued strength in BioPharmaoutsourcing services.", "By geography, we saw organic growth across all our majorregions. North America grew organically atslightly above the company average, and Asia Pacific grew at more than doublethe company average. Europe and the rest ofthe world grew in the low single-digits against particularly strong growth inthe year ago quarter.", "In terms of operating income, Q3 adjusted operating incomeincreased 17% year-over-year to $405 million. Adjusted operating margin was16.9%, up 150 basis points from 15.4% in the year-ago quarter on a pro formabasis.", "Stock compensation expense was $13 million in Q3, as comparedto $19 million in the prior year on a pro-forma basis, which contributed 30basis points to the year-over-year margin expansion in the quarter. The balanceof the margin expansion came from pull through on our incremental organicrevenues and the impact of our integration, sourcing and productivityinitiatives.", "Analytical technologies Q3 adjusted operating incomeincreased by 26% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 19.4%, up210 basis points versus 17.3% last year.", "Laboratory product and services Q3 adjusted operatingincome, increased by 10%, and adjusted operating margin increased by 70 basispoints to 14%, as compared to 13.3% in the prior year.", "Adjusted gross margin was 40.8% in Q3, up 100 basis pointsfrom 39.8% in the year-ago quarter. Primarily as a result of price increasesnet of inflation, volume leverage, and the impact of outsourcing andproductivity initiatives. ", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.5% of revenue in Q3, down 40 basispoints from 21.9% in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of volumeleverage, integration synergies, and lower stock compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.4% of revenue in Q3, flat with theyear-ago quarter. Analytical Technologies R&D expense was 4.9% of revenue,also flat with the prior year. As I\u2019ve mentioned previously, analytical technologiesrepresents about 80% of our R&D spend for the company.", "In terms of below the line items, adjusted net interestexpense was 19 million in Q3 up $12 million from the prior year as reported,primarily as a result of the merger. Other income of $1 million was flat withthe prior year.", "Our adjusted tax rate was 24.6% in Q3, consistent with ourQ2 rate, and down significantly from 30.6% last year for Thermo standalone.It\u2019s important to note that the one-time tax benefit of $0.5 this quarter thatwas mentioned in our press release and earlier in my comments, did not affectour adjusted tax rate. It\u2019s only reflected in our GAAP tax rate.", "Average diluted shares for the quarter were 447 million,essentially flat with the prior quarter and up significantly from the prioryear as result of the merger. During the quarter, we used approximately $540million of our $1 billion share buyback authorization to repurchase 10.1million shares. We continue to expect full year average diluted shares to be ina range of 440 million to 445 million for the full year of 2007.", "In terms of balance sheet performance, we ended the quarterwith $846 million in cash and in investment, down $128 million from Q2,primarily as a result of share repurchases and acquisitions partially offset byour strong operating free cash flow and option proceeds.", "Our debt was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $2.2billion. Receivable DSO was 55 days, up one day from the prior year on a pro-formabasis, and inventory days of supply was 76 days, also up one day from the prioryear on a pro forma basis, if you exclude the four day increase that resultedfrom the purchase accounting inventory step up.", "Q3 year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations, as Imentioned, was very strong at $950 million. After deducting net capitalexpenditures of $103 million Q3, year-to-date free cash flow from continuingoperations was $847 million. As a result of our strong cash flow performanceyear-to-date, we now expect 2003 cash flow from continuing operations to be inthe range of $1.1 billion net of merger-related cash flows.", "So, let me just review the guidance with you that we have onour press release. We're increasing our adjusted EPS to a range of $2.56 to$2.59, as compared to our previous guidance of $2.50 to $2.56, primarily as aresult of our strong Q3 operating results and better visibility on our expectedQ4 results. This range represents 34% to 36% growth over our 2006 adjusted EPSof a $1.91. ", "We're also increasing our full year revenue guidance by a$100 million to a range of $9.60 to $9.65 billion, as compared to our previousguidance of $9.50 to $9.55 billion, as a result of acquisitions and morefavorable foreign currency translations. This range represents an 8% to 9%increase over our pro-forma 2006 revenues of $8.87 billion.", "Finally, our integration projects continue to progress well,and a good number of them have already been completed. So we remain confidentthat we will achieve at least $75 million of adjusted operating income synergiesin 2007.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator forQ&A.", "Question-and-AnswerSession", "Operator", "Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comesfrom Paul Knight of Thomas Weisel Partners. Your line is open.", "Paul Knight - ThomasWeisel Partners", "Hi, Marijn.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning Paul.", "Paul Knight - ThomasWeisel Partners", "Can you talk about the dynamics going on right now at Fisherspecifically the slowest business has been the laboratory furniture area. When shouldwe expect to see maybe some synergies between this year and the prior ThermalElectron I guess is the summary?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah, this question goes back to Fisher Hamilton, which wasput in discontinued operations by Fisher prior to the merger and when we did themerger a year ago we took it out of discontinued operation. We have seen somevery good collaboration between that business and our Basic LaboratoryEquipment and Consumables business. Lot of passing on of leads and because asyou know the Laboratory Furniture Business is basically the first contact thatwe have with a customer that is going to build a new laboratory. Having thatcontact and with the lead passed on to Laboratory Equipment leads to sort of arunning start talking to that customer about equipping the lab not just nowbuilding the lab and putting furniture in. So, we expect overtime from theseleads to get revenue synergy.", "Paul Knight - ThomasWeisel Partners", "And then, last, Marijn, the guidance implies maybe a littlemore organic growth in the fourth quarter, what's going on to do that?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, the guidance doesn\u2019t really imply more organic growthin the quarter. The increased guidance on EPS is really the result of theearnings momentum that we have had so far in the year. We had another very,very strong margin expansion quarter in Q3. And we think that will continue inQ4. So it\u2019s more a comment on the overall earnings capability of the company.", "Paul Knight - ThomasWeisel Partners", "Okay. Thanks.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank.Sorry, if I mispronounced your last name.", "Ross Muken - DeutscheBank", "Thank you. Congratulations, guys on a very strong quarter.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you, Ross.", "Ross Muken - DeutscheBank", "As we look, more to your comments at the beginning of thecall. You noted that Pharma was stable and that Biotech continues to be strong.We\u2019ve had a fair amount of management change in the last year and a half inboth those industries there has been a major restructuring effort. Are westarting to see any sort of change in strategy relative to purchasing or theirapproach to how they will go about the procurement process or are we still sortof, in a stage where they are still trying to figure out things internally andreally have it necessarily bought into the one-stop shop type of view?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it\u2019s very dependent on which pharma company you aretalking about there is a whole difference in focus on these type ofopportunities. We have some companies who embrace us and the approach that weare bringing in helping them do more consolidated purchasing, and then we alsohave some pharma companies who basically just haven\u2019t made something like thisa priority.", "So it\u2019s a very broad range of responses. I would saytypically that the companies, who aren\u2019t going through some other major type ofturmoil, are the ones that have most capacity to focus on what we can bringthem. So the ones who basically are doing the best are having the time to alsofocus on this it seems, and others who are really struggling find it harder tomake the time to change the way they are purchasing.", "Ross Muken - DeutscheBank", "And relative to your comment on the commodity market, as welook at the emerging markets in general. Have we continued to see a broadeningout of demand across customer segments, not just only related to some of thecommodity or industrial related groups within some of theses fast growingcountries and have we seen any impact from some of the scares in Chinarelative to food quality or safety quality of consumer goods?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. Absolutely, China initially was very much of agrowth pattern that supports their infrastructure build-outs of cement andsteel and mining and refineries and things like that, that really help thembuild-out their infrastructure. But we are seeing much more demand now in LifeSciences, in hospitals or academic labs that are being built. Food safety isbecoming clearly more of an issue. And that will take off over the next fewyears, not necessarily in Q3.", "In Q3 we saw more demand on customers of those Chinesecompanies in Western countries who are trying to put a sort of a quick analysisin place to find out, did they buy something that was heavily contaminated.But, at the source, where the stuff is really being made in China, we expect to see significantinvestments over the next few years.", "And then India,really the demand there is heavily on the Life Sciences side, more so then onthe infrastructure build-out side. As I mentioned we are doing an expansionthere to support clinical trials, lot of CRO type of laboratories, contractlaboratories being built there to support these clinical trials. So that helpsthe demand over there.", "Plus the generic pharma companies in India who decided a few years ago,not just to meet to generic drugs but to start trying to get the [dose] in drugdevelopment. They are also building drug development laboratories, so LifeSciences demand in Indiais really very significant from a growth point of view.", "Ross Muken - DeutscheBank", "And just one quick housekeeping question. You mentionedproduct discontinuations on the call, was there any impact in the quarter, andhow should we think about modeling that going forward?", "Marijn Dekkers -President & CEO", "Well as we try to talk about the modeling going forward, butI will give you an example of actually Paul Knight asked about laboratoryworkstations. Now laboratory workstations was a business that wasn't doing allthat well, and basically was a breakeven business. We have looked at this, wehave made it the pride of the company, but we also said they have been doingsome business that we really shouldn't be involved in it. We don't make anymoney on it; it\u2019s not good business, let\u2019s rationalize certain product lines.", "As a result of that, you, of course, got headwind from anorganic growth point of view, quite significant in laboratory workstations casebecause it\u2019s a $200 million business, but we have now gotten them into aprofitability profile in the mid-teens on operating margin rather than breakevenso they are contributing beautifully now to EPS. So, that creates someheadwinds from an organic revenue point of view, and we are doing that in aselect number of businesses where we have an underwhelming product lines, andit\u2019s not a huge number, but if you want to quantify it maybe 0.5% or so ofrevenue growth that's holding us back.", "Ross Muken - DeutscheBank", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin of UBS. Yourline is open.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Hi, good morning.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good morning.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Given the huge growth in outsourcing, both the broad anddomestically, I mean, would Thermo consider moving more aggressively into thesera space?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it\u2019s a very big industry with a few different aspects,Derik. We really like to part that we are in because of it\u2019s really in linewith our strength, which is the packaging, the distribution and logistics ofsamples that are being used, which is high precision work, and it helps usleverage the legacy Fisher capability of getting the right stuff to the rightpeople at the right time, so to speak.", "So that\u2019s part of it. We have a very strong position and weare building out organically like the India investment is in line with that andthe priority solutions acquisition, but to go beyond that and become a more ofa CRO is not really a high priority for us.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay and just a follow-up on Ross\u2019s question. So, if I heardyou correctly, you said you had about a 0.5% headwind from discontinuedproducts sort of plough in this quarter?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I don\u2019t want to give you sort of an exact number, butwhat Ross asked, what is the impact roughly of that, now and going forward for thenext quarters, and I would say, yeah, that\u2019s about the number.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. But I guess you are still confident on your numbersfor looking into 2008 and even from your analysis view in the 6% to 7% range?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. I mean that\u2019s certainly what we are targeting.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. And likewise for the 6% range for 2007 as well?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, again, it\u2019s certainly what we are targeting. We did inQ1 and Q2, 6% organic growth, in Q3 5%. So yeah, it\u2019s going to come outsomewhere between 5% and 6% for the year. But, again, I would emphasize thatthese fluctuations quarter to quarter from an organic growth point of view aregoing to happen. It\u2019s not an exact science here of us being able to mail acertain number consistently every single quarter, so there are going to befluctuations quarter-to-quarter in organic growth.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. Thank you, Derik.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird.Your line is open.", "Quintin Lai - RobertW. Baird", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations on the quarter andcongratulations on the approaching anniversary of the merger.", "Marijn Dekkers", "", "Thank you, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "", "Now that you've delivered so well on the 2007 metrics, couldyou kind of give us a glimpse a little bit about the 2008 synergies that youtalked about when you did the deal last year, and in that light some ofdivestitures that you\u2019re doing now. Is that just kind of being proactivetowards those 2008 goals?", "Marijn Dekkers", "", "Yeah. We\u2019re not really doing divestitures. To make sure wehave been doing these bolt-on acquisitions we\u2019re not really doing divestitures,that the product rationalization that I was referring to is more of an internaldiscontinuation of certain product lines, but we don\u2019t divest those businesses.", "Quintin Lai - RobertW. Baird", "", "Understand.", "Marijn Dekkers", "So 2008, and the synergies it's going to be a little bitdifferent. On the cost side, obviously the easy stock has been done throughpeaking in the first year. If I can say it that way, and now we are moredriving synergies within certain businesses that had significant overlap,particularly in the Clinical Diagnostics and in the Laboratory Equipmentbusinesses where we had clearly overlap with some of the Fisher businesses. Andwe have cost synergies that we can drive and that's more of the 2008 costsynergies piece.", "On the revenue synergies, we\u2019ve had little revenue synergiesin 2007, again as planned but we expect to get revenue synergies in a number ofareas and one is going back to Ross\u2019s question on the large accounts. We expectovertime to gain share at the larger accounts with our consolidated approach.So that\u2019s a revenue synergy.", "We also expect overtime to be able to sell more of our selfmanufactured products through the Fisher catalogue. That is a revenue synergythat helps the earnings but not the revenue growth, because it is very often asubstitution of the sale that we were going to make anyway. It will just be asale at higher margin, because it\u2019s a self manufactured product. So you don\u2019tsee that really in the revenue line, but you do see it in the earnings line.", "And then a third part of what we will see in 2008, is aleverage of the legacy Thermo capability particularly in China and to drive more of legacy Fisher revenuein China.And along those lines we are coming out with a Chinese research marketcatalogue Fisher catalogue in Chinese very soon that we expect will help drivegrowth there.", "So cost synergy is more on the operating side rather thanthe corporate side and these revenue synergies that I was talking about thosethree areas should start to kick in the course of 2008.", "Quintin Lai - RobertW. Baird", "Thank you for that and just a follow-up. Strong cash flowgeneration, I know that you have got some bolt-on acquisitions and more targetsto come. What other areas, do you think about pouring cash either on the debtor the equity buyback side?", "Pete Wilver", "Right now, we have $1 billion share buyback authorization inplace. We used about half of that, so we'll continue use that in the future. Interms of the debt, we are basically down to our long-term debt we have noshort-term debt on the balance sheet right now. So, I wouldn't expect us to bedoing anything, in terms of buying back debt unless something significantlychanges in the economics of doing that type of activity. And then, obviously wecontinue to want to do the bolt-on type acquisitions that Marijn mentioned as ourprimarily use of the cash.", "Quintin Lai - RobertW. Baird", "Thanks Pete.", "Pete Wilver", "Okay.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thanks, Quintin.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Butler's lineof Lehman Brothers", "Tony Butler - LehmanBrothers", "Yes, good morning and thank you. Two questions Marijn. Oneis allude to synergies that relate to price and productivity. I am curious if youmaybe able to quantify the price impact that you are seeing or at least providesome qualitative comments around it? And then second one, Europemay have been slow because of the prior year-over-year compare. Can youactually comment why and I apologize for not remembering, given at least, myimpression Europe tends to be weaker in thethird quarter. I am curious what really changed from last year to this year andwhat is just the timing of some orders that came through under legacy Thermo.There really was the change from last year to this year. Thanks very much.", "Pete Wilver", "Hi, Tony, this is Pete. I\u2019ll answer the Europequestion first, I guess. Last year we had and it\u2019s not a number that was everreported because, it\u2019s a combined number for the two companies put together.But Europe growth was almost 10% last year forthe combined company.", "Tony Butler - LehmanBrothers", "Okay.", "Pete Wilver", "So obviously, that was a significant growth quarter lastyear and just created really tough comparison for us. And with the breadth ofthe company it\u2019s a lot of little things that happened last year. Not just onebig item that I could point to you and say, \u201cHey, we had this huge order thatdrove significant growth.\u201d It was just a lot of businesses, some of the morelumpy businesses that had significant revenue growth last year. Obviously westill grew off of that number, we just didn\u2019t grow as fast as the rest of thecompany.", "Tony Butler - LehmanBrothers", "Thanks, Pete.", "Pete Wilver", "Thank you.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. I will comment on the price. And in our projectionsfor synergies for the Thermo Fisher combination, we did not talk about priceupside at all. And quite honestly, we don\u2019t feel that there is an opportunityfor that. And what we have done though is we have had a lot of disciplinedfocus and analysis on pricing in general.", "Thermo used to do that on its own, Fisher used to do that onits own and we have started sharing best practices in this regard between thedifferent businesses. Just to make sure that we have a very good understandingof price points in our industry and appropriately price our products. And witha broad range of products that we have going through different channels itobviously is very important to do good analytics on your pricing strategy, andI think combining the two companies, we\u2019ve gotten even better at that than theindividual companies were before.", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Thanks, Mar.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you, Tony.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan. Yourline is open.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "", "Good morning. Thanks for taking the call.", "Marijn Dekkers", "", "Hi, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "", "Hi, following up on some of the comments you made earlierabout terming the product portfolio selectively. Has there been any change tothe underlying R&D thought process, and how you are prioritizing R&Ddollars? And if you could just comment generally on where the R&Dinitiatives are, that would be helpful.", "Marijn Dekkers", "", "Yeah. Not really, I mean maybe to a little extent. TheR&D dollars, as Pete said, are for 80% spent in analytical technologysegment. So, that\u2019s really where we interact very closely with the scientistsin really trying to bring them new technology that helps them do their researchor analysis better.", "In laboratory products and services, we are more of a sortof routine products provider and there it isn\u2019t so much the hard edge on thetechnology as it is trying to provide choice and convenience and service to thecustomer, okay?", "So on the analytical technology side, we now have anincredible portfolio, I mean we are over a $4 billion of annual sales there andreally truly a very, very strong player with capability on the hardware sidewith instruments in automations, capability on the software side with ourlaboratory information management systems, and then, as a result of thecombination with Fisher a lot of capability on the consumables and the reagentside. So this puts us in a very good position to drive what we have though alot about more integrated work flow solutions.", "And we are doing that particularly as very new and demandinglife sciences applications. So RNAi technology or stem cell research or proteinbiomarkers where people today don\u2019t have a laboratory infrastructure setup yet,it\u2019s anew application, it\u2019s very demanding, a lot of people want to get intodoing that type of work. And we can go in and really help them to put theirlaboratories together from an integrated workflow point of view swift enough.", "And then a lot of our scientist customers respond to thatvery positively because it really eliminates a big headache for them. So ourresearch hence tends to be focused on, yes we want to be best-in-class in eachof these technologies, and we\u2019re not going to give up being best-in-class inMass Spectrometry, of course. But at the same time, say somebody who buys aMass Spectrometer, what else are they using before and after that MassSpectrometer Analysis and how can we help them put that workflow to get itbetter.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "And then I guess just along those lines, what are yourlatest thoughts on the diagnostics opportunity something you\u2019d highlighted Ithink last December at the analyst meeting, and it seems like with some of therecent tuck-ins here, you know, a little bit better positioning in terms of theportfolio, what are your thoughts on that market and where you stand today?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it's a very exciting market quite honestlydiagnostics, particularly, what\u2019s been called molecular diagnostics. I thoughtall diagnostics were molecular, other than for momentarily build pressure, butit\u2019s called molecular diagnostics, and but basically it\u2019s new diagnostic testhave a lot to do with early biomarker indication for certain diseases. And wesee conversions between what's currently happening in R&D labs to R&Dtools that we are selling our R&D customers. And what's going to happen indiagnostics laboratory, 5 to 10 years down the road, because those newbiomarkers that now are being invented by scientists using our technologies aregoing to be in a clinical lab at some point in the future. And there is a conversionshappening, that we believe, we are particularly well positioned for to supportour customers in that conversions of getting something that starts today in aresearch lab into a clinical lab. So, I am excited about it; we are makinginvestments mostly organically at this point to position us to do that better.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay. And then finally, just on some of the productivityinitiatives, you\u2019ve talked in the past about sourcing and then particularlywithin China, and I think you\u2019ve set a $100 million for the year was the goal,is that still the target and how do we think about maybe the opportunity fornext year?", "Marijn Dekkers", "In terms of Chinasourcing?", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Yeah, and then, into exactly in terms of lower outsourcing?", "Marijn Dekkers", "", "Yeah, this about, our spend in China,that\u2019s not the savings, but as you know, transitioning spending from westerncountries into Chinasourced mostly component supplies. And we see continued growth of that. We nowhave four factories in China.We have one in Malaysia.We have a number of factories in low-cost countries in Asia,and we are not at full capacity there, so we are still putting more products inthere.", "And at the same time, we are expanding our sourcingorganization, not just to source for those factories, but also to sourcecomponents for western factories. And when we are able to do that we typicallyon say, a part, that\u2019s 30% or 40% savings converting it from a western supplierto a Chinese supplier. So, this is quite significant.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan", "Okay. Terrific. Thank you.", "", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg of Merrill Lynch.Your line is open.", "Jon Groberg - MerrillLynch", "Thanks. Good morning. Congratulations on another solidquarter.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you, Jon.", "Jon Groberg - MerrillLynch", "Just wanted one clarification and then I might add twoquestions there. Excuse me. On the -- for the lab products and services, kindof, your model that you presented in May was, I think, organic revenue growthof 5% to 6% for kind of \u201907 to \u201909 period. In the last couple of quarters youhave been about 4%. So, just curious some of that are discontinuations, youdidn\u2019t talk about in lab workstation, but what do you need to do to get to themore of the high-end of that range in your view?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I think that. Yeah, some of these productrationalizations are mostly happening in that area, that\u2019s one. Secondly, thisis, I believe, where we, we\u2019ll have over time the revenue synergy of an abilityto use the channels more to drive self-manufactured product.", "To what extent that really will show up in organic growth onthat I\u2019m not completely sure. Some of it will, some of it won\u2019t, but we\u2019reconfident that the combination of making those products and having thisincredible channel to a very fragmented market will help us drive growth there.", "Then in addition to the BioPharma Services business in spiteof that, which we also expect to continue to see very good growth because the bigpharma is outsourcing more and more of their clinical trial work.", "So overall, I think we\u2019re well positioned for good growth inthose segments.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So again for the lab products and services for your\u201907to \u201909, you\u2019re comfortable with the 5% to 6% organic revenue growth?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Marijn Dekkers", "That\u2019s certainly our target.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "So moving to Analytical Technologies a bit, you made thisbig investment in Utahon the bioprocess container side, can you mention maybe how BioPharmamanufacturing did this quarter, and just kind of the outlook near term, we\u2019veheard a lot from other companies and customers as well as maybe it\u2019s a bitslowing there?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah. Let me think about, I'll answer that question. Thereis one very significant transition that\u2019s going on in that marketplace and thatis that a lot of customers have the preference for new applications, new drugsgo from animal based serum to what you could say artificial media, so notanimal base. They are doing that for a number of reasons, quality control,consistency et cetera. That leads to some dislocations, in the sense that a bigcustomer could have been making a certain drug with serum and now decides tochange his methodology and make it with artificial media.", "Those discontinuations that we also see, and that leads toquite some lumpiness in the demand for those products, because in some cases ifyou had the serum business, you may not have the media business, or the otherway around if you didn\u2019t have the serum business, you can see a nice upsidebecause you now get the media business. So that\u2019s really sort of leading tosome lumpiness there.", "On the bioprocess container side, which is our increasedinvestments in Utah to expand capacity that is incredibly robust, because ifanything, we are on the right side of the equation there, people have steelreactors now and they want to go to plastic reactors, small bags or containersand disposables because that is a lot easier for them to work with. So therewas a move from steel to plastic and there is a move from serum to artificialmedia and that leads to overall lumpiness.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. So in this particular quarter on the bioprocesscontainer side you still saw good growth?", "Marijn Dekkers", "So, we saw very good growth in bioprocess containers,because we are on the good side of going from steel to plastic but our growthin serum and media was not so good because we have some dislocations with somecustomers who discontinue serum.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then, on the margin side for AnalyticalTechnologies, as I look at that internally what you were forecasting. Goodsynergies on the lab product and services, a little bit than AnalyticalTechnologies and I was just curious is that a mix impact. I know you are stillcomfortable with your longer-term targets where you can do an operating marginthere?", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah, I think you can interpret that just as a mix impact inthe quarter and we are confident with what we talked about for the longer-termfor analytical technologies as well as this year.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then last question Marijn. You talked a lot aboutM&A bolt-on acquisitions, given your size is that enough do you think tomake a small acquisitions say $30 million to $70 million, lump them into yourglobal distribution and get the synergies that you are talking about or do youlook at larger opportunities as well?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Jon, it's hard to plan acquisitions. The bolt-ons we don'treally plan, but we know there is enough availability of businesses that becomeavailable sooner or later that we know will do a few of them. I couldn't tellyou exactly which ones, but we know we will do it. For the larger ones it'sjust very unpredictable. What's going to become available, nobody really knows.Of course, we are looking and seeing what companies would be a good fit withus, but it's impossible to plan around that. I think in terms of our owncapability we are integrating quite a big acquisition here with Fisher that hasbeen going very well. We're not done with it, but we are having a solitaire ofintegration behind us, we believe. And therefore the capacity of our ownleadership team here to take on some other acquisitions, certainly is gettingbetter over time.", "Jon Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, great. Thanks, Marijn.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thank you, Jon. We have time for one more caller.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from Jon Wood of Banc ofAmerica. Your line is open.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America", "Thank you. You mentioned adding the 200 million inacquisition-related revenue since August, can you give us a sense on what youspent on those deals in aggregate?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Can we -- just a second.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah. If we don\u2019t really, it will be\u2026.", "Marijn Dekkers", "We will be doing in some case.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah, it will be included in our queue, obviously. I wouldsay you could think of it in terms of the normal multiples that we pay in termsof revenue.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America", "Okay. And then, one quick one. In the way of working capitalimprovements, what have you built into the cash flow forecast for workingcapital improvements, if any? And then, can you give us a sense of whataccounts offer the most opportunity for improvement? Thank you.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah. In terms of working capital improvement, honestly, thenumber that I am talking about it represents the usage of cash in workingcapital primarily because of the growth of the company. It basically assumesthat the days are flat year-over-year, and we don\u2019t have any operationalimprovement. I expect it will do a little better than that, but it\u2019s relativelya conservative view on the numbers. And when you say accounts, you mean,accounts that\u2019s in the balance sheet?", "Jon Wood - Bank of America", "Yeah. Just payables, receivables, ", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah. I would say definitely in receivables and inventory,we have a pretty good opportunity to improve our days. As we grow obviously,that we\u2019ll use up some working capital but I think we have an ability to reducethe days down to throw off some additional cash, both inventory andreceivables.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America", "And than Pete, are those improvements are they concentratedto any one division. The legacy Fisher distributor business was prettyefficient. Is most of that opportunity in the analytical?", "Pete Wilver", "", "Yeah.I would say most of the opportunities, not necessarily just in analytical, butit\u2019s more in the manufacturing businesses and the businesses where we have acommercial structure, where you have sales offices or you have inventory allover the world and you have smaller pockets of collections, resources andthings like that.", "Asyou said the legacy Fisher businesses certainly have a lot more infrastructureand are a lot more centralized in terms of how they manage inventory andreceivables, so there is probably a less opportunity for improvement there.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America", "Great,thanks.", "Pete Wilver", "Yes.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay, so just a fewwords in closing. Obviously as you can tell from the tone of this call, we\u2019reexcited about another quarter of record performance and we also believe thatthis quarter and then the previous three quarters demonstrate the success ofthe merger integration between Thermo and Fisher.", "We will continue toleverage our broad capabilities and build on the company\u2019s position as theindustry leader, and we look forward to reporting our 2007 yearend results,as well as our expectations for 2008 in our February call.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President of Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President, Investor Relations and Treasurer", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call today, we have Marijn Dekkers, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Casper, Executive Vice President and Pete Wilver, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website thermofisher.com until March 7, 2008.

Related information is also available on the Investors section of our website, under the heading, Webcasts & Presentations.", "So with that, I would now like to turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Ken. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our review of the fourth quarter of 2007 and the full year. I am sure you have seen our press release. It was another terrific quarter and that led to a very successful year for us, our first full year as Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "So let me get right to the financial highlights for both periods. For one last time, I am going to compare our 2007 revenue and operating performance, except EPS, to 2006 pro forma results as if Thermo and Fisher had been combined for all of 2006.", "So, for the fourth quarter, revenues grew to 12% to a record $2.62 billion, adjusted EPS was also a record for the quarter, increasing 33% to $0.76. Adjusted operating income for the quarter rose 27% and we also had another excellent quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion, up 200 basis points to 17.2%. And I remember, when we really began to run this company as a unified operating company back in 2001, our operating margins were not even 10%. So I am very pleased with the terrific progress we have been able to make consistently improving our profitability. And we are able to this by fully leveraging our top line growth including driving price, by capturing synergies from the merger with Fisher and we slightly exceeded our synergy targets in 2007.", "We are continuously improving our productivity through our company-wide Practical Process Improvement program called PPI, and we are constantly reviewing our product lines to read out those with less potential in favor of strong products that will contribute to growth.", "So our strong finish in Q4 led to excellent performance for the full year. Revenues for 2007 grew 10% to a record $9.75 billion. Adjusted EPS rose 39% to a record $2.65 even better than we expected. Adjusted operating income increased 25%. Our adjusted operating margin for the year expanded by 210 basis points to 16.8%, and we also generated $1.3 billion... over $1.3 billion of free cash flow.", "So very strong results for 2007, we are firing on all cylinders. I would like to make a quick comment here on our overall strategy for managing the company, so you understand what drives the business decisions we make. Basically, we look at four key financial metrics. We look at top line growth which includes organic growth complemented by strategic acquisitions. We look at operating margins and our overall goal is to expand our margins by an average of a 100 basis points every year. We look at earnings per share and free cash flow. And the point I want to stress is that we are factoring all of these metrics while we work for fully leverage our capabilities. And that really requires a balanced approach to managing the company.", "So could we do more in any single one of those four metrics? For instance could we drive top line growth higher or just be focused on margin expansion? Absolutely. But we are not doing that, because we believe that our ability to strike a balance is further leverage the capabilities of this company most optimally, and obviously that balance is focused specifically on creating share holder value.", "Now on to the balance sheet. We ended 2007 with a very strong balance sheet and even more important for using our cash wisely. We made a number of accretive acquisitions that also added about $240 million in revenues. These acquisition give us opportunities to create value by providing complementary technologies, or new commercial capabilities or by allowing us to expand globally or really any combination of these three.", "We continued to believe that the highly fragmented life and laboratory sciences industry continues to hold opportunities for acquisitions and we will explore those that are complementary to our business. During the year 2007, we also used about $900 million of our cash to repurchase our stock. So if you added all of, it's really been an incredible year. Not only did we have exceptional financial performance but we achieve it while successfully integrating acquisitions with $6 billion in revenues. Let me tell you, it's taken a tremendous amount of effort by all of our employees and we think they should all be proud of our result.", "Through the merger Thermo Fisher Scientific is redefining what it means to be an industrial leader. I m confident that we have what it takes to sustain our growth. We have a unique combination of size and breadth, our continued innovation and a relentless commitment to serving our customers. There's is no question that with $9.7 billion of revenue we are big and that alone doesn't define an industry leader. It's how you leverage your size and portfolio breadth that matters. How do you use it to serve your customers better.", "Enabling our customers to achieve their goals drives everything we do at Thermo Fisher Scientific, from product development to our global status strategies. In 2007, we laid the groundwork for future growth by making major investments in these areas. For instance, we've spent $240 million in R&D to fuel a continuous stream of new product launches and workflow solutions on the... our Thermo Scientific brand. This broadens applications for our leading technology in mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, spectroscopy, bioreagents, RNAi technologies just to name a few. I have sworn to not give anything away, but I know that we will have a very exciting lineup of new products introductions at PITCOM next month to kick up another strong year of technology innovation.", "Our ongoing commitment to technology development complemented by strategic acquisitions will allow us to strengthen our balanced portfolio of hardware, software and consumables. Consumables now make up about half of our product mix, with instrumentation about a third and the rest being software and services. We also continue to leverage the tremendous excess we have through our customer channels. Take our Fisher catalogues for example, we are using the catalogues to give our existing customers more choices when they need to make a purchase and we are introducing new channels targeted to specific growth markets. The great example is our new research catalogue in China, which will be coming out very soon.", "So let me make a few comments on the markets. Across the company, we have great momentum going into 2008 and plenty of opportunity to build on the progress we made last year. We are hearing a lot about economic headwinds in the United States, particularly tied to industrial markets. However, we are not seeing any shift at this point that would have a major impact on our businesses, especially for the first half of the year where we have the most visibility. The life sciences markets continue to serve us well, especially biotech tie-ups are very strong and we are also working to leverage our portfolio of product and services to meet the emerging needs of our key Big Pharma customers and the CROs, to whom they are outsourcing more and more of their work.", "Environmental markets in the U.S. have remained robust with new regulations coming into play. Now we are starting to see increased attention to the environment in other parts of the world as well, such as China and expect to benefit from that, going forward. In the global industrial markets, we haven't seen any significant decline in demand and some are still quite strong such as minerals and oil and gas.", "In summary, we have a balanced portfolio and we serve a range of end markets. We believe this combination will make us less vulnerable to a slowdown in any one industry. So a comment on the guidance before I hand it over to Pete. Looking ahead to 2008, we where expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.5 to $3.15. This would lead to adjusted EPS growth of 15 to 19% over our strong performance in 2007. We expect to achieve 2008 revenues of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion, resulting in 8% to 9% revenue growth over our 2007 results.", "And with that, I will turn the call to our CFO, Pete Wilver for more details on the financials and the assumptions that were factored into our guidance for 2008. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks Marijn. Good morning everyone. As we did last quarter and for the last time as Marijn said, to provide better year-over-year comparisons, the 2006 revenue and adjusted operating income numbers, as well as the working the capital metrics that I will discuss with you today, will be presented on a pro forma adjusted basis as if Thermo and Fisher had been combined in all of 2006. Comparisons of below the line items such as interest, taxes, share-count and earnings per share will be discussed on an adjusted basis as reported.", "We had another strong quarter with 33% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.76 compared to $0.57 in Q4 last year. Full year adjusted EPS was $2.65 up 39% versus a $1.91 last year and up $0.20 from the high end of the original guidance of $2.35 to $2.45 that we gave at the beginning of the year. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 were $0.54 up from $0.08 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of increased earnings from the merger and lower merger-related charges, improved operating performance and a lower tax rate, partially offset by higher acquisition intangibles and amortization.", "Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS. Revenues in Q4 increased 12% year-over-year to $2.62 billion and we achieved full year revenues of $9.75 billion for 10% growth over our 2006 pro forma revenues of $8.87 billion.", "Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 6%, excluding favorable currency translation of 4% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 2% other than the Fisher merger. Organic revenue growth for the full year was also 6%. Bookings in the quarter were equal to revenues and exceeded revenues by slightly more than 1% for the full year.", "In the Analytical Technologies segment, revenues rose 14% on a reported basis and 7% organically. In the quarter, we saw strong growth across all our major markets, including life sciences, health care and industrial. In addition to market strength, our new products introductions also continue to be a key growth driver, specifically in a mass spectrometry, elemental analysis and environmental product lines. For the full year, Analytical Technologies grew at 14% on a reported basis and 7.5% organically.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, revenues for the quarter increased over 10% on a reported basis and 6% organically. We saw growth across most of our major market segments with continued strength in Biopharma outsourcing services as well as our research and healthcare catalogue businesses. This was partially offset by continued top line weakness in our safety catalogue and laboratory workstation businesses. For the full year, revenues in laboratory product and services grew 7% on a reported basis and 5% organically.", "Moving onto by geography, we saw organic growth across all our major regions, except in Europe which was down slightly against particularly strong growth in the year-ago quarter. North America grew at slightly above the company average, while Asia Pacific and the rest of the world grew at more than double the company average. For the full year, growth was slightly more balanced with North America growing at the company average, Europe slightly below the company average and Asia Pacific and the rest of world in the low double digits.", "Our Q4 adjusted operating income increased 27% year-over-year to $452 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.2% up 200 basis points from 15.2% in the year ago quarter on a pro forma basis. Stock compensation expense was $12 million in Q4 as compared to $18 million in the prior year on a pro forma basis which contributed 20 basis points to the year-over-year margin expansion in the quarter. The balance of the margin expansion came from pull through in our incremental organic revenues, including increased prices and the impact of our integration, sourcing and the productivity initiatives.", "For the full year, adjusted operating margins expanded by 210 basis points to 16.8% as compared to 14.7% in the prior year on a pro forma basis. Stock compensation expense was $51 million in 2007 as compared to $75 million in the prior year on a pro forma basis, which again contributed 20 basis point to the year-over-year margin expansion for the year.", "Analytical Technologies' Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 34% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 21%, up 310 basis point versus 17.9% last year. For the full year, Analytical Technologies' adjusted operating margin expanded 260 basis points to 19.8%.", "Laboratory Products and Services Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 19% and adjusted operating margin increased by a 100 basis points to 13.4% as compared to 12.4% in the prior year. For the full year Laboratory Products and Services adjusted operating margin expanded a 140 basis point to 13.6%. Adjusted gross margin was 40.9% in Q4, up 140 basis points from 39.5% in the year ago quarter on pro forma basis, primarily as a result of price increases net of inflation, volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 40.8%, up a 120 basis points from 39.6% in the prior year on a pro forma basis.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.3% of revenue in Q4, down 60 basis points from 21.9% in the year ago quarter on a pro forma basis. Primarily as a result of volume leverage, integration synergies and lower stock compensation expense. For the full year, adjusted SG&A percent of revenue improved 80 basis points to 21.5%. R&D expense was 2.3% of revenue in Q4, down 20 basis points from the year ago quarter on a pro forma basis. For the full year, R&D expense was 2.4% down 10 basis points from the prior year.", "Moving on to below the line items, adjusted net interest expense was $23 million in Q4, up $4 million from the prior year as reported, primarily as a result of the merger. Other income of $2 million was up $1 million from the prior year primarily as a result of joint venture income.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the full year was 24% down slightly from our 24.6% full year estimate at the end of Q3, which resulted in a comparatively low Q4 adjusted tax rate of 22.5%. The 2007 Q4 rate is down over 4% from the prior year, primarily as result of tax planning structures that we implemented during the year, many of which were facilitated by the merger. The decrease of 0.6% from our previous full year forecast was driven primarily by an increase in our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and a shift in our international income to lower tax rate jurisdiction.", "Average diluted shares were $441 million for the quarter, down $6 million from Q3, reflecting the benefit of the share buyback program that we initiated in Q3 and continued into Q4. For the full year, average diluted shares were $444 million. Average diluted shares for both the quarter and the full year were up significantly from the prior year as a result of the merger. During the quarter, we used $358 million to repurchase 6.3 million shares. This brings total buy backs for the year up to $898 million and 16.4 million shares", "In terms of balance sheet performance we ended the quarter with $650 million in cash and investments, down a $196 million from Q3, primarily as a result of the share repurchases and acquisitions partially offset by our strong operating free cash flow. Our debt was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 50 days, down 4 days from the prior year on a pro forma basis. And the inventory days of supply were 68 days, down 6 days from the prior year on a pro forma basis. But excluding the increase that resulted in both years from the purchase accounting inventory step up, inventory days of supply was down 3 days.", "Improvement in our working capital metrics this quarter after several quarters of flat performance was a result of continued focus on cash-cycle process improvements and best practice sharing across the company. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $1.50 billion. After deducting net capital expenditures of $156 million, full year free cash flow from continuing operations was $134 billion.", "In summary, we finished the year on a strong note and delivered solid performance for the full year across all our key metrics with top line growth of 10%, margin expansion of 210 basis points, free cash flow of over $1.3 billion which is 14% more than our adjusted net income, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 39%. So we've really delivered strong but balanced financial performance, quite a feat given the scale and complexity of the merger that we undertook just over a year ago.", "So moving on to our future guidance, we expect our strong operational performance to continue in 2008. Specifically, we are initiating a 2007 revenue guidance range of $10.5 billion to $10.6 billion which assumes no additional acquisitions or divestitures in current foreign exchange rates. This range represents an 89% increase over our 2007 revenues of $9.75 billion.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we are initiating our 2008 guidance range of $3.05 to $3.15, which represents a 15% to 19% growth over our 2007 adjusted EPS of $2.65. This guidance assumes that we will complete the remaining $100 million of our current share buyback authorization in 2008, and that our tax rate will be in the range of 24%. It does not include any other significant assumptions with regard to future acquisitions, share buybacks or other uses of our capital, with the exception of scheduled debt repayments. We also expect to see an increase in our stock compensation of expense of about $0.03 per share as compared to 2007.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question And Answer", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Hopefully, you guys can hear me, okay?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, we hear you.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "In terms of leading into the quarter, investors had a lot of concern around the organic growth rate. There was lot of trepidation about the overall performance of the business. Obviously very strong quarter. Marijn, you commented on some of the other metrics that are key and important. Is there any change from what we saw heading into 07, throughout 07 now under your first pro forma year in the company, and sort of the end market demand in any of the key segments as we head into 08 and then secondarily, now that you had the business for a year as well, how you would characterize the visibility and the capital equipment exposure that you had in the old Thermo business with the new Thermo Fisher Scientific business?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Yes, good morning Ross. Your first question about when we were here a year ago and we were looking at the markets vis-\u00e0-vis how we were looking at the markets right now, I would say as I mentioned in my comments that anything that's life sciences or healthcare related, is really very similar to a year ago. There is really not any significant change. I would say that from an industrial and environmental point of view, there is today more emphasis and more demand in the areas of food quality and microbiology. A lot of stuff happened in 2007 with respect to concerns along the food chain. So I would say that's definitely stronger and then, of course, as I mentioned, maybe the commodity materials will... the market will at some point get weaker, even though we have not seen any signs of that in our demand from those customers at this point. Go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And on the visibility side?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well on the visibility. We are now 50% consumables and as I mentioned, about a third instrumentation hardware and then the rest of it is services and software. And typically, the backlog you have in consumables is shorter than on the instrument side, because it's more of a getting the order and ship it relatively quickly, while instrument businesses tend to carry a little bit longer of a backlog. So, in terms of months of visibility, I would say the overall company has less visibility 3, 4, 5 months on the road than Thermo Electron used to have.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "I asked what to emerging markets there is big sort of fissure out of the coupling of growth in that even if there is a U.S. slow down particularly they won't be effects in China and some of the other markets. I mean have you seen anything that is giving you an indication that the Chinese market is slowing to any degree, changing its growth trajectory? And then on top of that how do you anticipate demand in the different markets as we head into the Olympics, this summer?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we have not seen any slowdown in places like China and India. Actually the numbers were terrific in both countries. I believe that there is a little difference. China is more heavily weighted typically towards the infrastructure build up, more of a demand to... for building commodity materials, particularly high end demand, environmental demand is high there, but also more and more academic and life sciences type of demand. India is very life sciences and healthcare focused, a lot of CRO's are building laboratories in India and more and more clinical trials are going to done in India. So, I would say that the China is more infrastructure build up first and then second life sciences, and India is really heavily on life sciences in terms of growth. And I can see that growth very easily continuing because, quite honestly, some of the growth that the China and India are experiencing are this transition growth from the U.S. to those countries. If we don't do a clinical trial here anymore, but do it in India, the clinical trials still gets done. The U.S. may decelerate in growth but India fix it up and there are a lot of examples of that both in pharma companies putting up labs in China or India and also on the industrial side. So it's not necessarily true that decelerated growth in the U.S. will come with decelerated growth in Asia in my opinion.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai from Robert Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Hi, good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter, nice year.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "As you commented that you don't see any change in life sciences, could you kind of decouple, your consumables and instrument business because during this earnings season, we've heard some instrument manufacturers talk about some large pharma companies have had some lumpy cycles especially with the year-end spend, kind of, what did you see in Q4 for your business and then what are your expectations in '08?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well we didn't really see any sort of significant shifts Quintin, and very similar patterns to the third quarter and second quarter and year-over-year on the pharma side. So I cannot really second to comments that perhaps were made by some of our peers.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "And in 2008 the trend of pharma taking some things out to CROs how do you see that impacting your business?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well actually there is positive, because when ever a pharma company decides not to do an experiment in the lab anymore and outsource it to a CRO, the CRO now has to set themselves up to do that experiment and invariably that leads to an accelerated turn over of equipments. It's an accelerated replacement cycle. So I actually think that some of strengths in the life sciences market is the result of this outsourcing of pharma to CROs.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "And my second question here, Pete in 2007, could you give us an idea of what the impact of divestitures were on growth and then, in your 2008 expectations, how much is divestitures from 2007 affecting '08? And then also as a follow up to that anything that we need to watch out for Easter falling Q1 for Q1 modeling purposes?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay a lot of question... So 2007 divestures was pretty minimal impact on our top line it was very limited we had a couple of joint ventures that moved out of our fully consolidated reporting and into a joint venture income recording but it was fairly insignificant, I missed the middle question.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Fine. In 2008, any expectations... any divestitures that occurred in '07 that would be impacted in to '08?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, again there's very minimal impact. There is... those joint ventures went out at about the middle of the year, but there's less than 1% impact to the year-over-year reported growth. Obviously, we would exclude those from any kind of organic comparison.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "And then, with respect to Easter because now... because any difference [ph] in your business is consumables now?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Certainly in Q1 this year, the way our calendar works out, Q1 is going to be a little bit lighter on a year-over-year comparison basis because of the way the Easter holiday falls. It won't effect the full year but we will see an impact... negative impact in Q1 and then we will get it back basically in Q4 as the way that the days will fall out. And that is a significant impact compared to kind of the old Thermo where we had the capital and equipment business now as we're in to 50% consumables. That does have an impact on the year-over-year growth.", "Quintin Lai - Baird", "Thank you.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson from Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Marijn, you talked about the strength in the environmental business. How big is that business for you and how fast its growing and where do you see that growth?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we have sort of two sets of environmental businesses. One that is serving environmental laboratory and so instrumentation and consumables and software that ends up in a laboratory setting with full water quality or other types of environmental studies. And then another part and this is the fastest growing part is the part where we have air quality monitoring in the real world. So instrumentation that is attached to smokestack and is monitoring all of the gases and other stuff that comes out, in particular Mercury that comes out of the smokestack.", "And that particular part of environmental instruments is growing extremely fast. I think our overall exposure to environmental is probably 7% to 8% of our revenue, so $700 million to $800 million. But this particular part of environmental monitoring on smokestacks is growing very rapidly, driven by some very good new products that we introduced to address new legislation in the United States, particularly around the monitoring of Mercury emission.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And then moving on to the diagnostic business; last quarter you seemed to be very excited about the idea of convergence between the diagnostics and life science industry. How fast is that business growing for you and where will you see any growth?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well in general, we have a specialty diagnostic capability that is about $1 billion or so in revenue and the growth there is particularly in two areas, I'd say, one of them is in anatomical pathology where we have seen very, very nice organic growth number in 2007. So this is anatomical pathology similar to businesses like Santana [ph] in the same space that is being acquired by Roche. And the other area is microbiology, and microbiology is basically detecting bacterial infections or bacterial contamination, both from a life sciences point of view and from a food chain point of view and needless to say with everything that's going on in terms of bacterial infection and hospital. What's going on the food supply that business has seen very nice growth as well.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you and then just finally Peter, could you explain the lower tax rate in the quarter, looks moderately low and looks like there's some seasonal element to that tax rate. Where does that come from and is that expected next year as well?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No there is no seasonal element to it. Basically at the end of Q3, we had a full year forecast of 24.6%. At the end of the year, we ended at 24%. So that 0.6% has to get adjusted in the current quarter. So it's simply going from a ... reducing our full year estimate by 0.6% and that was driven by additional usage of foreign tax credits as well as a shift in our income to some lower tax jurisdictions in our international businesses.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "What's the guidance for '08 for tax?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "24%.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay, thank you so much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Butler from Lehman Brothers.", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Marijn and a couple of questions. Number one is when you think the analytical instrument business, can you perhaps dive a little deeper into the notion of what seems to be selling best now. Is it mass spec, is it areas of equipment and elemental analysis, is it molecular spectroscopy and is there really any shift among the analytical instrument sub-segments that seems to meriting greater demand. And then second question really evolves around your Asia rest of world business. Well assume it's roughly 10% of the total globe, is it growing such that you could see it being 12% or 13% at the end of 08? Is that how one should think about it or is it still relatively smaller in the grand scheme of the total business? Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Hi Tony. So on the analytical instruments, what are we seeing? We are participating in a number of areas, of course mass spec is a very big area for us and that is growing gangbusters mass spectrometry is very much driven by the slew of new product technologies that we have been bringing out over the last few years and I would particularly highlight the Orbitrap technologies there.", "And then your question about other areas like elemental and molecular spectroscopy. Another very strong area is elemental analysis and that goes really back to an industrial, more industrial customers base and that has a need for quality control with elemental analysis in the lab. And that is a very, very strong area for us right now in 07 and it looks to be, as I mentioned no slowdown at this point for 08. Molecular spectroscopy is a little bit more in the middle, and sort... can go both ways, more life sciences and more sort of an industrial and it is growing less fast than mass spectrometry and elemental at this point. So does that answer your question?", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Yes, it does and it's very helpful. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's okay. And then Asia, yes, we are obviously growing faster in Asia, particularly China and India than the overall average of the company, but you know when you see 12% to 15% on $1 billion then we got to come up with $200 million to $300 million of extra sales over there, in the year and that's sounds a little aggressive. So I do believe, I haven't done the math but we are around 11% now in Asia and that probably increase by 5% or so in 08, just because we up more share there in the faster growing parts of the world. But there would in $100 million extra, so that grow than a 10% vis-\u00e0-vis the company and in the mid-single digit. So, I think that that will pick up about you know a percent a year in Asia extra over the next few years. Unless we do acquisitions there of course and then it would be accelerated.", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Very helpful Marijn. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you, Tony.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from J.P. Morgan.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi this is Sun Gi [ph] in for Tycho Peterson today. Just building on the previous question, question about the mass spec business, some of your competitors have mentioned. I'm seeing increasing competition in the lower end of the market, particularly in terms of increasing price pressure... pricing pressures. Could you comment on kind Thermo's I guess competitive position, I know you are saying that it's going gangbusters where what the target markets are as far as your outlook for 2008 in this space?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Marc if you want you can.", "Marc N. Casper - Executive Vice President", "In terms of mass spec, its Marc Casper speaking, we had good success across our range of products. The hydro products, the Orbitrap obviously continues to be very strong. But we've seen a very significant growth in our triple-quad product line as well and that's given us good strength, both at the higher and lower price points. We have also seen, good momentum, geographically North America, Asia and Europe, all having good growth. So while mass spec is certainly a very competitive market, our reputation as the... certainly the technology innovation leader and continuing to bring up solid new products has certainly positioned us very well in the mass spectrometry market.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. And as per your 2008 revenue guidance, could you comment on kind of your underlying assumptions for the acquisition impact and that acquisition impacting 2007 and as well as what are your current assumptions are for the currency exchange rate?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes the impact of acquisitions is a little bit more than 1% and the foreign exchange impacted about 1.5% at current rates.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood from Banc of America Securities.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Hey, thanks a lot. Did you provide operating cash flow guidance for '08, I might have missed that, I am sorry.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, I didn't provide a number of operating cash flow guidance.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Can you do it?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Can I, or will I?", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Will you?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, we had a very strong year in 2007. As I said we generated $1.34 billion of operating cash flow. Honestly, I think in 2008, that will be a tough number to match, so I would say we're probably looking at a number of around $1.2 billion, is what my expectation is that may get better as we go through the year, but that that's where I start at.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Okay and then CapEx, is it grow any in 2008?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah CapEx is actually going to go up a little bit in 2008. We had about 100 and little more of a $150 million in 2007. I expect that number to be more like $250 million in 2008.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Okay. Great thanks. And then can you give us an update into the integration or consolidation opportunities in the Fisher legacy manufacturing businesses, the Apogens, the Pro-Bios. Just wondering, if you have encountered or discovered any more opportunity versus your initial look into those businesses, a year ago or so, Is there a potential for a little bit deeper if I could going forward.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "John this Marijn. No there isn't for me. We are on track with the synergies as we mentioned and we really knew the business very well. We've spent the half year between the announcement and the closing back in 2006, very tightly working with the legacy Fisher management, visiting all the sites and doing business reviews so overlaying that with the Thermo capabilities we had a very I think assessment on what the synergies were going to be and where they were going to come from and I would say, were within 95% correct on our assumptions. So, it's a lot of work that happening across the company, rationalizing some of these facilities. 2008 will be a key year of doing that. But I wouldn't say there is upside in that.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Okay great. One quick one, if I can sneak one in. The Fisher Healthcare is the healthcare part of your business. Any material change in the outlook there for '08? Thanks", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No.Do you mean the healthcare catalog or in general the diagnostics area?", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Yes. Just the clinical lab part of the business, both manufacturing and distribution.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Catalog. Yes so no I think that we believe that the demands there will continue to be good. It was good in 2007 and we believe that, that will continue to be quite robust and there is no real indications going into this new year that that things in this market will be significantly different.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America", "Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you John.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Good morning.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Good morning Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "During your Analyst Day last May you had talked about 2009 and operating margin targets somewhere in the 19% to 20% range. Two questions; are you still comfortable with that and I guess can you just give us a color on what the mix is in terms of margin expansion, gross margin expansion and operating costs. I guess just what's going into driving that. I get a lot of these questions from clients, just trying to factor out what's going in?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "That's makes it a very good question. So Derik, if you look over 2007, our EBITDA in margin is closed to 70%. So our goal is to expand on our operating margins by 100 basis points a year on average and we believe that we can do that in the next number of years. So that's 19% to 20% that we're talking about for 09, is certainly within reach.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "It doesn't help to come off a 200 basis points here obviously in 2007 and I forgot your next the second question.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Just the contributions for my guess your EBITDA gains, gross margins expansion.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "So I think typically we sort of think about top line growth adding about half of our own margin expansion and the other half coming from key productivity activity. That includes PPI sourcing from restructuring. So, it's sort of a 50-50 balance of increased profitability.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "The safety business has been a drag for a while. I guess you know, is it on short list and could you potentially divest it?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are not going to divest it. There's two phases to the safety business, one is the core business which is actually doing quit well and this is providing safety supplies to laboratories, in particular people work who in laboratories and want to protect themselves. So that's very much in line with our overall research market catalog and completely integrated from a supply chain point of view. So there's no we could divest it. The other piece of it is a piece that is specifically focused on the fire and preparedness market, so this is everything that has do with Homeland Security, first responders equipping themselves with safety devices in case there is a calamity happening. And that is the part that is really rapidly decreasing in size.", "Obviously it peaked, few years after 9/11 and then in last few years it has come down significantly and though it's not really that bigger part of that over all business, may be only 25%. The decline there is so significant that it drags down that whole division. But it is a market that we are serving we are serving it with the same capability and infrastructure as we are serving the lab market. So you cannot slice that out and say lets divest it is what it is. It's a very, very up and down business and the demand for that business I hope it doesn't happen but demand for that business could spike again if there would be some type of terrorist event unanticipated in the U.S. So it is what it is we are living through it. I think the year-over- year comparisons are getting easier on it. Of course I said that last year as well and I was wrong last year, but we believe it should to be true this year.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay that's very helpful. I guess with that business if I recall from the... just recall it was that more of the fact that appropriate funds were never spent or just completed less investment in overall preparing to see this.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think in general there was such a spike in investments, and then when the Iraq war started to cost more and more money I think that was a sought a reduced ability to spend truly on Homeland Security which is really here in the Homeland.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "IGHT", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "And I saw that the budget proposals, again which has spiked for Homeland Security. So may be there will be a re-equilibration. But who knows what's going to happen with new politics in Washington pretty soon. I am not really, it's an integral parts of the business. It has it's ups and downs, we'll take it the way it comes.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "I am showing no further questions at this time.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I just want to say a few things in closing. I think you've heard from our enthusiasm that we are very happy with how 2007 finished up for us. We continue our track record of strong financial performance and we've successfully integrated what was really a major acquisition that we believe is transforming our industry. And we are defining what it means to be a leader in this space. And with our unique position, we think we're able to capitalize on the opportunities that we have, so very focused on creating value for our customers, our shareholders and our employees.", "So thank you very much for all of your support of Thermo Fisher and we are looking forward to updating you on the first quarter of '08 in three months.

Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning and thank you for joining us.

Related information is also available in the Investors section of the website under the heading Webcasts & Presentations.", "With that, I would like to now turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us for our review of the first quarter of 2008. I'm very pleased to report that we are off to a good start for the year. We had strong financial performance in the quarter and a lot of exciting developments that will contribute to our growth going forward. So, let me give you an overview of our results, some comments on what we're seeing in our markets, and talk about a number of recent business highlights.", "First, the financial highlights. Since we completed our first full year at Thermo Fisher Scientific in 2007, our results can now be compared on an apples-to-apples basis, no more need for pro forma comparison. Our Q1 revenues grew 9% to a record $2.6 billion. Adjusted EPS rose 25%, adjusted operating income increased 19%, and we continued our trend of significant adjusted operating margin expansion with 140 basis points of improvement. So, we believe we delivered a strong quarter even though we lost between 1% and 2% of our revenue growth year-to-year because we had fewer days in the first quarter of 2008.", "We are very pleased with the way our financial business model is working. From our top line growth, we are able to pull through significant earnings growth and margin expansion. In addition, our focus on operating discipline and continued productivity, as well as synergies from acquisitions further strengthens our profit margins. An important part of our business model and I want to emphasize this, as I did last quarter, is that we run the company by striking a balance between our four key financial metrics; top line growth, operating margins, EPS, and free cash flow. We believe that this balanced approach is the best way to create shareholder value over the long term.", "So, moving on to the markets. Let me say a few words on what we are seeing at this point in the year. Our major life sciences and healthcare end markets remained strong and overall, we have not experienced any change from what we\u2019ve seen over the past few quarters. The safety market, however, continues to be very weak, specifically the Domestic Preparedness segment, which led to poor results in that part of our catalog business. We also saw some softening of demand in certain industrial markets late in the quarter, specifically oil and gas and semiconductor, which are both relatively small markets for us.", "So, apart from some weakness in the smaller markets, in general, we haven't seen any significant change. I'm confident that our balanced mix of markets, global presence, products and services will limit our exposure to certain economic headwinds that we're hearing a lot about. This along with our proven operating discipline puts us in a strong position to deliver on our financial goals for 2008. So, a few words on new developments. Another advantage for us is that we have the resources to continue to build on our product portfolio and global presence to fortify our position as the world leader in serving science. We've had a number of exciting developments in the past few months that I want to spend a few minutes on.", "We had an excellent showing of new products at Pittcon and Analytica, and let me mention some of the highlights under our Thermo Scientific brand. One, we completely redesigned our Raman and FT-IR spectroscopy platforms to make these technologies available to the non-expert. These advanced techniques, which in the past were limited to specialists in lab, can now be used by just about any operator. For example, technicians in a busy forensic lab.", "Secondly in mass spectrometry, we launched new enhancements for our highly successful Orbitrap platform, adding MALDI and ETD capabilities for ever higher levels of sensitivity and mass accuracy. The Orbitrap with ETD allows scientists to significantly increase the number of proteins they can identify without increasing the experiment time. The Orbitrap with MALDI is especially suited to the imaging of whole tissue samples to precisely understand, for instance, how new drugs may affect the brain and other organs.", "We also introduced a new atomic absorption spectrometer called the iCE 3000 Series. This new AA system is designed specifically for highly regulated laboratory environments such as food safety, environmental, pharma, and metals and materials applications. I have to say that between both of these conferences we have the strongest new product lineup ever in our history, which demonstrates our ongoing commitment to technology innovation. Our product development and marketing teams did a superb job to pull this up, and I am confident this will pay dividends in the future.", "There is a lot of innovation going on in our life sciences, consumables businesses as well and we had two great examples in the past few months. First, we introduced a breakthrough in RNAi technology that greatly simplifies the method for gene silencing during drug discovery. Our new Accell platform makes it possible for researchers to deliver siRNA directly into cells without using the delivery reagents, which can affect the results of their experiments. Because this can be applied to many types of cells, it opens the door for significant new biomedical and pharmaceutical research. And then in our microbiology business, we received FDA clearance for a new MRSA test called Spectra that can screen patients for staph infection when they are admitted to the hospital. Our test is highly accurate, provides results in 24 hours, is easy to administer and is very cost effective. This means that more medical facilities will use it and more patients will be protected from this life-threatening infection, which is often called the superbug.", "And then finally, we introduced our first Fisher Scientific catalog in Chinese, targeted specifically to the growing demands of customers in research, testing, and processing facilities in that country. This is a great opportunity for us to leverage our strong Fisher Scientific brand to establish a strong customer channel in China.", "We continue to see double-digit growth in Asian markets and are investing heavily to expand our presence there, primarily in China and India. The Chinese catalog is one example. Our acquisition of Qualigens Fine Chemicals last year is another example, making us the leading laboratory chemical supplier in India. In addition, construction of our new clinical packaging facility is underway and should begin shipping supplies this fall.", "So, final words on guidance before I hand it over to Pete. To wrap up here, we feel very good about our prospects for overall growth and fully expect to deliver on our financial goals for 2008. Last quarter, we said we expected to report revenue growth of 8% to 9% over 2007 and we now expect our revenues to be in the range of $10.6 billion to $10.7 billion for 9% to 10% growth. This is primarily the result of more favorable currency translation.", "Our increased revenue estimate also leads us to raise our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02. We now expect to report a range of $3.07 to $3.17 for 2008, which is a 16% to 20% increase over 2007.", "So with that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Pete Wilver for his financial review. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marijn. Good morning everyone. During the first quarter of 2008, we realigned our product portfolio to transfer a few small businesses representing approximately $70 million in annual revenue from the Analytical Technologies segment to our Laboratory Products and Services segment. The 2007 data in our earnings release and in my comments today has been restated to reflect those changes. And since we completed our first full year as Thermo Fisher Scientific last quarter, we no longer have to talk about pro forma comparisons to the prior year. As Marijn said, we had another strong quarter with 25% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.74 compared to $0.59 in Q1 last year. GAAP earnings per share in Q1 were $0.53, up from $0.31 from the prior year\u2019s quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating performance and lower merger-related charges, partially offset by higher acquisition intangibles amortization.", "Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS. Revenues in Q1 increased 9% year-over-year to $2.55 billion. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 4%, excluding favorable currency translation of 4% and acquisitions net of divestitures of 1%. Organic revenue growth in the quarter, particularly in our consumables businesses, was negatively impacted by two days or between 1% and 2% as a result of a shift in the Easter holiday from Q2 and having one less day in the fiscal quarter as compared to Q1 2007.", "Bookings slightly exceeded revenues in the quarter by about 0.5%. In the Analytical Technologies segment, Q1 revenues rose 10% on a reported basis and 4% organically. In the quarter, we saw good organic growth in our life sciences and healthcare markets. However, a few of our smaller industrial markets showed some softness later in the quarter. Our new product introductions continue to be a growth driver, specifically in our mass spectrometry and environmental product lines.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 4.5% organically. During the quarter, our research and healthcare catalogs and our biopharma outsourcing services business all exhibited strong growth. This was partially offset by continued top line weakness in our safety catalog business, which negatively impacted total company organic growth by approximately 1%.", "By geography, we saw organic growth across all our major regions with the exception of Europe, which was essentially flat against particularly strong growth in the year-ago quarter. North America grew at slightly below the company average and Asia-Pacific grew in the high-teens. The rest of the world grew at close to 30% albeit from a very small base. Q1 adjusted operating income increased 19% year-over-year to $447 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 140 basis points from 16.1% in the year-ago quarter. The margin expansion was driven by pull-through on our incremental organic revenues, including increased prices, our integration sourcing and productivity initiatives, and slightly lower stock compensation expense.", "Analytical Technologies\u2019 Q1 adjusted operating income increased by 23% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 21%, up 220 basis points versus 18.8% last year. Laboratory Products and Services\u2019 Q1 adjusted operating income increased by 15% and adjusted operating margin increased by 60 basis points to 13.9% as compared to 13.3% in the prior year.", "Adjusted gross margin was 41.1% in Q1, up 66 basis points from 40.5% in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of price increases net of inflation, volume leverage, and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives. We are continuing to see increased inflationary pressure on our raw material costs, primarily in steel, copper, and plastics. Adjusted SG&A was 21.2% of revenue in Q1, down 66 basis points from 21.9% in the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and integration synergies. R&D expense was 2.4% of revenue in Q1, down 13 basis points from the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage.", "Moving to below the line items, adjusted net interest expense was $20 million in Q1, down $8 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of reductions in our debt and increased cash. Other income was a loss of $1.5 million, down $3 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of currency translation losses on foreign entity cash.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24.3%, in line with our full-year 2007 actual and 2008 forecast rate of 24%. The Q1 2008 adjusted tax rate was down 0.7% from the prior year, primarily as a result of the tax planning we implemented during 2007. Average diluted shares were 436 million for the quarter, down 5 million from last year and 4 million from the prior quarter, reflecting the benefit of the share buyback program we initiated in Q3 2007.", "During the quarter, we used $102 million to repurchase 1.8 million shares, which completes our outstanding $1 billion share buyback authorization, which resulted in a total repurchase of 18.2 million shares. In terms of balance sheet performance, we ended the quarter with $748 million in cash and investments, up $109 million from Q4, as our free cash flow was partially offset by share repurchases.", "Our debt was essentially flat with the prior quarter at $2.2 billion. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 56 days, up one day from the prior year. Excluding the quarter-end versus average impact of foreign currency translation, which ramped up significantly towards the end of the quarter, DSO was flat with the prior year. Inventory days of supply was 75 days, down one day from the prior year. Excluding the impact of average versus ending foreign currency translation, inventory days of supply improved by two days versus the prior year.", "Finally, Q1 cash flow from continuing operations was $243 million and after deducting net capital expenditures of $53 million, free cash flow from continuing ops was $190 million.", "Moving on to our 2008 guidance, we are increasing our full-year reported revenue guidance by $100 million to a range of $10.6 billion to $10.7 billion, primarily as a result of favorable foreign currency translation. This range represents 9% to 10% growth versus our 2007 actual revenue of $9.75 billion. We are also increasing our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02 to a range of $3.07 to $3.17, as a result of the higher revenues, which represent 16% to 20% growth versus the $2.65 we reported in 2007.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We are open for questions.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Jonathan Groberg with Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, please.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, thanks for taking the call. Congratulations on a good quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Jonathan.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "I just had a couple of questions, the first one relating to Pete's comments about commodities and we continue to see all of these prices go up at fairly rapid levels. So, I am wondering what's kind of the lag between when you are seeing that commodity price inflation show up in your manufactured products and your ability to pass on the prices to your customers?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, it impacts us mostly in the areas where we are fairly vertically integrated. So, we are actually buying the raw material and bending and painting steel and things like that. We see that impact relatively quickly in those areas and that we started to see it in the second half of last year and in Q1, it ramped up a little bit. We see it probably with a higher lag, where we are buying subassemblies and components that have those materials in them because our suppliers have a harder time passing those costs on to us. So, it's somewhat of a mix, but I would say, we are seeing the impact pretty heavily right now. I don't think there is another lag that we\u2019ll see, a bigger impact going into Q2 or Q3, if that's your question.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And do you think... are you able to pass that pricing on or are your prices\u2026 for these types of items, is that an ongoing negotiation or do you have list prices that are going to last kind of throughout the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's difficult to pass those costs on directly on those types of products. Certainly, our competitors are seeing the same thing that we are in those areas. So, if this continues on, certainly the market price should go up on those products, but in the near term it's hard to pass those cost increases on directly to customers.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "But what you\u2019ve seen in the last little bit, you are still comfortable with your kind of margin expectations for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Certainly. Even though we saw pretty significant material cost and inflation, if you look at our net sourcing savings we\u2019re still positive. So, we're saving more money on material than the inflation is costing us.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. And then, Marijn, can you address\u2026 there has been a lot of talk around the hospital-acquired infections and [inaudible] much about some of your diagnostic capabilities. But can you maybe address in a little more detail why you think that your MRSA solution is going to be well received by hospitals relative to some of the molecular tests that may be a bit more rapid out there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yes. It's just a price difference, our test cost about $3 and these rapid tests cost $30. And in some European countries, where this screening has started a number of years ago, that the number of infections, patients that get infected with the superbug in a hospital has not basically dwindled down to negligible levels. So, I mean it's very obvious that the screening upfront of patients coming into the hospital is the right thing to do to avoid these infections. But it's been incredibly expensive and we are now coming out with something that only cost $3, 10 times less than what\u2019s typically used on what is a more rapid test. So, we think there will be great reception for that price difference in the market and it will allow more hospitals this time screening it, even though it takes a day rather than just a few hours.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And what was the... I'm sorry the time difference previously, so this one I think is about 24 hours on your new test, I think, and in your press release you said and what was it previously?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it has to do more with accuracy. So, you really get now a definitive result. I mean I think the previous tests were\u2026 similar tests were also 24 hours, but much less definitive and you would have to do a follow-on test if you saw certain results, so that would make it take another 24 hours.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, now after 24 hours you have the definitive answer.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great, thanks a lot and congratulations.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Jonathan.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin with UBS. Go ahead, please.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Good morning.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "So, I've been getting a few questions about the product testing inspection market and some of the growth opportunities there, specifically it's like that... are these markets potentially more cyclical than some people expect given that the economies are under pressure? And also the fact is you\u2019ve got the Beijing Olympics coming out and there is some concern that China might pull back in terms of the spending as it's happening? Just talk about how you see the product inspection and safety market, food safety market, something like that just expanding and... just a little bit in terms of what you see in the past through economic cycles in those markets?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Derik, it\u2019s a very difficult question, actually a good question, a very difficult one, because I do not think that in the previous economic downturn cycle in 2001-2002 we were importing as much food and related items from China as a western world as we are today. So, the way I view it is, it's very hard to predict with absolute certainty how strong these markets will be by quarter. But I do believe that the world has gotten increasingly nervous about what's going on in terms of food quality inspections like we are just talking about, lead and paint, which was another, big to do a few quarters ago. And that the world is much more alert of what is safe, what's healthy, what's clean than even eight years ago. And I think it has a lot to do with the fact that the world has become a lot more global. There is much more easy transfer of products and goods across the world, including things that we put in our bodies. So, with that I think the need for compliance with western quality control systems for anybody who wants to import into the western country is going to be more and more relevant. And as you know, China and India are developing their economies, they will have to beef up their capabilities to meet these western standards. So, I don't think that's going to go away in an economic cycle necessarily if they want to continue to export.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay, that's great. And I just want to kind of stick on the safety thing for a minute and go to the catalog safety business.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "That's been... I mean that dog hasn't hunted since like Fisher had it back in 2005 and I'm just wondering when you are going to pull the plug on there? What's your expectations there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, we don't... we won't pull the plug on it. And let me just explain what the situation is. We basically have a number of Fisher catalogs and you could say we have a research catalog, we have a healthcare catalog, and we have a safety catalog. And the safety catalog is by far the smallest one, has about $350 million of revenue, but it's completely integrated with the other catalogs. So, it's being served out of the same warehouses, the same back office, the same basic infrastructure that supports it. So, it's very... it's basically impossible to break it up, okay, if we would want to. And so what has happened is that the base business of that safety catalog is doing fine, it basically mostly serves laboratories or some industrial environments with safety gear. And it's doing fine just like the overall research catalog is doing well. That part that isn't doing well is anything that has to do with preparedness for terrorist attacks or fire or anything Homeland Security related, Army, things like that because the government is really not spending a lot of money right now here in the US on domestic preparedness and all the money is spent obviously overseas, okay.", "Now, we had a huge ramp up in spending in that area into 2002, 2003, 2004 time frames, very good times and now it's coming down and it's coming down very, very significantly. So, it's a small part of the business, but it's coming down a lot. But my point is, at some point it will level off to maybe next to nothing, but it will level off and that's not far away by the way, that time frame. And it's all supported through the same back office structure any way, so that there is no ability for us to carve it out or do something creative with it divested. It just\u2026 it is what it is.", "And on the other hand, I hate to say this, but we're only one terrorist attack away from that business booming again, okay. So, it is serving a need, the business is there. We are capable of serving the customers when they need it, they just don't need the products right now. And it makes for a tough year-over-year comparison because as Peter said, it cost us 1% organic growth for the whole company. But it is what it is, and over time over as some quarters go by here in 2008, we will... we will see less decline, because it just cannot decline much further, quite honestly.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Thanks for the color. But unfortunately, it doesn't make me feel any safer.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no, I can see that. And that was not the context of my comments.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The only point Derik is, that dog actually did hunt Q1 last year, that business actually showed growth last year. So, it was a really tough comparison, the comparisons, as Marijn said, get easier as we get through the year.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Thanks.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tony Butler with Lehman Brothers. Go ahead, please.", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "Thank you very much. A couple of questions, Pete. You made a reference to some of the small industrial market\u2026 end markets having slowed and then just like for you to explore exactly what those may be from a Thermo perspective? And then Marijn, last quarter you made reference to having pretty good visibility on at least six months out, maybe even a little longer on your overall business and now that we are at quarter end, can you make some more qualitative comments as it relates to your vision? Thanks, again.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Tony, the second question is also related to the industrial markets, I assume, the six months out?", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "That is correct.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. So, what we say, I'll take both questions because they are connected. We've seen, as I said in my prepared comments, particularly towards the end of the quarter some softness in some markets and they are relatively small markets for us. But semiconductor, basically anything that has to do with semiconductor equipment. Semiconductor production is very weak and also oil and gas was weak as an end market in terms of demand at the end of the quarter. Again, a small markets for us, but that's what we did see. The other markets have continued the way they are, basically still stimulated by high commodity pricing, that lets people to want to continue to invest in expansion of that capacity. And the comments I\u2019ve made in the past about our visibility in that is actually not that we have specific visibility, but we do have a relatively significant backlog typically in process-oriented applications. So, if people are going to be building a new mine or a new steel plant and commodity prices drop in the middle of that project, they are not going to just let it sit there half finished, they will finish it off. So, we then have an opportunity, even though commodity prices would have come down significantly, to deliver those orders, that iron backlog, and that's why there isn't an immediate effect from process instruments typically onto our revenue in a specific quarter. Does that make sense?", "Tony Butler - Lehman Brothers", "It does, Marijn. Thank you very much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Tony.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead, please.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Hi, good morning gentlemen.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Ross.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank Securities", "I think the commentary on new product introductions is certainly encouraging. You guys have done a phenomenal job of this over the last few years. Are we getting to a point where it's going to be harder and harder to sort of move that metric that you guys track in terms of new product introductions comprising a certain percentage of current sales. Are we sort of hitting diminishing returns there? Is there still a lot of leg way to go? And then is that part of the reason gross margins exceeded and came in at such a high level for the quarter because typically you obviously get good pricing on sort of your new product introductions?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "There is no end to our capability to come out with better and new products. There is no saturation there. I mean you have to work hard on it, but [inaudible] the same thing as saying that the first Apple Computer was the best it could ever be, there really is no end to innovation. And if you think about what our customers are trying to do in the laboratory, the complexity in terms of life science and how many questions are still unanswered in life sciences and healthcare. Then the complexity of precisely measuring things like the superbug and lead in toys that are already on the store of... in the store of toy manufacturers. I really don't see an end to the need for better new products and I don't see an end to our capability to deliver them. So, that process will be ongoing. There is a trend here that I think our customers want the products to be easier to use. It\u2019s harder and harder for them to hire first-class scientists or chemists or biologists to do to work in the laboratory, that has become more complicated. So, there is a lot of focus on not just how good of a quality experiment can you do, but how easy is it to do the experiments and that leads to a whole different set of innovation that are also fueling our future growth. And then you are right, I mean typically when we come out with a new product, we do sell it at higher margins than older products and it helps us drive our margin improvement. It has done that over the years and I believe it will continue to do so.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And as we look at sort of the big pharma group as a customer, could you sort of compare contrast what you saw during the quarter in terms of their spending habits relative to sort of Analytical Tools versus Lab Products. Was there any sort of difference at buying pattern, especially sort of on the higher end of instrumentation of consumables and was there... the demand pattern sort of relatively stable throughout the quarter or did we\u2026 sort of weak start and then maybe a stronger close to the quarter?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, it's a complicated question, but essentially we did well with large pharma in the first quarter as a company. And I think it has a lot to do with our specific focus at the corporate account level of tailoring to the needs of large pharma in particular because the strategy we\u2019ve talked about in the past is, large customers are buying inefficiently and we are trying to help them buy more efficiently and that leads to some share gains for us. So, we did well with large pharma, at the same time I think some of our peers have said that in Europe, in particular, it was a slow quarter for higher-cost items in large pharma and we saw the same thing. So, we did see the same behavior in larger European pharma company of delaying... hopefully delaying orders.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And I just want to sort of follow-up one quick thing to that. So, when you announced the Fisher deal, one of the longer-term stories on the revenue synergy line was obviously sort of the ability to continue to drive more share within the big pharma customer base and really focusing on sort of the top-20 accounts and being able to capture a bigger piece of that pie. Given your commentary around what you saw in first quarter, do you feel one year into the deal that you're finally starting to get some momentum relative to that effort and\u2026 or maybe not sizeable amounts of revenue moving the needle really, but sort of to the point where you feel like that sort of initial thought is finally starting to manifest itself in your P&L?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean it is and it\u2019s different for every different pharma, you cannot generalize. The pickup on that is different by account. Some pharma customers are very, very interested in doing this and are really working with us to drive a level of standardization of laboratory supplies that they haven't had before and others aren't maybe that interested at this particular point in time not because they are not interested in the efficiency that could come from it or the savings, but it's just not yet a priority for them. But as we've talked about before, Ross, we are a strong believer that even big pharma at some point will have to become an efficient buyer of all the goods and services that they buy and we\u2019ll be well positioned to serve them in that context.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "And just actually one sort of quick other follow-up. Relative to your commentary around sort of less selling days and around sort of the movement of the Easter into the March... March quarter, is that also, Pete, part of the reason why Europe was probably a little weaker maybe than sort of expected coming in relatively flat for the quarter despite having also a tough comp from last year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes. Certainly, we don't have any way to [inaudible] prove that, but certainly you would expect the Easter holiday to have a bigger impact on Europe just because they tend to take more of an Easter week rather than one holiday.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Perfect. Thank you very much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "But they\u2019ll make it up some other time.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Great.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from John Sullivan with Leerink Swann. Go ahead, please.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Hi, guys good morning. Can you hear me?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Great. A couple of quick ones. First of all, can you just talk about opportunity that you feel like is still available to you at the facilities level both from the Fisher deal and in your own business. Do you feel like you have significant consolidation opportunities still available to you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. John, good morning. Yes, we do. And that's been part of our cost synergy plan for the first three years after the merger. I think we\u2019ve talked about... about eight factories that we felt that we could close strictly as a result of the merger between Thermo and Fisher. And that's into works. I mean the announcements have been made in most cases and this will be happening over the next day year-and-a-half.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Thanks very much. And then could you talk about the hospital business just a little bit. And specifically I'm just wondering it's around 20% of your revenues. As a distribution channel, do you feel like you have a lot more room to put more products through to the hospital clients and is that a priority for you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I mean the 20% is roughly\u2026 10% of it is\u2026 10%, half of it is our specialty diagnostics capability, which is all self-manufactured and diagnostic testing, anatomical pathology to microbiology, I was talking about things like that. And then the other half is a catalog, customer channel catalog that we have that services the healthcare market and that's the other half of the revenue. And if you ask about our abilities there to put more products through that catalog, certainly we believe we have a very strong franchise there and it has a very good reputation and we are having multiple discussions with suppliers to see if we can broaden the scope of what that catalog offers. So, we do believe we have opportunity there.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "And then just to kind of circle back to the first comment on the hospital business, obviously this MRSA test that was just approved, you already have full distribution capability for that test, right?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "John Sullivan - Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes is from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird. Go ahead, please.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good morning.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "As we are... just to follow-up on Ross' question, but to focus on the consumables side. This earnings season we've seen some pretty decent numbers on the pure play consumables companies. Then they also mentioned price increase, could you kind of decouple the maybe softness in European large pharma with respect to overall consumables and price?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Let me think about it. I mean the consumables business has a number of expectations [ph], high ends, life sciences, reagents and then you have the more routine consumables that are being used in laboratories. And I think your question must be related to high ends, life sciences, reagents if you compare it with some of the peers, right?", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Yes, that's right.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. So, I think that business is doing quite well, in general. But it depends very much... it's very application dependent, for instance anything that has to do with cell research is doing very well, cell science. Anything that has to do with RNAi is doing very well. Things that have to do with novel DNA sequencing doing well. But there are also other applications that are not growing so fast and they tend to be the more mature applications. So, it's hard to generalize because they are really... it's almost like... almost like what\u2019s in fashion on the consumables side in terms of growth. And you see, I think, more than an instrument a relatively big swing over a number of years of where people are spending the money. And it has, I think, a lot to do with scientists who don't work in cell biology or don't work in RNAi, for instance, deciding the best scenario they want to get into and really become new customers for consumables in that field.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you for that. And then, Pete, with respect to cash flow guidance, forgive me, did you give... provide an update on that and could you give us a little bit more color on potential for a new authorization for share repurchase or future M&A?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I didn't provide updated guidance on the free cash flow. Last quarter, I had said something in the range of $1.2 billion. We had good cash flow in Q1, but nothing that would kind of indicate to me that we ought to go to change that number at this point. So, I stick with something in the range of $1.2 billion for the year and we\u2019ll assess it again at the end of Q2. In terms of the share buyback, we really don't talk about future plans on share buyback authorizations. Obviously, that's a Board decision. But, certainly with $750 million of cash on the balance sheet, certainly we have a strong M&A pipeline and our goal was always to use our cash on our balance sheet to create value for shareholders. So, I don't think you'll see that cash sitting around for a long time.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel. Go ahead, please.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Pete, what was the driver in gross margins in the quarter? What was the\u2026 I wonder if you could quantify, was it\u2026 was there pricing or volume or savings?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It splits about a third, a third, a third, between the pull-through on incremental organic, including price increases, integration synergies, and then the net of sourcing savings offset by inflation, and all of the productivity initiatives that we embark on with our PPI program.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And do you feel all three chunks sustainable for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Certainly, yes.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And then Marijn on the oil and gas weakness, is that continuing into the second quarter, and is that mostly associated with high ASP weaknesses or is it across the board?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I don\u2019t know. I honestly don't know. It's too early to tell, to see whether or not that is systemic or not. It is a little bit of the surprise to me quite honestly because I wouldn't say that the oil and gas companies are really suffering right now, but maybe there is a level of saturation that they have reached in terms of their need for new instrumentation, this is process instrumentation particularly flow meter. So, that\u2019s too early to tell, Peter, too early to tell.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. So, it wasn't just on high ASP equipment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, no. Actually to the contrary, it was more on some basic relatively routine instrumentation.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Right, okay. And then sorry, Peter, the amount of reclassification from the Analytical business, how much was that or what were the pro forma numbers?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's about $70 million that moved on an annual basis from Analytical over to Laboratory Products and Services. And those numbers are in our analyst package that's out on the website.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Wood with Banc of America Securities. Go ahead, please.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Thanks. Marijn, has the acquisition pipeline changed at all thus far in '08? Are you seeing more properties available and have valuation expectations changed at all?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Maybe yes, slightly more available. I would say valuation expectations have not really changed, but obviously private equity is much less in the mix as it used to be as a potential competitor for those properties. So, valuation expectations may not have changed, but for smaller private companies the fact that there is really not a lot of private equity interference any more may help prices to be more reasonable.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Has the size of the opportunities changed at all?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean most of them typically are between $10 million and $100 million, the tuck-in acquisition, and that's the majority of them and then whether or not a bigger company becomes available is\u2026 I don\u2019t know, that's so hard to predict and the circumstances of that usually are unique company by company.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay, great. On the clinical lab side, if I'm not mistaken you recently picked up the Quest [ph] contract, is that piece of business material and has it started yet?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, it\u2019s good business, it\u2019s material in the sense that any new business we pick up is material to us, but no it's a very good contract and it has already started. Yes.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then one last one on the stock comp. Is that still expected to increase by three pennies this year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, it's probably going to be more like $0.01 for the full year. Q1 was particularly low. You can\u2019t take Q1 and multiply it by four and get the full year. You'll see a ramp up in Q2, Q3, and Q4.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Up to around\u2026 I think it\u2019s around $0.09 for the year.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with J.P. Morgan. Go ahead, please.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Hi, good morning.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "I appreciate the additional color you guys gave on the... kind of the pharma spending trends. I guess the question is given the headlines about pharma in general kind of moving to reduce the global R&D footprint and the fact that you guys typically have pretty good early indicators with the workstations business. I mean are you seeing new lab space being built out or is most of the growth you're seeing coming from higher volumes at existing accounts?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "No. I think the overall laboratory builds as far as we can tell because that's not\u2026 not that easy to track. But as far as we can tell, it's relatively stable compared to 2007. So, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a big change there. I think the piece that a lot of people forget is that or forget or not always think about is that, of course, CROs are doing very well. They are building out lab space because they are basically doing work that before would happen at pharmaceutical companies. So, there is a shift there of work and therefore a shift of tools that come with it. And actually I said it before, that drives in some cases to an accelerated replacement cycle that I think our industry is benefiting from right now.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. In terms of some of the operating initiatives you've laid down in the past, in particular things like PPI. Can you give us a sense as to where we are maybe in the implementation of lower cost sourcing some of these initiatives? They\u2019ve obviously been nice drivers of margin expansion. Where are we in the life cycle\u2019s implementation and then also just in terms of divesting and trimming the portfolio, is that still a focus?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, on PPI and the other operational discipline areas like sourcing, local sourcing, rationalization of factory, that really stems from eight years of experience now on the Thermo side of driving that operational discipline. And we've sort of got them reinvigorated in terms of opportunities with the Fisher merger, because not all of the Fisher businesses have that level of operating discipline. So, we are implementing those principles, particularly PPI, into some of the legacy Fisher businesses. And that gives us a lot of opportunity to improve our processes for the next three years to five years, I would say, because it is not a turn of a switch. This is really an ongoing continuous improvement plan. On the divesting point of view, we are very happy with our portfolio. We'd like to strengthen it, we don't spend a lot of time thinking about divestitures quite honestly. I mean maybe some small loans here or there, but it will be very minor.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then finally, you had talked a while ago about the initiatives in disposable biomanufacturing. Can you give us a sense as to where we are in that business and how you view that opportunity plan out over the next year or two?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "The opportunity is terrific, we believe, because it is done to grow more and more in the bioprocess area to disposable biomanufacturing rather than all these clumsy steel tanks that take forever to clean out. So, we have a very good position in terms of biodisposable reactors and the bags, the containers, things like that. We are actually expanding our capacity in Logan, Utah to serve that demand. So, that's going well. I do believe that overall the bioprocessing industry is in a little bit of a slowdown, which has I believe more to do with some individual issues with certain drugs at some of the biotech companies. But the long-term trend for that, I believe, is very positive.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "And do you see a lot of opportunity for pull-through, I guess, from that business maybe as you get specked [ph] into the process earlier on?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Because, it's the serum or the media and then the containers, the bags. I mean there... it\u2019s huge\u2026 these people are looking for an integrated solution when it's available.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Definitely. But it's not a laboratory, right? It\u2019s a... very often... we have a small pilot facility in the lab, but we are not just servicing the small pilot, different scales of the pilot facility, very small and then media. And then you sort of get into production. And this has showed some of the pilot plans are relatively separate from the laboratory environment. Of course, the specifications are done in the laboratory environment, so it's good to have that relationship. But then it sort of moves away from the lab into really an independent pilot plant facility and then real production later.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "So, I guess in terms of your detection capabilities, are there obvious derivative plays here for process monitoring and things like that?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, there are. Yes.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President, Investor Relations", "I think we're out of time for questions. So, we will just wrap it up here. Marijn, do you have any closing comments?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, yes, some really closing comments here. So, thank you again for being on the call and thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. We believe we had a very strong performance this quarter again and are well positioned for the balance of the year. So, thanks and we are looking forward to update you again next quarter.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno,you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, we have Marijn Dekkers, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Marc Casper, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Peter Wilver, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this car is being webcast live and will be archived on our website, thermofisher.com, until August 29th, 2008. To reach the replay of the call on our website, click on investors and webcast and presentation. Please also be aware that a copy of the press release setting forth our second quarter 2008 earnings in future expectations is available in the investor section on our website, under the heading financial results.", "I would like to begin by reading the safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's form 10-Q, for the quarter end March 29th, 2008, under the caption risk factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the investors section of our website under the heading SEA filings.", "While we may like to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change and therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "During the call, we will referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.

Related information is also available on the investor section of our website under the heading webcast and presentation.", "So, with that I would now like to turn the call over to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I know there are number of companies in our space are competing for your attention this morning. So, thank you very much for joining us. I think you will be glad you did because it was a very good quarter. As you saw in our press release, we had another record quarter in Q2 with strong performance in all of our key financial metrics. So, let me get right to the highlights.", "First, we had a really strong revenue growth quarter with a 14% increase to $2.7 billion. Adjusted EPS rose by 22% and our adjusted operating income increased 18%, and we also achieved 60 bases points of adjusted operating margin expansion, so a terrific growth quarter.", "I believe our success is the result of our sound business model. As you've heard me say before, we do not run this company quarter-by-quarter focused on any one single financial goal. Instead, we work to achieve a balance of our four key financial metrics, which are revenues, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. And we believe that this approach is the best way for us to generate growth that is sustainable and creates value for shareholders over the long-term.", "Our performance in Q2 puts us right where we expected to be halfway through the year and this positions us to meet our growth goals for the full year in 2008. Our results year-to-date also show that not only have we achieved our cost energy targets from the merger of Thermo Fisher, but we are right on track with revenue synergies in the three areas we have been focusing on since the merger.", "You remember that the three areas of revenue synergies were one selling more self-manufactured products through the Fisher Scientific catalogs. Two, leveraging the company's scale by growing faster in Asia and three focusing specifically on our top 20 largest accounts to gain share. We are very encouraged by our success in each of these three areas. The first one that we started seeing results from early last year was selling more self-manufactured products through our Fisher scientific catalogs and the success of this has significantly added to our margin expansion in the past six quarters.", "And then second, by leveraging our total company footprints, we have also seen faster than market rate revenue growth across Asia, not just in China but also in India and even in Japan. And Asia is now 13% of our total revenue versus 10% at the time of the merger, so an overall acceleration of growth in Asia of about $300 million in just over one year.", "And then lastly, in the past few quarters revenue growth of our top 20 customer counts has been significantly outperforming the company average indicating that our focus on these large customers is also beginning to pay off. So we are progressing well on all these three fronts as a result of being the combined Thermo Fisher Company.", "Now let me make a few comments about our key end markets. We are especially pleased with our performance given the current global economic environment. The newspaper headlines continue to point to how much uncertainty there is in the world. Again, we are not seeing any significant change from what we have reported to you so far this year.", "We saw particular strength and above average growth in our scientific instruments business, our specialty diagnostics business and our BioPharma Services business. From a market point of view, our major life sciences and healthcare end markets remained strong in general with particular strength and demand from CROs. Biotech demand for research products is also very robust but demand for bioprocessing products used in drug production continues to be weak.", "Our industrial markets are holding their own very nicely with high commodities pricing continuing to drive spending and investments by our customers. And then in Q2, sales in our much talked about safety catalog business were flat compared with last year and as a result did not create the headwind for us in organic growth that it did in earlier quarters.", "The impact of declines we have seen in this business should be less significant going forward.", "Again, I believe our size, breadth of portfolio especially our large percentage of consumables, and our global presence give us a key advantage. All of this makes us less vulnerable to market shifts. We also have the resources to continuously invest in the business to develop new technologies and penetrate new markets that allow us to capitalize some opportunities for growth.", "So let me spend a couple of minutes talking about a few of the new developments in our business that will contribute to our growth going forward. First, new products, those of you who attended ASMS, the leading conference on Mass Spectrometry, know that we had a very strong showing again this year.", "These instrument system are sold under our Thermo Scientific brand. The highlights included two break through systems that expand the use of high end analytical tools to more users and applications.", "Firstly, our new vantage is the latest addition to our successful line of Triple Quad Mass Spectrometry system delivering up to ten times more sensitivity for our Life Sciences customers who continue to demand more accurate analysis for their cutting edge protein research.", "Secondly, our new executive LCMS system on the other hand leverages our successful Orbitrap technology in a Benchtop system that is easy for non specialists to operate. It delivers the high resolution, sensitivity and mass accuracy needed to meet analytical challenges in a range of applications.", "So these new systems generated a lot of excitement at the conference and the feedback since then has been extremely positive. Customers are gaining hands-on experience with them in our demonstration labs around the world and these instruments have already started shipping in Q3.", "A quick word on acquisitions, we continue to augment our internal developments with acquisitions that offer complimentary technologies or greater access to new markets. You may recall last quarter, our Bio Sciences business launched our new excel Gene-Silencing Technology which extends the use of synthetic RNAi by making it possible to deliver these reagents into more types of cells.", "Well, this quarter we strengthened our leadership in RNAi with the acquisition of Open Biosystems. This business which has about $15 million in revenues adds a complimentary line RNAi technologies to our existing portfolio. We can now provide scientists with the post comprehensive RNAi tool kit to accelerate the discovery of new therapies in neuroscience, immunology, stem cell science and oncology.", "Just last week, our Bio Scientist business also acquired Affinity BioReagents, a small but leading provider of antibodies, peptides and proteins with revenues of $6 million. This acquisition give us new opportunities to create complete solutions for widely used research applications by combining an extensive BioReagents portfolio with our current Proteomics, 0:32, 5 offerings. We also acquired the analytical and environmental instrument businesses of Chemito to strengthen our presence in India. This is another in a series of investments we have made to expand our footprint in that growing market. And, I will ask Marc Casper, our COO, to say a few words about our activities in India. Marc?", "Marc N. Casper - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Marijn. We continue to make significant investments to strengthen our presence in India, a market we participated in with the direct presence since 2000 through our laboratory equipment and consumables business.", "We began to accelerate our expansion there in 2005 when we opened our state-of-the-art demonstration laboratory in Mumbai. Since then, we have been building our commercial organization, begun construction of a large clinical packaging facility in Ahmedabad and supplemented those activities with two acquisitions in Mumbai in the past year. This is all in an effort to serve the rapidly growing life sciences and industrial markets in that country.", "So what do we gain from these investments? We became the leading supplier of laboratory chemicals to research markets in India with our acquisition of Qualigence in September 2007. This business added about $25 million to our annual revenues. Our recent acquisition of two divisions of Chemito totaling approximately 10 million in annual revenues, gives us a strong position in India in Gas Chromatography and UV-Vis technologies. It is local manufacturing capabilities, and the deep sales and service presence. To me it not only allows us to better penetrate the growing analytical and environment instrument market in India, but should allow us to offer these low-cost instruments in other emerging markets.", "Last, our new clinical packaging facility is on track to open in Q4, the result of a $17 million capital program we initiated last year. When completed this 150,000 square foot facility will help us to meet growing demand for biopharma logistics outsourcing services, in response to the increasing number of clinical trial patients in India. These ongoing investments that we have made at Thermo Fisher, really positions us as the leading life sciences company in India by far.", "Once the clinical packaging facility is open, we'll have more than 20 facilities and offices, and roughly 625 employees across the country, putting us in an excellent position to capitalize on India's future growth. We're already seeing the return on our investments there. Year-to-date we've grown more than 40% over 2007 not including acquisitions, with a run rate for the year of approximately $125 million in revenue.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Marc. Indeed, a very exciting market for with excellent growth prospects. So let me wrap it up by reviewing our guidance for 2008.", "After completing a strong first half, we remain confident in the full year guidance we gave you last quarter. We are maintaining our revenue estimate of $10.6 billion to $10.7 billion for 2008, which would lead to 9% to 10% growth over our 2007 results. And then based on our adjusted EPS performance to date we are increasing the low end of our guidance by $0.4 to a range of $3.11 to $317 for the full year. And this would lead to 17% to 20% adjusted EPS growth over 2007.", "So with that I am going to turn the call over to our CFO, Peter Wilver, for his financial review. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marijn. Good morning, everyone. As Marijn said, we had another record quarter with 22% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.79 compared to $0.65 in Q2 last year. GAAP earnings per share in Q2 were $0.57 up from $0.37 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating performance and favorable discontinued operations. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS.", "Revenues in Q2 increased 14% year-over-year to $2.71 billion. Organic growth was 8% excluding the favorable currency translation of 4% and acquisitions net of divestures of 2%. Organic revenue growth in the quarter particularly in our consumable businesses was enhanced by one day or close to 1% as a result of a shift in the Easter holiday to Q1, as we described on last quarters call.", "Going forward, Q3 will have the same number of days as last year and Q4 will have two more days. Bookings were in line with revenues in the quarter. In the Analytical Technology Segment Q2 revenues rose 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. In the quarter we saw strong organic growth across our life sciences and health care markets. Our industrial markets grew at below the average, but at a pace consistent with the past few quarters.", "New products continue to be a growth driver specifically in our scientific instruments, environmental instruments, molecular diagnostics and life science research product lines. In the laboratory products and services segment, Q2 revenues also increased 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. Notables in the quarter were our biopharma logistics services business which delivered mid-teens organic growth and our safety catalogue business which was flat year-over-year.", "By geography, we saw a strong organic growth across all our major regions with the exception of Europe which grew in the low-single digits, again strong growth than the year ago quarter. North America grew at slightly below the company average and Asia Pacific grew in the mid-20s. The rest of the world grew at around 35% albeit from a relatively small base. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 18% year-over-year to $477 million. Adjusted operating margin up from 17.6% up 60 basis points from 17% n the year ago quarter.", "The margin expansion was driven by pull through on our incremental organic revenues including increased prices, integration synergies and global sourcing and productivity initiatives. This expansion was partially offset by increased inflationary pressure in raw materials and transportation costs, slightly unfavorable business mix and 20 basis points of dilution from higher stock-compensation expense.", "Analytical Technologies Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 21% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 21.1% up 130 basis points versus 19.8% last year. Laboratory products and services Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 14% and adjusted operating margin was flat with the prior year at 14%.", "Margin expansion in this segment was negatively impacted by direct material inflation, net of pricing increases, and unfavorable foreign exchange on our European manufacturing cost base. Adjusted gross margin was 41.3% in Q2 up 30 basis points from 41% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives.", "We are continuing to see increased inflationary pressure on our raw material costs, primarily in steel, raw resin and plastics. We're also experiencing higher fuel and freight costs, a large position of which we've been able to offset in the form of fuel surcharges and increased freight billings. Direct material inflation in the quarter negatively impacted gross margin by about 40 basis points, this inflation was offset by our global sourcing initiatives.", "However, we did not see the same level of margin expansion that we have seen in the past as a result of the higher inflation. We expect raw material inflation to remain a challenge for the remainder of 2008. And we put in place additional sourcing and pricing actions to offset the expected impact. However, the net result is likely to be somewhat dilutive to our gross margin rate.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.3% of revenue in Q2 down 30 basis points from 21.6% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and integration synergies, partially offset by growth investments and higher stock-compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.4% in Q2 down 10 basis points from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $22 million in Q2 down $1 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of a reduction in our net debt and a slightly more favorable interest rate environment.", "Other income was a loss of $1 million down $3 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of currency translation losses on foreign entity cash, and a $1 million write-down related to our $9 million portfolio of auction rate securities.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% in line with our full year 2007 actual and 2008 forecast rates of 24%. The Q2 2008 adjusted tax rate was down 0.6% from the prior year, primarily as a result of the tax planning we implemented during 2007 and early 2008. Average diluted shares were 437 million for the quarter down 9 million from last year, reflecting the benefit of the share buyback program we initiated in Q3 2007 and completed last quarter.", "In terms of balance sheet performance, we ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments up $272 million from Q1, as our free cash flow and proceeds from stock-options were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions. Our total debt was $2.2 billion essentially flat with Q1. We had strong working capital performance in the quarter.", "Accounts receivable days sale outstanding was 53 days down one day from the prior year and down three days from Q1 and inventory days of supply was 72 days down four days from the prior year and down three days from Q1. Year-to-date Q2 cash flow from continuing operations was $590 million and after deducting net capital expenditures of $104 million free cash flow from continuing ops was $486 million.", "Moving on to our 2008 guidance, we are maintaining our previous revenue guidance of $10.6 to $10.7 billion, which represents 9% to 19% growth versus our 2007 actual revenue of $9.75billion. This guidance reflects current exchange rates, incremental revenues from our recently announced acquisitions, and a reduction of approximately $20 million related to the recent two-year extension of our health care catalog businesses contract with Inverness Biosite.", "The 2008 earnings impacts related to the Biosite product contract revenue reduction is less than $0.5. In 2009, we expect an incremental reduction of approximately $60 million in revenue related to this contract, for a total annualized reduction of approximately $80 million in revenue from our current run-rate. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are increasing the low ends of our guidance by $0.04, resulting in our current guidance of 3.11 to 3.17, which represents 17% to 20% versus the 265, we recorded in 2007.", "With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys, Mike Dauchy [ph] here for Ross. He is another call, but congratulations on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "I want to talk a little bit about some of the raw material stuff you mentioned, some of the sourcing initiatives you are taking. How quickly will those take shape and could you talk a little more about those versus the pricing impact you have and some of the offsets you're making?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in terms of the sourcing initiatives, those are something that we have been working on since the beginning of Thermo Electron eight years ago. So, it is not anything new for us, but we are initiating some incremental actions to try to help offset some of the inflation that we are seeing. And as you mentioned, we are raising prices in some specific businesses to try to offset that. What we expect to see is, probably a slightly negative impact in Q3 in terms of the net of those actions and then in Q4, to essentially make it all backup in the quarter with maybe a little bit extra to offset what we missed in Q3. So in terms of dollars, we are talking in the single millions of dollars of hurt in Q3 and maybe a couple of million benefit net, when you get to Q4.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "That's what we saw, but just wanted to clarify. And then just talk a little bit more about the emerging markets. China has been a stronger market for you post Thermo Fisher merger and India is showing tremendous growth. Can you talk about a little more about any more of the emerging markets you are seeing pockets of growth and what are the next strong opportunities for you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Mark this is Marijn. Obviously, China and India have been very good. Other areas are places like the Middle East. Quite a lot of investment going into new universities that are being built in Saudi Arabia, for instance, or just in general, you know, with supporting infrastructure with hospitals, universities, and then also petrochemical industries that is doing very well there. We are also seeing very good demand in countries that are particularly strong in mining, minerals. So, places like Australia, Chile, Russia who are booming right now from a materials point of view. We see strong demand for instrument systems that help them analyze, what it is that they are mining.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Well, thanks again and congratulations again on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Congratulations as was said. By all indications, it was a phenomenal, phenomenal quarter. I think one question people will have is probably, if anything that would put a little bit of a lid on a great quarter is the guidance that you gave. So, can you maybe just explain, are you seeing anything different in your and, is this kind of a cautious view just given, you said the headline news you read in the newspapers and not knowing what's going to happen in terms of the top-line that you're maintaining given the very good growth obviously this quarter and then maybe some of the margin things you've talked about on the bottom end. I'm just trying to better understand if you're expecting things to slow a little or if this is just kind of cautious given you want to be conservative?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jon, I will take the question. So that from the 30,000 feet point of view, we did raise the bottom end of our EPS margin by $0.04 and being two quarters into the year, we feel comfortable about that. We raised our overall guidance range by $0.02 last quarter, so we are sitting in the middle of the year. We have had a very good first half. We are confident that we have a very good second half. But at the same time with the material, raw material pressure, our ability to pass on pricing increases, the overall uncertainty around the industrial economy, there is enough uncertainty in the world and therefore insubtleties [ph] around our P&L that we say, lets just stay where we are for now.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And how... can you just describe the process... there was a lot of concern going in about the rising cost of oil-based products. Can you maybe just describe, the lag of, how that works? For example, oil prices have fallen quite dramatically over the last little bit.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And so how that would kind of flow throughout a given year and how you have kind of prepared for it at the beginning of the year and where you are today?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The way it works is, these price increases work themselves through the system, very often relatively slowly. For instance, oil has been going up for quite awhile but it was only two or three months ago that, for instance, a company like Dow Chemical said, we just cannot take these increases any more and not really very aggressively try to pass them on. So, they came out with a 20% to 25% price increase across the board, I think it was three months ago. A month later another 20% to 25% price increase on certain plastics resin across the board. So, they reached a point where they said, okay, some contracts are expiring, we need to start passing this stuff on. And that's when we as resin buyers become affected by it pretty much sometimes six to nine months later because it gets held up with the plastic resins manufacturer, okay.", "So, these pricing systems work themselves through the system from one to the next, to the next supplier customer relationship. We are right now in the middle of the storm of getting these price increases from our suppliers and our job is to find ways to pass these increased costs on to our customers. And that also leads to some delay again, more with some customers than with others. But if we have contracts, we cannot just abruptly increase prices. So, it takes time and that's why oil now is suddenly going down by $20. Isn't going to rapidly reverse it.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I didn't know, if as you see oil coming down if some of the price increases they have announced maybe don't stick because customers start saying, no, look, oils coming down. We have our own demand issues. I assume you are not, more a price taker in general on some of these resin-based products?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think everybody understands how this works itself through the system. The increase in resin prices have been so well documented that all of our customers know that this is reality and it is not something that we are making up. This is really there. And that's also why sometimes having these price increases take hold, takes some time because customers want to be convinced that indeed you are as a supplier experiencing that cost pressure. I don't think there is any question.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Just relative to Q2 then of what you saw, and what you are expecting, Pete, as you were describing in Q3, it seems like you are impacted to some degree in Q2, but you were able to have start pretty good gross margin expansion. Do you expect a bigger impact in Q3 relative to Q2?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think the impact will be slightly bigger in Q2, excuse me in Q3 than it was in Q2. But at the same time we have already initiated some mitigating actions. So, it's not going to be a dramatic change. Again, talking single digit millions probably, which on our revenue base is not a huge margin impact.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The thing to keep in mind though just, one of the comments I made about it being dilutive to our gross margin. If we get 10 million of price increases for raw materials, we pass it 100% to the customers, it doesn't affect our gross margin dollars, but it does dilute our rate because we basically get revenue at zero margin.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, it is not hurting our guidance in our earnings per share, but it affects the rate a little bit.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And, then last question. You mentioned that the Biotech Manufacturing business, your Bioprocess business, you still expect that to recover some here in the second half?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that at some point, maybe not in the third quarter but certainly in the fourth quarter the comparisons are going to get easier, because then we will, this has been going on for two, maybe three quarters. So I think, in other quarter, probably relatively weak in Q3 and then Q4 should be better.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks Marijn. Congratulations, very outstanding quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Jon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys this is Dennis for Derik.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Morning. Just thinking about the use of cash. Obviously your, guidance assumes no share purchases, but you announced the buyback authorization in I believe last August. I was wondering whether you guys might be willing to comment on whether we could see something similar in terms of timing this year.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't really want to comment on our share purchase strategy. I can make a general comment on uses of cash. Our top priority for the use of cash is to do acquisition and you are seeing, we have been doing some smaller strategic acquisitions that are well positioned in terms of technology additions or access to markets like what Marc Casper was talking about with India. So that's the use of our cash and that's the preferred use of our cash, but we don't exclude other buyback programs. There is just not one ongoing right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you. Looking at cash again, I know that you said that you had an interest expense reduction on the quarter, but it also looks like interest income came up by about 50%. I was wondering whether that's due to anything more than just simply cash in the bank?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, as I said there is a slightly more favorable interest rate environment, but it's primarily the incremental cash.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay thanks.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning guys. This is actually Matt for Quintin. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Matt.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Marijn just quickly, touching on some of the markets could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market front?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, think that academic is, it's okay. It's not super robust. NIH is not really a fantastic number. It is sort of flattish as you know. But that's said, I think that we are in a good place in terms of getting a good portion of what NIH is spending because a lot of the spending goes to new life sciences applications, biomarkers, Proteomics, RNAi technology, stem cell research to some extent. And being, in those sort of hot spots right now helped us get us maybe more than a fair share of the NIH funding overall.", "And I have also made the comment in the past, something we don't really keep track of because it's so hard to keep track of it, but it plays definitely a role, is that there are a lot of charitable gifts, large charitable gifts to life sciences research, healthcare research, universities, new laboratories that are being built with significant money donated by wealthy people that fuels the demand for laboratory equipment, laboratory instruments. And we don't really count it, but it is a really, sort of nice part of the academic growth story.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that color. Just moving back to Asian growth has been really nice here. Have you been able to kind of draw a line in terms of how the catalog release in China is favorably impacting that business here and kind of the early returns there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The catalog that we came out with three months ago is not really impacting these phenomenal numbers at this point. It's way too early for that. I mean, we hope in the future that it will begin to contribute, but it has contributed a little bit in the second quarter but not in a meaningful way to affect these numbers. The catalog is pretty simple. Legacy Fisher had a very, very tiny position in China and in India from a catalog point of view. And we have aggressively, first in China gone out and put a catalog together in the Chinese language and we expect that over time we will start gaining share there in a market that is about, we estimate $800 million on laboratory consumables at the moment just in China.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that and congratulations again.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the turns in the pharma at the moment with the kind of weak Biotech funding market and cutbacks in spending that are affecting you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Peter, could you repeat the question, please.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wonder, if you could talk about the turn in the Pharma market with a weak Biotech funding and cutbacks in spending? How has that been affecting you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have not really seen weakness in Biotech spending other than what I was commenting on in Biotech processing for the production of drugs. But from an R&D demand point of view of view it has been very robust. And pharma, I was mentioning we are growing significantly with our top 20 customers. A lot of them are obviously large pharma and we are doing very well on average with large pharma customers. We believe that we are gaining share with those customers. So we may be seeing some conservativism with large pharma in very high ticket capital good items in Q2, but other than that, pharma demands have been very good.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "What's the M&A environment like, and what do you think the likelihood is of further consolidation in the Life Sciences spaces going to be going forward and what kind of impact, I'm thinking about coming from ABI and (inaudible) Bill.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think... and I have always said this... when I joined this industry eight years ago, I couldn't believe how fragmented the industry is, how unconsolidated, how many players there were. Now its eight years later, I still cannot believe how fragmented this industry is. It's less fragmented than eight years ago, but compared to any other industry it's still a highly fragmented industry quite honestly. Just goes to one of the trade shows, Sitcom or Analytica that happened just a few months ago and you walk around and say my goodness how can all these company exist in one industry? So I believe that there will be further consolidation going forward. It just makes sense from an industry dynamics point of view.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "You are kind of expecting to see more kind of ABI and (inaudible) deals going forward?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know. I can't comment on exactly what would happen, but I would say in general some consolidation will continue I would think.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you so much. I will hop back into the queue.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann. Issac Please go ahead with your question. Could you press your mute button.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. I think, I was thinking the question. I think in the past month, you talked a little bit about having a couple quarters with visibility ahead of material economic slowdowns, and I know it is a very macro type of question, but I'm wondering, would you still say that's the case today and if so how do you feel about 2009 for your end markets in the industrial segment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, this is on a certain segment of our products and process instruments, where we provide instrumentation that goes into either capacity expansion of existing plants or new plants that are being built to basically do the in-line quality control of say a refinery or something like that, basically a chemical process. And I would say that we see no decline in terms of the next two quarters in that area. And we relate that to just still exceptionally high-commodity pricing. People have decided to expand their capacity, and they've decided that three months ago, and they are drawing up the plans, they begin to order this equipment.", "But the lead time on that is sometimes six months or so because they can only receive that equipment when they have made some good progress with building the plant. So we come in as a last moment sort of just before the plant gets started up. And that's why we have some visibility from a backlog point of view. But those decisions have been made already in the past. We just know that our sales will be there for the next few quarters in that particular area. And as I said, you know, this continues to be strong because commodity prices are high.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Sure, okay. Thanks. And then, just regarding the Asian marketplace. Could you qualify maybe a little bit how that growth is driven when you compare sort of new lab build outs versus maybe incremental share gains? And then secondly on that question, how would you characterize the nature of your product mix there, has that evolved in a meaningful way in the last two or three years?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll start with the last one first. Given the tremendous focus that we've had in the legacy thermo business on places like China, the mix in terms of scientific instruments and laboratory equipment is higher in those countries than laboratory consumables. Okay, now, that will gradually change. But right now, I would say the mix is richer in sort of the legacy thermo electron product line. And it is a very, very wide range of applications there in China.", "To begin with the obvious, environmental applications are very, very, key, the build out of life sciences laboratories, university laboratories, hospitals is key, and the third one, that's very strong right now, is anything that's related to food quality monitoring, with some of the hiccups that the Chinese exports have had in terms of food safety. So it's a wide range of applications. And I would just say that China is really strong across the border.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Banc of America.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. Pete, given the better working capital performance in the quarter what's keeping you from raising the cash outlook for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I should have expected that question from you, Jon.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Better than ten questions on the mid-single millions of inflation issue.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. It's basically I've given guidance of about $1.2 billion of cash flow for the year. If we're going to beat that number, it will be in the working capital area. But we do have a lot of headwind versus last year on taxes, that's we're just paying more cash taxes this year than we paid in 2007. So at this point the working capital metrics are better. But if you look at the cash usage on working capital it is actually up significantly versus last year.", "At this point, I'm not sure whether that's because of where the quarter ended, which this year we kind of got dinged both in Q1 and Q2, then the last calendar day was outside of our fiscal calendar. So if things go well in Q3 I will raise the number.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then, CapEx I mean you're running a bit below annualized guidance.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Are you still looking for 230 to 240?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's definitely going to be in that range, 250 I think is the guidance that I've given in the past.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then Marijn, back on the momentum in the top-20, can you give us or quantitate somewhat that growth profile. I mean is it in excess of 10% organically?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I want to be careful with that because it's such a small number of customers. So competitively I want to be careful with that. But if I say we have 8% organic growth. If I say that we are significantly outgrowing the average of the company I think you can conclude that it's higher than 10.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And where is... I mean where is that share coming from, are you consolidating more product to the channel, is it coming from other distributors, what's your sense of where that's coming from?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very broad based growth. First of all I think that those large customers want to consolidate their purchasing with fewer suppliers. We are obviously there with a very focused sales executive team at each of these customers to make them very aware of what Thermo Fisher can offer, help them make it easier to do business with us. So I think just our focus and our size is making them do more business with us. We go really the extra mile for these plenty of customers. So, that's one. And then I think there is also a number of programs that we have initiated around standardization at some customers where you say we can help you standardize your purchases. Have less fragmentation in the types of products you buy and that is also beginning to contribute.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sheng Chi Nem [ph] with JPMorgan.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Hi guys, sitting here Tycho today. Thanks for taking the question. First question is for your, going back to your top 20 accounts. Could you to the extent that you can breakout kind of the rough breakdown of the accounts by end markets in geography.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I will try. It is a typical suspect... the usual suspect, I guess. It is basically when you say large pharma, large Biotech are in there. And some of the larger reference labs. So, I would say probably 65% of that is in the US and 35% in Europe.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "And then could you also comment on your overall mass spec business, given kind of the new product line, to increasing product line to how done all those things competitively. If it is taking market share and also kind of comment on pricing?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean mass spec is, it continues to be a very good story for us. As I was mentioning in my comments we came out with again some exciting new... new platforms at ASMS, which we have had very good reaction to. Now, I think that in terms of share... I believe we are gaining share in this market. It is in the end hard to know because most competitors including us don't specifically comment on growth in mass spec, but from what we are seeing and what we are hearing and the feedback we get at the ASMS surveys, we believe that we are continuing to gain share.", "And have done so quite honestly for the last four to five years. I think from a pricing point of view this is not a price sensitive market in general with maybe a few exceptions in some certain industries or certain product lines. But in general life sciences researchers are very keen on having the best instrumentation and why do all the work if you then put your sample into mass spec, that doesn't give you the answers that are truly available today. So, there is a strong demand from the high end researchers to really want to have the best possible equipment. And that drives the replacement cycle that works in our favor.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. No more questions?", "Operator", "I'm not showing any questions.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. All right. Let me just make a quick closing comment. As you've heard, record performance in Q2, very strong first half. We believe as a result of that we are well positioned to meet our growth goals for the year. We continue to invest in new products and new markets that will contribute to our growth in the future. And want to thank you for your support for being on the call today and we look forward to reporting on our progress again after Q3. So again, thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno,you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno - Vice President, Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, we have Marijn Dekkers, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Marc Casper, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and Peter Wilver, our Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this car is being webcast live and will be archived on our website, thermofisher.com, until August 29th, 2008. To reach the replay of the call on our website, click on investors and webcast and presentation. Please also be aware that a copy of the press release setting forth our second quarter 2008 earnings in future expectations is available in the investor section on our website, under the heading financial results.", "I would like to begin by reading the safe harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the safe harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's form 10-Q, for the quarter end March 29th, 2008, under the caption risk factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the investors section of our website under the heading SEA filings.", "While we may like to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change and therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "During the call, we will referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP.

Related information is also available on the investor section of our website under the heading webcast and presentation.", "So, with that I would now like to turn the call over to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I know there are number of companies in our space are competing for your attention this morning. So, thank you very much for joining us. I think you will be glad you did because it was a very good quarter. As you saw in our press release, we had another record quarter in Q2 with strong performance in all of our key financial metrics. So, let me get right to the highlights.", "First, we had a really strong revenue growth quarter with a 14% increase to $2.7 billion. Adjusted EPS rose by 22% and our adjusted operating income increased 18%, and we also achieved 60 bases points of adjusted operating margin expansion, so a terrific growth quarter.", "I believe our success is the result of our sound business model. As you've heard me say before, we do not run this company quarter-by-quarter focused on any one single financial goal. Instead, we work to achieve a balance of our four key financial metrics, which are revenues, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. And we believe that this approach is the best way for us to generate growth that is sustainable and creates value for shareholders over the long-term.", "Our performance in Q2 puts us right where we expected to be halfway through the year and this positions us to meet our growth goals for the full year in 2008. Our results year-to-date also show that not only have we achieved our cost energy targets from the merger of Thermo Fisher, but we are right on track with revenue synergies in the three areas we have been focusing on since the merger.", "You remember that the three areas of revenue synergies were one selling more self-manufactured products through the Fisher Scientific catalogs. Two, leveraging the company's scale by growing faster in Asia and three focusing specifically on our top 20 largest accounts to gain share. We are very encouraged by our success in each of these three areas. The first one that we started seeing results from early last year was selling more self-manufactured products through our Fisher scientific catalogs and the success of this has significantly added to our margin expansion in the past six quarters.", "And then second, by leveraging our total company footprints, we have also seen faster than market rate revenue growth across Asia, not just in China but also in India and even in Japan. And Asia is now 13% of our total revenue versus 10% at the time of the merger, so an overall acceleration of growth in Asia of about $300 million in just over one year.", "And then lastly, in the past few quarters revenue growth of our top 20 customer counts has been significantly outperforming the company average indicating that our focus on these large customers is also beginning to pay off. So we are progressing well on all these three fronts as a result of being the combined Thermo Fisher Company.", "Now let me make a few comments about our key end markets. We are especially pleased with our performance given the current global economic environment. The newspaper headlines continue to point to how much uncertainty there is in the world. Again, we are not seeing any significant change from what we have reported to you so far this year.", "We saw particular strength and above average growth in our scientific instruments business, our specialty diagnostics business and our BioPharma Services business. From a market point of view, our major life sciences and healthcare end markets remained strong in general with particular strength and demand from CROs. Biotech demand for research products is also very robust but demand for bioprocessing products used in drug production continues to be weak.", "Our industrial markets are holding their own very nicely with high commodities pricing continuing to drive spending and investments by our customers. And then in Q2, sales in our much talked about safety catalog business were flat compared with last year and as a result did not create the headwind for us in organic growth that it did in earlier quarters.", "The impact of declines we have seen in this business should be less significant going forward.", "Again, I believe our size, breadth of portfolio especially our large percentage of consumables, and our global presence give us a key advantage. All of this makes us less vulnerable to market shifts. We also have the resources to continuously invest in the business to develop new technologies and penetrate new markets that allow us to capitalize some opportunities for growth.", "So let me spend a couple of minutes talking about a few of the new developments in our business that will contribute to our growth going forward. First, new products, those of you who attended ASMS, the leading conference on Mass Spectrometry, know that we had a very strong showing again this year.", "These instrument system are sold under our Thermo Scientific brand. The highlights included two break through systems that expand the use of high end analytical tools to more users and applications.", "Firstly, our new vantage is the latest addition to our successful line of Triple Quad Mass Spectrometry system delivering up to ten times more sensitivity for our Life Sciences customers who continue to demand more accurate analysis for their cutting edge protein research.", "Secondly, our new executive LCMS system on the other hand leverages our successful Orbitrap technology in a Benchtop system that is easy for non specialists to operate. It delivers the high resolution, sensitivity and mass accuracy needed to meet analytical challenges in a range of applications.", "So these new systems generated a lot of excitement at the conference and the feedback since then has been extremely positive. Customers are gaining hands-on experience with them in our demonstration labs around the world and these instruments have already started shipping in Q3.", "A quick word on acquisitions, we continue to augment our internal developments with acquisitions that offer complimentary technologies or greater access to new markets. You may recall last quarter, our Bio Sciences business launched our new excel Gene-Silencing Technology which extends the use of synthetic RNAi by making it possible to deliver these reagents into more types of cells.", "Well, this quarter we strengthened our leadership in RNAi with the acquisition of Open Biosystems. This business which has about $15 million in revenues adds a complimentary line RNAi technologies to our existing portfolio. We can now provide scientists with the post comprehensive RNAi tool kit to accelerate the discovery of new therapies in neuroscience, immunology, stem cell science and oncology.", "Just last week, our Bio Scientist business also acquired Affinity BioReagents, a small but leading provider of antibodies, peptides and proteins with revenues of $6 million. This acquisition give us new opportunities to create complete solutions for widely used research applications by combining an extensive BioReagents portfolio with our current Proteomics, 0:32, 5 offerings. We also acquired the analytical and environmental instrument businesses of Chemito to strengthen our presence in India. This is another in a series of investments we have made to expand our footprint in that growing market. And, I will ask Marc Casper, our COO, to say a few words about our activities in India. Marc?", "Marc N. Casper - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Marijn. We continue to make significant investments to strengthen our presence in India, a market we participated in with the direct presence since 2000 through our laboratory equipment and consumables business.", "We began to accelerate our expansion there in 2005 when we opened our state-of-the-art demonstration laboratory in Mumbai. Since then, we have been building our commercial organization, begun construction of a large clinical packaging facility in Ahmedabad and supplemented those activities with two acquisitions in Mumbai in the past year. This is all in an effort to serve the rapidly growing life sciences and industrial markets in that country.", "So what do we gain from these investments? We became the leading supplier of laboratory chemicals to research markets in India with our acquisition of Qualigence in September 2007. This business added about $25 million to our annual revenues. Our recent acquisition of two divisions of Chemito totaling approximately 10 million in annual revenues, gives us a strong position in India in Gas Chromatography and UV-Vis technologies. It is local manufacturing capabilities, and the deep sales and service presence. To me it not only allows us to better penetrate the growing analytical and environment instrument market in India, but should allow us to offer these low-cost instruments in other emerging markets.", "Last, our new clinical packaging facility is on track to open in Q4, the result of a $17 million capital program we initiated last year. When completed this 150,000 square foot facility will help us to meet growing demand for biopharma logistics outsourcing services, in response to the increasing number of clinical trial patients in India. These ongoing investments that we have made at Thermo Fisher, really positions us as the leading life sciences company in India by far.", "Once the clinical packaging facility is open, we'll have more than 20 facilities and offices, and roughly 625 employees across the country, putting us in an excellent position to capitalize on India's future growth. We're already seeing the return on our investments there. Year-to-date we've grown more than 40% over 2007 not including acquisitions, with a run rate for the year of approximately $125 million in revenue.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Marc. Indeed, a very exciting market for with excellent growth prospects. So let me wrap it up by reviewing our guidance for 2008.", "After completing a strong first half, we remain confident in the full year guidance we gave you last quarter. We are maintaining our revenue estimate of $10.6 billion to $10.7 billion for 2008, which would lead to 9% to 10% growth over our 2007 results. And then based on our adjusted EPS performance to date we are increasing the low end of our guidance by $0.4 to a range of $3.11 to $317 for the full year. And this would lead to 17% to 20% adjusted EPS growth over 2007.", "So with that I am going to turn the call over to our CFO, Peter Wilver, for his financial review. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marijn. Good morning, everyone. As Marijn said, we had another record quarter with 22% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.79 compared to $0.65 in Q2 last year. GAAP earnings per share in Q2 were $0.57 up from $0.37 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating performance and favorable discontinued operations. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS.", "Revenues in Q2 increased 14% year-over-year to $2.71 billion. Organic growth was 8% excluding the favorable currency translation of 4% and acquisitions net of divestures of 2%. Organic revenue growth in the quarter particularly in our consumable businesses was enhanced by one day or close to 1% as a result of a shift in the Easter holiday to Q1, as we described on last quarters call.", "Going forward, Q3 will have the same number of days as last year and Q4 will have two more days. Bookings were in line with revenues in the quarter. In the Analytical Technology Segment Q2 revenues rose 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. In the quarter we saw strong organic growth across our life sciences and health care markets. Our industrial markets grew at below the average, but at a pace consistent with the past few quarters.", "New products continue to be a growth driver specifically in our scientific instruments, environmental instruments, molecular diagnostics and life science research product lines. In the laboratory products and services segment, Q2 revenues also increased 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. Notables in the quarter were our biopharma logistics services business which delivered mid-teens organic growth and our safety catalogue business which was flat year-over-year.", "By geography, we saw a strong organic growth across all our major regions with the exception of Europe which grew in the low-single digits, again strong growth than the year ago quarter. North America grew at slightly below the company average and Asia Pacific grew in the mid-20s. The rest of the world grew at around 35% albeit from a relatively small base. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 18% year-over-year to $477 million. Adjusted operating margin up from 17.6% up 60 basis points from 17% n the year ago quarter.", "The margin expansion was driven by pull through on our incremental organic revenues including increased prices, integration synergies and global sourcing and productivity initiatives. This expansion was partially offset by increased inflationary pressure in raw materials and transportation costs, slightly unfavorable business mix and 20 basis points of dilution from higher stock-compensation expense.", "Analytical Technologies Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 21% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 21.1% up 130 basis points versus 19.8% last year. Laboratory products and services Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 14% and adjusted operating margin was flat with the prior year at 14%.", "Margin expansion in this segment was negatively impacted by direct material inflation, net of pricing increases, and unfavorable foreign exchange on our European manufacturing cost base. Adjusted gross margin was 41.3% in Q2 up 30 basis points from 41% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives.", "We are continuing to see increased inflationary pressure on our raw material costs, primarily in steel, raw resin and plastics. We're also experiencing higher fuel and freight costs, a large position of which we've been able to offset in the form of fuel surcharges and increased freight billings. Direct material inflation in the quarter negatively impacted gross margin by about 40 basis points, this inflation was offset by our global sourcing initiatives.", "However, we did not see the same level of margin expansion that we have seen in the past as a result of the higher inflation. We expect raw material inflation to remain a challenge for the remainder of 2008. And we put in place additional sourcing and pricing actions to offset the expected impact. However, the net result is likely to be somewhat dilutive to our gross margin rate.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.3% of revenue in Q2 down 30 basis points from 21.6% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and integration synergies, partially offset by growth investments and higher stock-compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.4% in Q2 down 10 basis points from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $22 million in Q2 down $1 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of a reduction in our net debt and a slightly more favorable interest rate environment.", "Other income was a loss of $1 million down $3 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of currency translation losses on foreign entity cash, and a $1 million write-down related to our $9 million portfolio of auction rate securities.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% in line with our full year 2007 actual and 2008 forecast rates of 24%. The Q2 2008 adjusted tax rate was down 0.6% from the prior year, primarily as a result of the tax planning we implemented during 2007 and early 2008. Average diluted shares were 437 million for the quarter down 9 million from last year, reflecting the benefit of the share buyback program we initiated in Q3 2007 and completed last quarter.", "In terms of balance sheet performance, we ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments up $272 million from Q1, as our free cash flow and proceeds from stock-options were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions. Our total debt was $2.2 billion essentially flat with Q1. We had strong working capital performance in the quarter.", "Accounts receivable days sale outstanding was 53 days down one day from the prior year and down three days from Q1 and inventory days of supply was 72 days down four days from the prior year and down three days from Q1. Year-to-date Q2 cash flow from continuing operations was $590 million and after deducting net capital expenditures of $104 million free cash flow from continuing ops was $486 million.", "Moving on to our 2008 guidance, we are maintaining our previous revenue guidance of $10.6 to $10.7 billion, which represents 9% to 19% growth versus our 2007 actual revenue of $9.75billion. This guidance reflects current exchange rates, incremental revenues from our recently announced acquisitions, and a reduction of approximately $20 million related to the recent two-year extension of our health care catalog businesses contract with Inverness Biosite.", "The 2008 earnings impacts related to the Biosite product contract revenue reduction is less than $0.5. In 2009, we expect an incremental reduction of approximately $60 million in revenue related to this contract, for a total annualized reduction of approximately $80 million in revenue from our current run-rate. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are increasing the low ends of our guidance by $0.04, resulting in our current guidance of 3.11 to 3.17, which represents 17% to 20% versus the 265, we recorded in 2007.", "With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys, Mike Dauchy [ph] here for Ross. He is another call, but congratulations on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "I want to talk a little bit about some of the raw material stuff you mentioned, some of the sourcing initiatives you are taking. How quickly will those take shape and could you talk a little more about those versus the pricing impact you have and some of the offsets you're making?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in terms of the sourcing initiatives, those are something that we have been working on since the beginning of Thermo Electron eight years ago. So, it is not anything new for us, but we are initiating some incremental actions to try to help offset some of the inflation that we are seeing. And as you mentioned, we are raising prices in some specific businesses to try to offset that. What we expect to see is, probably a slightly negative impact in Q3 in terms of the net of those actions and then in Q4, to essentially make it all backup in the quarter with maybe a little bit extra to offset what we missed in Q3. So in terms of dollars, we are talking in the single millions of dollars of hurt in Q3 and maybe a couple of million benefit net, when you get to Q4.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "That's what we saw, but just wanted to clarify. And then just talk a little bit more about the emerging markets. China has been a stronger market for you post Thermo Fisher merger and India is showing tremendous growth. Can you talk about a little more about any more of the emerging markets you are seeing pockets of growth and what are the next strong opportunities for you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Mark this is Marijn. Obviously, China and India have been very good. Other areas are places like the Middle East. Quite a lot of investment going into new universities that are being built in Saudi Arabia, for instance, or just in general, you know, with supporting infrastructure with hospitals, universities, and then also petrochemical industries that is doing very well there. We are also seeing very good demand in countries that are particularly strong in mining, minerals. So, places like Australia, Chile, Russia who are booming right now from a materials point of view. We see strong demand for instrument systems that help them analyze, what it is that they are mining.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Well, thanks again and congratulations again on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Congratulations as was said. By all indications, it was a phenomenal, phenomenal quarter. I think one question people will have is probably, if anything that would put a little bit of a lid on a great quarter is the guidance that you gave. So, can you maybe just explain, are you seeing anything different in your and, is this kind of a cautious view just given, you said the headline news you read in the newspapers and not knowing what's going to happen in terms of the top-line that you're maintaining given the very good growth obviously this quarter and then maybe some of the margin things you've talked about on the bottom end. I'm just trying to better understand if you're expecting things to slow a little or if this is just kind of cautious given you want to be conservative?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jon, I will take the question. So that from the 30,000 feet point of view, we did raise the bottom end of our EPS margin by $0.04 and being two quarters into the year, we feel comfortable about that. We raised our overall guidance range by $0.02 last quarter, so we are sitting in the middle of the year. We have had a very good first half. We are confident that we have a very good second half. But at the same time with the material, raw material pressure, our ability to pass on pricing increases, the overall uncertainty around the industrial economy, there is enough uncertainty in the world and therefore insubtleties [ph] around our P&L that we say, lets just stay where we are for now.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And how... can you just describe the process... there was a lot of concern going in about the rising cost of oil-based products. Can you maybe just describe, the lag of, how that works? For example, oil prices have fallen quite dramatically over the last little bit.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And so how that would kind of flow throughout a given year and how you have kind of prepared for it at the beginning of the year and where you are today?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The way it works is, these price increases work themselves through the system, very often relatively slowly. For instance, oil has been going up for quite awhile but it was only two or three months ago that, for instance, a company like Dow Chemical said, we just cannot take these increases any more and not really very aggressively try to pass them on. So, they came out with a 20% to 25% price increase across the board, I think it was three months ago. A month later another 20% to 25% price increase on certain plastics resin across the board. So, they reached a point where they said, okay, some contracts are expiring, we need to start passing this stuff on. And that's when we as resin buyers become affected by it pretty much sometimes six to nine months later because it gets held up with the plastic resins manufacturer, okay.", "So, these pricing systems work themselves through the system from one to the next, to the next supplier customer relationship. We are right now in the middle of the storm of getting these price increases from our suppliers and our job is to find ways to pass these increased costs on to our customers. And that also leads to some delay again, more with some customers than with others. But if we have contracts, we cannot just abruptly increase prices. So, it takes time and that's why oil now is suddenly going down by $20. Isn't going to rapidly reverse it.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I didn't know, if as you see oil coming down if some of the price increases they have announced maybe don't stick because customers start saying, no, look, oils coming down. We have our own demand issues. I assume you are not, more a price taker in general on some of these resin-based products?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think everybody understands how this works itself through the system. The increase in resin prices have been so well documented that all of our customers know that this is reality and it is not something that we are making up. This is really there. And that's also why sometimes having these price increases take hold, takes some time because customers want to be convinced that indeed you are as a supplier experiencing that cost pressure. I don't think there is any question.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Just relative to Q2 then of what you saw, and what you are expecting, Pete, as you were describing in Q3, it seems like you are impacted to some degree in Q2, but you were able to have start pretty good gross margin expansion. Do you expect a bigger impact in Q3 relative to Q2?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think the impact will be slightly bigger in Q2, excuse me in Q3 than it was in Q2. But at the same time we have already initiated some mitigating actions. So, it's not going to be a dramatic change. Again, talking single digit millions probably, which on our revenue base is not a huge margin impact.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The thing to keep in mind though just, one of the comments I made about it being dilutive to our gross margin. If we get 10 million of price increases for raw materials, we pass it 100% to the customers, it doesn't affect our gross margin dollars, but it does dilute our rate because we basically get revenue at zero margin.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, it is not hurting our guidance in our earnings per share, but it affects the rate a little bit.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And, then last question. You mentioned that the Biotech Manufacturing business, your Bioprocess business, you still expect that to recover some here in the second half?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that at some point, maybe not in the third quarter but certainly in the fourth quarter the comparisons are going to get easier, because then we will, this has been going on for two, maybe three quarters. So I think, in other quarter, probably relatively weak in Q3 and then Q4 should be better.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks Marijn. Congratulations, very outstanding quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Jon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys this is Dennis for Derik.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Morning. Just thinking about the use of cash. Obviously your, guidance assumes no share purchases, but you announced the buyback authorization in I believe last August. I was wondering whether you guys might be willing to comment on whether we could see something similar in terms of timing this year.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't really want to comment on our share purchase strategy. I can make a general comment on uses of cash. Our top priority for the use of cash is to do acquisition and you are seeing, we have been doing some smaller strategic acquisitions that are well positioned in terms of technology additions or access to markets like what Marc Casper was talking about with India. So that's the use of our cash and that's the preferred use of our cash, but we don't exclude other buyback programs. There is just not one ongoing right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you. Looking at cash again, I know that you said that you had an interest expense reduction on the quarter, but it also looks like interest income came up by about 50%. I was wondering whether that's due to anything more than just simply cash in the bank?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, as I said there is a slightly more favorable interest rate environment, but it's primarily the incremental cash.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay thanks.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning guys. This is actually Matt for Quintin. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Matt.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Marijn just quickly, touching on some of the markets could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market front?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, think that academic is, it's okay. It's not super robust. NIH is not really a fantastic number. It is sort of flattish as you know. But that's said, I think that we are in a good place in terms of getting a good portion of what NIH is spending because a lot of the spending goes to new life sciences applications, biomarkers, Proteomics, RNAi technology, stem cell research to some extent. And being, in those sort of hot spots right now helped us get us maybe more than a fair share of the NIH funding overall.", "And I have also made the comment in the past, something we don't really keep track of because it's so hard to keep track of it, but it plays definitely a role, is that there are a lot of charitable gifts, large charitable gifts to life sciences research, healthcare research, universities, new laboratories that are being built with significant money donated by wealthy people that fuels the demand for laboratory equipment, laboratory instruments. And we don't really count it, but it is a really, sort of nice part of the academic growth story.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that color. Just moving back to Asian growth has been really nice here. Have you been able to kind of draw a line in terms of how the catalog release in China is favorably impacting that business here and kind of the early returns there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The catalog that we came out with three months ago is not really impacting these phenomenal numbers at this point. It's way too early for that. I mean, we hope in the future that it will begin to contribute, but it has contributed a little bit in the second quarter but not in a meaningful way to affect these numbers. The catalog is pretty simple. Legacy Fisher had a very, very tiny position in China and in India from a catalog point of view. And we have aggressively, first in China gone out and put a catalog together in the Chinese language and we expect that over time we will start gaining share there in a market that is about, we estimate $800 million on laboratory consumables at the moment just in China.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that and congratulations again.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the turns in the pharma at the moment with the kind of weak Biotech funding market and cutbacks in spending that are affecting you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Peter, could you repeat the question, please.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wonder, if you could talk about the turn in the Pharma market with a weak Biotech funding and cutbacks in spending? How has that been affecting you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have not really seen weakness in Biotech spending other than what I was commenting on in Biotech processing for the production of drugs. But from an R&D demand point of view of view it has been very robust. And pharma, I was mentioning we are growing significantly with our top 20 customers. A lot of them are obviously large pharma and we are doing very well on average with large pharma customers. We believe that we are gaining share with those customers. So we may be seeing some conservativism with large pharma in very high ticket capital good items in Q2, but other than that, pharma demands have been very good.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "What's the M&A environment like, and what do you think the likelihood is of further consolidation in the Life Sciences spaces going to be going forward and what kind of impact, I'm thinking about coming from ABI and (inaudible) Bill.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think... and I have always said this... when I joined this industry eight years ago, I couldn't believe how fragmented the industry is, how unconsolidated, how many players there were. Now its eight years later, I still cannot believe how fragmented this industry is. It's less fragmented than eight years ago, but compared to any other industry it's still a highly fragmented industry quite honestly. Just goes to one of the trade shows, Sitcom or Analytica that happened just a few months ago and you walk around and say my goodness how can all these company exist in one industry? So I believe that there will be further consolidation going forward. It just makes sense from an industry dynamics point of view.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "You are kind of expecting to see more kind of ABI and (inaudible) deals going forward?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know. I can't comment on exactly what would happen, but I would say in general some consolidation will continue I would think.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you so much. I will hop back into the queue.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann. Issac Please go ahead with your question. Could you press your mute button.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. I think, I was thinking the question. I think in the past month, you talked a little bit about having a couple quarters with visibility ahead of material economic slowdowns, and I know it is a very macro type of question, but I'm wondering, would you still say that's the case today and if so how do you feel about 2009 for your end markets in the industrial segment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, this is on a certain segment of our products and process instruments, where we provide instrumentation that goes into either capacity expansion of existing plants or new plants that are being built to basically do the in-line quality control of say a refinery or something like that, basically a chemical process. And I would say that we see no decline in terms of the next two quarters in that area. And we relate that to just still exceptionally high-commodity pricing. People have decided to expand their capacity, and they've decided that three months ago, and they are drawing up the plans, they begin to order this equipment.", "But the lead time on that is sometimes six months or so because they can only receive that equipment when they have made some good progress with building the plant. So we come in as a last moment sort of just before the plant gets started up. And that's why we have some visibility from a backlog point of view. But those decisions have been made already in the past. We just know that our sales will be there for the next few quarters in that particular area. And as I said, you know, this continues to be strong because commodity prices are high.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Sure, okay. Thanks. And then, just regarding the Asian marketplace. Could you qualify maybe a little bit how that growth is driven when you compare sort of new lab build outs versus maybe incremental share gains? And then secondly on that question, how would you characterize the nature of your product mix there, has that evolved in a meaningful way in the last two or three years?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll start with the last one first. Given the tremendous focus that we've had in the legacy thermo business on places like China, the mix in terms of scientific instruments and laboratory equipment is higher in those countries than laboratory consumables. Okay, now, that will gradually change. But right now, I would say the mix is richer in sort of the legacy thermo electron product line. And it is a very, very wide range of applications there in China.", "To begin with the obvious, environmental applications are very, very, key, the build out of life sciences laboratories, university laboratories, hospitals is key, and the third one, that's very strong right now, is anything that's related to food quality monitoring, with some of the hiccups that the Chinese exports have had in terms of food safety. So it's a wide range of applications. And I would just say that China is really strong across the border.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Banc of America.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. Pete, given the better working capital performance in the quarter what's keeping you from raising the cash outlook for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I should have expected that question from you, Jon.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Better than ten questions on the mid-single millions of inflation issue.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. It's basically I've given guidance of about $1.2 billion of cash flow for the year. If we're going to beat that number, it will be in the working capital area. But we do have a lot of headwind versus last year on taxes, that's we're just paying more cash taxes this year than we paid in 2007. So at this point the working capital metrics are better. But if you look at the cash usage on working capital it is actually up significantly versus last year.", "At this point, I'm not sure whether that's because of where the quarter ended, which this year we kind of got dinged both in Q1 and Q2, then the last calendar day was outside of our fiscal calendar. So if things go well in Q3 I will raise the number.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then, CapEx I mean you're running a bit below annualized guidance.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Are you still looking for 230 to 240?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's definitely going to be in that range, 250 I think is the guidance that I've given in the past.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then Marijn, back on the momentum in the top-20, can you give us or quantitate somewhat that growth profile. I mean is it in excess of 10% organically?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I want to be careful with that because it's such a small number of customers. So competitively I want to be careful with that. But if I say we have 8% organic growth. If I say that we are significantly outgrowing the average of the company I think you can conclude that it's higher than 10.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And where is... I mean where is that share coming from, are you consolidating more product to the channel, is it coming from other distributors, what's your sense of where that's coming from?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very broad based growth. First of all I think that those large customers want to consolidate their purchasing with fewer suppliers. We are obviously there with a very focused sales executive team at each of these customers to make them very aware of what Thermo Fisher can offer, help them make it easier to do business with us. So I think just our focus and our size is making them do more business with us. We go really the extra mile for these plenty of customers. So, that's one. And then I think there is also a number of programs that we have initiated around standardization at some customers where you say we can help you standardize your purchases. Have less fragmentation in the types of products you buy and that is also beginning to contribute.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sheng Chi Nem [ph] with JPMorgan.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Hi guys, sitting here Tycho today. Thanks for taking the question. First question is for your, going back to your top 20 accounts. Could you to the extent that you can breakout kind of the rough breakdown of the accounts by end markets in geography.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I will try. It is a typical suspect... the usual suspect, I guess. It is basically when you say large pharma, large Biotech are in there. And some of the larger reference labs. So, I would say probably 65% of that is in the US and 35% in Europe.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "And then could you also comment on your overall mass spec business, given kind of the new product line, to increasing product line to how done all those things competitively. If it is taking market share and also kind of comment on pricing?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean mass spec is, it continues to be a very good story for us. As I was mentioning in my comments we came out with again some exciting new... new platforms at ASMS, which we have had very good reaction to. Now, I think that in terms of share... I believe we are gaining share in this market. It is in the end hard to know because most competitors including us don't specifically comment on growth in mass spec, but from what we are seeing and what we are hearing and the feedback we get at the ASMS surveys, we believe that we are continuing to gain share.", "And have done so quite honestly for the last four to five years. I think from a pricing point of view this is not a price sensitive market in general with maybe a few exceptions in some certain industries or certain product lines. But in general life sciences researchers are very keen on having the best instrumentation and why do all the work if you then put your sample into mass spec, that doesn't give you the answers that are truly available today. So, there is a strong demand from the high end researchers to really want to have the best possible equipment. And that drives the replacement cycle that works in our favor.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. No more questions?", "Operator", "I'm not showing any questions.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. All right. Let me just make a quick closing comment. As you've heard, record performance in Q2, very strong first half. We believe as a result of that we are well positioned to meet our growth goals for the year. We continue to invest in new products and new markets that will contribute to our growth in the future. And want to thank you for your support for being on the call today and we look forward to reporting on our progress again after Q3. So again, thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Related information is also available on the investor section of our website under the heading webcast and presentation.", "So, with that I would now like to turn the call over to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. I know there are number of companies in our space are competing for your attention this morning. So, thank you very much for joining us. I think you will be glad you did because it was a very good quarter. As you saw in our press release, we had another record quarter in Q2 with strong performance in all of our key financial metrics. So, let me get right to the highlights.", "First, we had a really strong revenue growth quarter with a 14% increase to $2.7 billion. Adjusted EPS rose by 22% and our adjusted operating income increased 18%, and we also achieved 60 bases points of adjusted operating margin expansion, so a terrific growth quarter.", "I believe our success is the result of our sound business model. As you've heard me say before, we do not run this company quarter-by-quarter focused on any one single financial goal. Instead, we work to achieve a balance of our four key financial metrics, which are revenues, operating margin, EPS and cash flow. And we believe that this approach is the best way for us to generate growth that is sustainable and creates value for shareholders over the long-term.", "Our performance in Q2 puts us right where we expected to be halfway through the year and this positions us to meet our growth goals for the full year in 2008. Our results year-to-date also show that not only have we achieved our cost energy targets from the merger of Thermo Fisher, but we are right on track with revenue synergies in the three areas we have been focusing on since the merger.", "You remember that the three areas of revenue synergies were one selling more self-manufactured products through the Fisher Scientific catalogs. Two, leveraging the company's scale by growing faster in Asia and three focusing specifically on our top 20 largest accounts to gain share. We are very encouraged by our success in each of these three areas. The first one that we started seeing results from early last year was selling more self-manufactured products through our Fisher scientific catalogs and the success of this has significantly added to our margin expansion in the past six quarters.", "And then second, by leveraging our total company footprints, we have also seen faster than market rate revenue growth across Asia, not just in China but also in India and even in Japan. And Asia is now 13% of our total revenue versus 10% at the time of the merger, so an overall acceleration of growth in Asia of about $300 million in just over one year.", "And then lastly, in the past few quarters revenue growth of our top 20 customer counts has been significantly outperforming the company average indicating that our focus on these large customers is also beginning to pay off. So we are progressing well on all these three fronts as a result of being the combined Thermo Fisher Company.", "Now let me make a few comments about our key end markets. We are especially pleased with our performance given the current global economic environment. The newspaper headlines continue to point to how much uncertainty there is in the world. Again, we are not seeing any significant change from what we have reported to you so far this year.", "We saw particular strength and above average growth in our scientific instruments business, our specialty diagnostics business and our BioPharma Services business. From a market point of view, our major life sciences and healthcare end markets remained strong in general with particular strength and demand from CROs. Biotech demand for research products is also very robust but demand for bioprocessing products used in drug production continues to be weak.", "Our industrial markets are holding their own very nicely with high commodities pricing continuing to drive spending and investments by our customers. And then in Q2, sales in our much talked about safety catalog business were flat compared with last year and as a result did not create the headwind for us in organic growth that it did in earlier quarters.", "The impact of declines we have seen in this business should be less significant going forward.", "Again, I believe our size, breadth of portfolio especially our large percentage of consumables, and our global presence give us a key advantage. All of this makes us less vulnerable to market shifts. We also have the resources to continuously invest in the business to develop new technologies and penetrate new markets that allow us to capitalize some opportunities for growth.", "So let me spend a couple of minutes talking about a few of the new developments in our business that will contribute to our growth going forward. First, new products, those of you who attended ASMS, the leading conference on Mass Spectrometry, know that we had a very strong showing again this year.", "These instrument system are sold under our Thermo Scientific brand. The highlights included two break through systems that expand the use of high end analytical tools to more users and applications.", "Firstly, our new vantage is the latest addition to our successful line of Triple Quad Mass Spectrometry system delivering up to ten times more sensitivity for our Life Sciences customers who continue to demand more accurate analysis for their cutting edge protein research.", "Secondly, our new executive LCMS system on the other hand leverages our successful Orbitrap technology in a Benchtop system that is easy for non specialists to operate. It delivers the high resolution, sensitivity and mass accuracy needed to meet analytical challenges in a range of applications.", "So these new systems generated a lot of excitement at the conference and the feedback since then has been extremely positive. Customers are gaining hands-on experience with them in our demonstration labs around the world and these instruments have already started shipping in Q3.", "A quick word on acquisitions, we continue to augment our internal developments with acquisitions that offer complimentary technologies or greater access to new markets. You may recall last quarter, our Bio Sciences business launched our new excel Gene-Silencing Technology which extends the use of synthetic RNAi by making it possible to deliver these reagents into more types of cells.", "Well, this quarter we strengthened our leadership in RNAi with the acquisition of Open Biosystems. This business which has about $15 million in revenues adds a complimentary line RNAi technologies to our existing portfolio. We can now provide scientists with the post comprehensive RNAi tool kit to accelerate the discovery of new therapies in neuroscience, immunology, stem cell science and oncology.", "Just last week, our Bio Scientist business also acquired Affinity BioReagents, a small but leading provider of antibodies, peptides and proteins with revenues of $6 million. This acquisition give us new opportunities to create complete solutions for widely used research applications by combining an extensive BioReagents portfolio with our current Proteomics, 0:32, 5 offerings. We also acquired the analytical and environmental instrument businesses of Chemito to strengthen our presence in India. This is another in a series of investments we have made to expand our footprint in that growing market. And, I will ask Marc Casper, our COO, to say a few words about our activities in India. Marc?", "Marc N. Casper - Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer", "Thanks Marijn. We continue to make significant investments to strengthen our presence in India, a market we participated in with the direct presence since 2000 through our laboratory equipment and consumables business.", "We began to accelerate our expansion there in 2005 when we opened our state-of-the-art demonstration laboratory in Mumbai. Since then, we have been building our commercial organization, begun construction of a large clinical packaging facility in Ahmedabad and supplemented those activities with two acquisitions in Mumbai in the past year. This is all in an effort to serve the rapidly growing life sciences and industrial markets in that country.", "So what do we gain from these investments? We became the leading supplier of laboratory chemicals to research markets in India with our acquisition of Qualigence in September 2007. This business added about $25 million to our annual revenues. Our recent acquisition of two divisions of Chemito totaling approximately 10 million in annual revenues, gives us a strong position in India in Gas Chromatography and UV-Vis technologies. It is local manufacturing capabilities, and the deep sales and service presence. To me it not only allows us to better penetrate the growing analytical and environment instrument market in India, but should allow us to offer these low-cost instruments in other emerging markets.", "Last, our new clinical packaging facility is on track to open in Q4, the result of a $17 million capital program we initiated last year. When completed this 150,000 square foot facility will help us to meet growing demand for biopharma logistics outsourcing services, in response to the increasing number of clinical trial patients in India. These ongoing investments that we have made at Thermo Fisher, really positions us as the leading life sciences company in India by far.", "Once the clinical packaging facility is open, we'll have more than 20 facilities and offices, and roughly 625 employees across the country, putting us in an excellent position to capitalize on India's future growth. We're already seeing the return on our investments there. Year-to-date we've grown more than 40% over 2007 not including acquisitions, with a run rate for the year of approximately $125 million in revenue.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Marijn Dekkers.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Marc. Indeed, a very exciting market for with excellent growth prospects. So let me wrap it up by reviewing our guidance for 2008.", "After completing a strong first half, we remain confident in the full year guidance we gave you last quarter. We are maintaining our revenue estimate of $10.6 billion to $10.7 billion for 2008, which would lead to 9% to 10% growth over our 2007 results. And then based on our adjusted EPS performance to date we are increasing the low end of our guidance by $0.4 to a range of $3.11 to $317 for the full year. And this would lead to 17% to 20% adjusted EPS growth over 2007.", "So with that I am going to turn the call over to our CFO, Peter Wilver, for his financial review. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marijn. Good morning, everyone. As Marijn said, we had another record quarter with 22% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.79 compared to $0.65 in Q2 last year. GAAP earnings per share in Q2 were $0.57 up from $0.37 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of improved operating performance and favorable discontinued operations. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS.", "Revenues in Q2 increased 14% year-over-year to $2.71 billion. Organic growth was 8% excluding the favorable currency translation of 4% and acquisitions net of divestures of 2%. Organic revenue growth in the quarter particularly in our consumable businesses was enhanced by one day or close to 1% as a result of a shift in the Easter holiday to Q1, as we described on last quarters call.", "Going forward, Q3 will have the same number of days as last year and Q4 will have two more days. Bookings were in line with revenues in the quarter. In the Analytical Technology Segment Q2 revenues rose 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. In the quarter we saw strong organic growth across our life sciences and health care markets. Our industrial markets grew at below the average, but at a pace consistent with the past few quarters.", "New products continue to be a growth driver specifically in our scientific instruments, environmental instruments, molecular diagnostics and life science research product lines. In the laboratory products and services segment, Q2 revenues also increased 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. Notables in the quarter were our biopharma logistics services business which delivered mid-teens organic growth and our safety catalogue business which was flat year-over-year.", "By geography, we saw a strong organic growth across all our major regions with the exception of Europe which grew in the low-single digits, again strong growth than the year ago quarter. North America grew at slightly below the company average and Asia Pacific grew in the mid-20s. The rest of the world grew at around 35% albeit from a relatively small base. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 18% year-over-year to $477 million. Adjusted operating margin up from 17.6% up 60 basis points from 17% n the year ago quarter.", "The margin expansion was driven by pull through on our incremental organic revenues including increased prices, integration synergies and global sourcing and productivity initiatives. This expansion was partially offset by increased inflationary pressure in raw materials and transportation costs, slightly unfavorable business mix and 20 basis points of dilution from higher stock-compensation expense.", "Analytical Technologies Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 21% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 21.1% up 130 basis points versus 19.8% last year. Laboratory products and services Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 14% and adjusted operating margin was flat with the prior year at 14%.", "Margin expansion in this segment was negatively impacted by direct material inflation, net of pricing increases, and unfavorable foreign exchange on our European manufacturing cost base. Adjusted gross margin was 41.3% in Q2 up 30 basis points from 41% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives.", "We are continuing to see increased inflationary pressure on our raw material costs, primarily in steel, raw resin and plastics. We're also experiencing higher fuel and freight costs, a large position of which we've been able to offset in the form of fuel surcharges and increased freight billings. Direct material inflation in the quarter negatively impacted gross margin by about 40 basis points, this inflation was offset by our global sourcing initiatives.", "However, we did not see the same level of margin expansion that we have seen in the past as a result of the higher inflation. We expect raw material inflation to remain a challenge for the remainder of 2008. And we put in place additional sourcing and pricing actions to offset the expected impact. However, the net result is likely to be somewhat dilutive to our gross margin rate.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.3% of revenue in Q2 down 30 basis points from 21.6% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage and integration synergies, partially offset by growth investments and higher stock-compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.4% in Q2 down 10 basis points from the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage. Adjusted net interest expense was $22 million in Q2 down $1 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of a reduction in our net debt and a slightly more favorable interest rate environment.", "Other income was a loss of $1 million down $3 million from the prior year, primarily as a result of currency translation losses on foreign entity cash, and a $1 million write-down related to our $9 million portfolio of auction rate securities.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 23.6% in line with our full year 2007 actual and 2008 forecast rates of 24%. The Q2 2008 adjusted tax rate was down 0.6% from the prior year, primarily as a result of the tax planning we implemented during 2007 and early 2008. Average diluted shares were 437 million for the quarter down 9 million from last year, reflecting the benefit of the share buyback program we initiated in Q3 2007 and completed last quarter.", "In terms of balance sheet performance, we ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments up $272 million from Q1, as our free cash flow and proceeds from stock-options were partially offset by cash used for acquisitions. Our total debt was $2.2 billion essentially flat with Q1. We had strong working capital performance in the quarter.", "Accounts receivable days sale outstanding was 53 days down one day from the prior year and down three days from Q1 and inventory days of supply was 72 days down four days from the prior year and down three days from Q1. Year-to-date Q2 cash flow from continuing operations was $590 million and after deducting net capital expenditures of $104 million free cash flow from continuing ops was $486 million.", "Moving on to our 2008 guidance, we are maintaining our previous revenue guidance of $10.6 to $10.7 billion, which represents 9% to 19% growth versus our 2007 actual revenue of $9.75billion. This guidance reflects current exchange rates, incremental revenues from our recently announced acquisitions, and a reduction of approximately $20 million related to the recent two-year extension of our health care catalog businesses contract with Inverness Biosite.", "The 2008 earnings impacts related to the Biosite product contract revenue reduction is less than $0.5. In 2009, we expect an incremental reduction of approximately $60 million in revenue related to this contract, for a total annualized reduction of approximately $80 million in revenue from our current run-rate. In terms of adjusted EPS, we are increasing the low ends of our guidance by $0.04, resulting in our current guidance of 3.11 to 3.17, which represents 17% to 20% versus the 265, we recorded in 2007.", "With that I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question and Answer", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Hey guys, Mike Dauchy [ph] here for Ross. He is another call, but congratulations on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Mike.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "I want to talk a little bit about some of the raw material stuff you mentioned, some of the sourcing initiatives you are taking. How quickly will those take shape and could you talk a little more about those versus the pricing impact you have and some of the offsets you're making?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, in terms of the sourcing initiatives, those are something that we have been working on since the beginning of Thermo Electron eight years ago. So, it is not anything new for us, but we are initiating some incremental actions to try to help offset some of the inflation that we are seeing. And as you mentioned, we are raising prices in some specific businesses to try to offset that. What we expect to see is, probably a slightly negative impact in Q3 in terms of the net of those actions and then in Q4, to essentially make it all backup in the quarter with maybe a little bit extra to offset what we missed in Q3. So in terms of dollars, we are talking in the single millions of dollars of hurt in Q3 and maybe a couple of million benefit net, when you get to Q4.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "That's what we saw, but just wanted to clarify. And then just talk a little bit more about the emerging markets. China has been a stronger market for you post Thermo Fisher merger and India is showing tremendous growth. Can you talk about a little more about any more of the emerging markets you are seeing pockets of growth and what are the next strong opportunities for you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, Mark this is Marijn. Obviously, China and India have been very good. Other areas are places like the Middle East. Quite a lot of investment going into new universities that are being built in Saudi Arabia, for instance, or just in general, you know, with supporting infrastructure with hospitals, universities, and then also petrochemical industries that is doing very well there. We are also seeing very good demand in countries that are particularly strong in mining, minerals. So, places like Australia, Chile, Russia who are booming right now from a materials point of view. We see strong demand for instrument systems that help them analyze, what it is that they are mining.", "Mike Dauchy - Deutsche Bank", "Great. Well, thanks again and congratulations again on a great quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Merrill Lynch.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the call.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Congratulations as was said. By all indications, it was a phenomenal, phenomenal quarter. I think one question people will have is probably, if anything that would put a little bit of a lid on a great quarter is the guidance that you gave. So, can you maybe just explain, are you seeing anything different in your and, is this kind of a cautious view just given, you said the headline news you read in the newspapers and not knowing what's going to happen in terms of the top-line that you're maintaining given the very good growth obviously this quarter and then maybe some of the margin things you've talked about on the bottom end. I'm just trying to better understand if you're expecting things to slow a little or if this is just kind of cautious given you want to be conservative?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Jon, I will take the question. So that from the 30,000 feet point of view, we did raise the bottom end of our EPS margin by $0.04 and being two quarters into the year, we feel comfortable about that. We raised our overall guidance range by $0.02 last quarter, so we are sitting in the middle of the year. We have had a very good first half. We are confident that we have a very good second half. But at the same time with the material, raw material pressure, our ability to pass on pricing increases, the overall uncertainty around the industrial economy, there is enough uncertainty in the world and therefore insubtleties [ph] around our P&L that we say, lets just stay where we are for now.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And how... can you just describe the process... there was a lot of concern going in about the rising cost of oil-based products. Can you maybe just describe, the lag of, how that works? For example, oil prices have fallen quite dramatically over the last little bit.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And so how that would kind of flow throughout a given year and how you have kind of prepared for it at the beginning of the year and where you are today?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The way it works is, these price increases work themselves through the system, very often relatively slowly. For instance, oil has been going up for quite awhile but it was only two or three months ago that, for instance, a company like Dow Chemical said, we just cannot take these increases any more and not really very aggressively try to pass them on. So, they came out with a 20% to 25% price increase across the board, I think it was three months ago. A month later another 20% to 25% price increase on certain plastics resin across the board. So, they reached a point where they said, okay, some contracts are expiring, we need to start passing this stuff on. And that's when we as resin buyers become affected by it pretty much sometimes six to nine months later because it gets held up with the plastic resins manufacturer, okay.", "So, these pricing systems work themselves through the system from one to the next, to the next supplier customer relationship. We are right now in the middle of the storm of getting these price increases from our suppliers and our job is to find ways to pass these increased costs on to our customers. And that also leads to some delay again, more with some customers than with others. But if we have contracts, we cannot just abruptly increase prices. So, it takes time and that's why oil now is suddenly going down by $20. Isn't going to rapidly reverse it.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. I didn't know, if as you see oil coming down if some of the price increases they have announced maybe don't stick because customers start saying, no, look, oils coming down. We have our own demand issues. I assume you are not, more a price taker in general on some of these resin-based products?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I think everybody understands how this works itself through the system. The increase in resin prices have been so well documented that all of our customers know that this is reality and it is not something that we are making up. This is really there. And that's also why sometimes having these price increases take hold, takes some time because customers want to be convinced that indeed you are as a supplier experiencing that cost pressure. I don't think there is any question.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Just relative to Q2 then of what you saw, and what you are expecting, Pete, as you were describing in Q3, it seems like you are impacted to some degree in Q2, but you were able to have start pretty good gross margin expansion. Do you expect a bigger impact in Q3 relative to Q2?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I think the impact will be slightly bigger in Q2, excuse me in Q3 than it was in Q2. But at the same time we have already initiated some mitigating actions. So, it's not going to be a dramatic change. Again, talking single digit millions probably, which on our revenue base is not a huge margin impact.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The thing to keep in mind though just, one of the comments I made about it being dilutive to our gross margin. If we get 10 million of price increases for raw materials, we pass it 100% to the customers, it doesn't affect our gross margin dollars, but it does dilute our rate because we basically get revenue at zero margin.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, it is not hurting our guidance in our earnings per share, but it affects the rate a little bit.", "Jonathan Groberg - Merrill Lynch", "And, then last question. You mentioned that the Biotech Manufacturing business, your Bioprocess business, you still expect that to recover some here in the second half?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that at some point, maybe not in the third quarter but certainly in the fourth quarter the comparisons are going to get easier, because then we will, this has been going on for two, maybe three quarters. So I think, in other quarter, probably relatively weak in Q3 and then Q4 should be better.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks Marijn. Congratulations, very outstanding quarter.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you Jon.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Hi guys this is Dennis for Derik.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Morning.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Morning. Just thinking about the use of cash. Obviously your, guidance assumes no share purchases, but you announced the buyback authorization in I believe last August. I was wondering whether you guys might be willing to comment on whether we could see something similar in terms of timing this year.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We don't really want to comment on our share purchase strategy. I can make a general comment on uses of cash. Our top priority for the use of cash is to do acquisition and you are seeing, we have been doing some smaller strategic acquisitions that are well positioned in terms of technology additions or access to markets like what Marc Casper was talking about with India. So that's the use of our cash and that's the preferred use of our cash, but we don't exclude other buyback programs. There is just not one ongoing right now.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, thank you. Looking at cash again, I know that you said that you had an interest expense reduction on the quarter, but it also looks like interest income came up by about 50%. I was wondering whether that's due to anything more than just simply cash in the bank?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, as I said there is a slightly more favorable interest rate environment, but it's primarily the incremental cash.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay thanks.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Good morning guys. This is actually Matt for Quintin. Congratulations on the quarter.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Matt.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Marijn just quickly, touching on some of the markets could you talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the academic market front?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, think that academic is, it's okay. It's not super robust. NIH is not really a fantastic number. It is sort of flattish as you know. But that's said, I think that we are in a good place in terms of getting a good portion of what NIH is spending because a lot of the spending goes to new life sciences applications, biomarkers, Proteomics, RNAi technology, stem cell research to some extent. And being, in those sort of hot spots right now helped us get us maybe more than a fair share of the NIH funding overall.", "And I have also made the comment in the past, something we don't really keep track of because it's so hard to keep track of it, but it plays definitely a role, is that there are a lot of charitable gifts, large charitable gifts to life sciences research, healthcare research, universities, new laboratories that are being built with significant money donated by wealthy people that fuels the demand for laboratory equipment, laboratory instruments. And we don't really count it, but it is a really, sort of nice part of the academic growth story.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that color. Just moving back to Asian growth has been really nice here. Have you been able to kind of draw a line in terms of how the catalog release in China is favorably impacting that business here and kind of the early returns there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. The catalog that we came out with three months ago is not really impacting these phenomenal numbers at this point. It's way too early for that. I mean, we hope in the future that it will begin to contribute, but it has contributed a little bit in the second quarter but not in a meaningful way to affect these numbers. The catalog is pretty simple. Legacy Fisher had a very, very tiny position in China and in India from a catalog point of view. And we have aggressively, first in China gone out and put a catalog together in the Chinese language and we expect that over time we will start gaining share there in a market that is about, we estimate $800 million on laboratory consumables at the moment just in China.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thank you for that and congratulations again.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning. I wonder if you could talk about the turns in the pharma at the moment with the kind of weak Biotech funding market and cutbacks in spending that are affecting you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Peter, could you repeat the question, please.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "I wonder, if you could talk about the turn in the Pharma market with a weak Biotech funding and cutbacks in spending? How has that been affecting you?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "We have not really seen weakness in Biotech spending other than what I was commenting on in Biotech processing for the production of drugs. But from an R&D demand point of view of view it has been very robust. And pharma, I was mentioning we are growing significantly with our top 20 customers. A lot of them are obviously large pharma and we are doing very well on average with large pharma customers. We believe that we are gaining share with those customers. So we may be seeing some conservativism with large pharma in very high ticket capital good items in Q2, but other than that, pharma demands have been very good.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "What's the M&A environment like, and what do you think the likelihood is of further consolidation in the Life Sciences spaces going to be going forward and what kind of impact, I'm thinking about coming from ABI and (inaudible) Bill.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think... and I have always said this... when I joined this industry eight years ago, I couldn't believe how fragmented the industry is, how unconsolidated, how many players there were. Now its eight years later, I still cannot believe how fragmented this industry is. It's less fragmented than eight years ago, but compared to any other industry it's still a highly fragmented industry quite honestly. Just goes to one of the trade shows, Sitcom or Analytica that happened just a few months ago and you walk around and say my goodness how can all these company exist in one industry? So I believe that there will be further consolidation going forward. It just makes sense from an industry dynamics point of view.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "You are kind of expecting to see more kind of ABI and (inaudible) deals going forward?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know. I can't comment on exactly what would happen, but I would say in general some consolidation will continue I would think.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you so much. I will hop back into the queue.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann. Issac Please go ahead with your question. Could you press your mute button.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Yeah. Thanks for reminding me. I think, I was thinking the question. I think in the past month, you talked a little bit about having a couple quarters with visibility ahead of material economic slowdowns, and I know it is a very macro type of question, but I'm wondering, would you still say that's the case today and if so how do you feel about 2009 for your end markets in the industrial segment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, this is on a certain segment of our products and process instruments, where we provide instrumentation that goes into either capacity expansion of existing plants or new plants that are being built to basically do the in-line quality control of say a refinery or something like that, basically a chemical process. And I would say that we see no decline in terms of the next two quarters in that area. And we relate that to just still exceptionally high-commodity pricing. People have decided to expand their capacity, and they've decided that three months ago, and they are drawing up the plans, they begin to order this equipment.", "But the lead time on that is sometimes six months or so because they can only receive that equipment when they have made some good progress with building the plant. So we come in as a last moment sort of just before the plant gets started up. And that's why we have some visibility from a backlog point of view. But those decisions have been made already in the past. We just know that our sales will be there for the next few quarters in that particular area. And as I said, you know, this continues to be strong because commodity prices are high.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Sure, okay. Thanks. And then, just regarding the Asian marketplace. Could you qualify maybe a little bit how that growth is driven when you compare sort of new lab build outs versus maybe incremental share gains? And then secondly on that question, how would you characterize the nature of your product mix there, has that evolved in a meaningful way in the last two or three years?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I'll start with the last one first. Given the tremendous focus that we've had in the legacy thermo business on places like China, the mix in terms of scientific instruments and laboratory equipment is higher in those countries than laboratory consumables. Okay, now, that will gradually change. But right now, I would say the mix is richer in sort of the legacy thermo electron product line. And it is a very, very wide range of applications there in China.", "To begin with the obvious, environmental applications are very, very, key, the build out of life sciences laboratories, university laboratories, hospitals is key, and the third one, that's very strong right now, is anything that's related to food quality monitoring, with some of the hiccups that the Chinese exports have had in terms of food safety. So it's a wide range of applications. And I would just say that China is really strong across the border.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Banc of America.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Thank you. Pete, given the better working capital performance in the quarter what's keeping you from raising the cash outlook for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I should have expected that question from you, Jon.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Better than ten questions on the mid-single millions of inflation issue.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. It's basically I've given guidance of about $1.2 billion of cash flow for the year. If we're going to beat that number, it will be in the working capital area. But we do have a lot of headwind versus last year on taxes, that's we're just paying more cash taxes this year than we paid in 2007. So at this point the working capital metrics are better. But if you look at the cash usage on working capital it is actually up significantly versus last year.", "At this point, I'm not sure whether that's because of where the quarter ended, which this year we kind of got dinged both in Q1 and Q2, then the last calendar day was outside of our fiscal calendar. So if things go well in Q3 I will raise the number.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then, CapEx I mean you're running a bit below annualized guidance.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Are you still looking for 230 to 240?", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yes, it's definitely going to be in that range, 250 I think is the guidance that I've given in the past.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And then Marijn, back on the momentum in the top-20, can you give us or quantitate somewhat that growth profile. I mean is it in excess of 10% organically?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I want to be careful with that because it's such a small number of customers. So competitively I want to be careful with that. But if I say we have 8% organic growth. If I say that we are significantly outgrowing the average of the company I think you can conclude that it's higher than 10.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. And where is... I mean where is that share coming from, are you consolidating more product to the channel, is it coming from other distributors, what's your sense of where that's coming from?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "I think it's a very broad based growth. First of all I think that those large customers want to consolidate their purchasing with fewer suppliers. We are obviously there with a very focused sales executive team at each of these customers to make them very aware of what Thermo Fisher can offer, help them make it easier to do business with us. So I think just our focus and our size is making them do more business with us. We go really the extra mile for these plenty of customers. So, that's one. And then I think there is also a number of programs that we have initiated around standardization at some customers where you say we can help you standardize your purchases. Have less fragmentation in the types of products you buy and that is also beginning to contribute.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America Securities", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sheng Chi Nem [ph] with JPMorgan.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Hi guys, sitting here Tycho today. Thanks for taking the question. First question is for your, going back to your top 20 accounts. Could you to the extent that you can breakout kind of the rough breakdown of the accounts by end markets in geography.", "Peter M. Wilver - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I will try. It is a typical suspect... the usual suspect, I guess. It is basically when you say large pharma, large Biotech are in there. And some of the larger reference labs. So, I would say probably 65% of that is in the US and 35% in Europe.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "And then could you also comment on your overall mass spec business, given kind of the new product line, to increasing product line to how done all those things competitively. If it is taking market share and also kind of comment on pricing?", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, I mean mass spec is, it continues to be a very good story for us. As I was mentioning in my comments we came out with again some exciting new... new platforms at ASMS, which we have had very good reaction to. Now, I think that in terms of share... I believe we are gaining share in this market. It is in the end hard to know because most competitors including us don't specifically comment on growth in mass spec, but from what we are seeing and what we are hearing and the feedback we get at the ASMS surveys, we believe that we are continuing to gain share.", "And have done so quite honestly for the last four to five years. I think from a pricing point of view this is not a price sensitive market in general with maybe a few exceptions in some certain industries or certain product lines. But in general life sciences researchers are very keen on having the best instrumentation and why do all the work if you then put your sample into mass spec, that doesn't give you the answers that are truly available today. So, there is a strong demand from the high end researchers to really want to have the best possible equipment. And that drives the replacement cycle that works in our favor.", "Sheng Chi Nem - JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. No more questions?", "Operator", "I'm not showing any questions.", "Marijn E. Dekkers - President and Chief Executive Officer", "Okay. All right. Let me just make a quick closing comment. As you've heard, record performance in Q2, very strong first half. We believe as a result of that we are well positioned to meet our growth goals for the year. We continue to invest in new products and new markets that will contribute to our growth in the future. And want to thank you for your support for being on the call today and we look forward to reporting on our progress again after Q3. So again, thank you for listening.", "Operator", "Thank you.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call today, we have Marijn Dekkers, our President and Chief Executive Officer; Marc Casper, our Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; Pete Wilver, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website, thermofisher.com, until March 6, 2009. To reach the replay of the call on our website, click on Investors then Webcasts & Presentations. Please also be aware that a copy of the press release of our fourth quarter 2008 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section on our website, under the heading Financial Results.", "Let me now briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 27, 2008, under the caption risk factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change and, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements is representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2008 earnings and future expectations. And also in the investor section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading financial results. ", "With that I would now like to turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Thanks Ken. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us for a review of our 2008 results and our outlook for 2009. I don\u2019t have to tell you that the past year was indeed unprecedented in terms of the volatility in the global economy. With a fairly typical start and then as you know the world changed in September.", "In spite of the dramatic downturn, I am pleased to report that we delivered on our financial goals for the quarter and the year. Even coming in towards the high end of our adjusted EPS guidance for 2008. I can tell you how proud I am of the intensity demonstrated by our employees all over the world in achieving these results. This tremendous effort resulted in very solid Q4 performance and contributed to our strong results overall for 2008. On behalf of our entire team let me take a quick victory lap and get right through the financial highlights.", "First on the fourth quarter. Our revenues increased 1% for the fourth quarter record of $2.65 billion with 4% organic growth. Adjusted EPS rose 16% in the quarter, and we also reported significant adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter with a 140 basis points of improvement over the previous year. We are very pleased with the top line growth we were able to achieve in Q4 coming in at the high end of our guidance. In spite of the pressures on capital spending in some end markets. We also leveraged our performance to generate excellent margin expansion and adjusted EPS growth.", "Now, as I've said on previous calls we run the company by focusing on four key financial metrics, and maintaining a balance between these four metrics. They are top line growth, operating margin, earnings per share, and free cash flow. And our strong finish in Q4 contributed to very solid results for the full year in each of these metrics. On the revenues, the revenues grew 8% to a record 10.5 billion. So, we have now passed the $10 billion mark, an incredible milestone for us.", "In addition, we estimated that organic growth would be in the mid-single digits for the year and indeed we came in right at 5%. We also expanded adjusted operating margin by a 100 basis points for the year. This led to a significant increase in our adjusted EPS with 19% growth. In addition, we strengthened our balance sheet and generated 1.2 billion of free cash flow in 2008. So, we had very solid performance for the year, even compared with our strong results in 2007 pecked when life seem to be so much easier.", "Let me now spend a few minutes talking about what we are seeing in our markets today. Overall the economic uncertainty is particularly affecting capital spending budget. This is where our product mix is a key advantage. Two-thirds of our revenues come from recurring sales of consumables and services, while only one-third comes from higher price capital items such as instruments and equipment. The good news with Thermo Fisher is that, as you all know consumables and services typically hold better in the tough economy than higher price capital budget items. We\u2019re very fortunate to have built the portfolio that is rich with consumables and services. And then we feel that as a result, our revenues will withstand the test of these tough economic times better than most other companies.", "And as a side comment, I quite honestly feel that in recent months, the stock market has not given Thermo Fisher much credit for our more resilient product mix. From an end market perspective, we\u2019ve seen the following. Academic and government. Academic has been holding up quite well so far growing faster than the company average. While on the other hand, government growth has been slowing. The new federal stimulus package appears to be good news to us, but it's really a little too early to speculate about the direct impact of that on our business.", "Then on large pharma, we all know about the pressures on large pharma and their conservatism in spending has accelerated in the past few months. Many large pharma companies have announced additional cuts in their workforces and are tightening R&D spending and there is now also some consolidation going on. In spite of this, our revenues to large pharma in the fourth quarter are still growing faster than our company average. Our intense focus on meeting their needs in today\u2019s environment is clearly paying off.", "We believe we can deliver to these customers tremendous efficiency and productivity and the number show that they are becoming more and more receptive to our value proposition. Just as a side note, large pharma represent less than 10% of our revenues. So, our exposure to any one customer is relatively limited. Now, as far as CROs are concerned, they obviously are highly dependent on overall pharma spending and we have seen their orders particularly on the capital side weaken in the past months. In biotech, we are seeing a little bit of a mix picture, with large biotech continue to do very well, but biotech startup is becoming somewhat more conservative in their spending. On the healthcare side, where we are mostly in diagnostic testing, this market reportedly had been getting weaker. We are not really seeing it on the consumable side, where we are heavily weighted, but we see some of it in a slower demand for instrument. And then the industrial market this is really clearly the most problematic area at the moment.", "This is also the end market where we selling the highest proportion of capital budget items, particularly process instruments. Orders are extremely soft here pretty much across the board with the exception of food and beverage markets, which continue to do quite well. So, wrapping up the comments on these markets and preparing for the 2009 guidance, the key takeaway here is that obviously 2009 will be challenging.", "However, even though some of our end markets are clearly under pressure, we feel that as a company we are extremely well positioned to weather this economic storm for really three key reasons. First, we have a tremendously strong technology portfolio and as a result have the industry leading product and services offering. Second, the affected two-thirds of our revenue falls in the recurring revenue basket of consumables and services. And then third, the affected two-thirds of our customers are in the life sciences and healthcare industries, which are less cyclical in this kind of an environment, compared to the overall economy.", "For guidance, shifting through financial guidance here for 2009, as I stated at the beginning of my comments, these are unprecedented times and nobody knows exactly how the year will play out. Having said that, our estimates are based on what we know today and that includes a couple of key assumptions. With the ongoing economic uncertainty, capital budgets in some end markets primarily industrial will remain very tight especially through the first half of the year. And we also assume that foreign exchange rates will stay at today's level. So, that said we expect to achieve revenues of $10.0 billion to $10.3 billion in 2009, which would be a 2% to 5% decline from 2008 and takes into account the significant headwinds from FX.", "This performance would lead to an organic growth roughly in the range of about -2% to +2%. At this point, we are assuming that organic growth will be approximately flat and thus reflected in the midpoint of our guidance. If the economy gets stronger in the second half, we would expect to come in at the higher end of the range with low single-digit organic growth, if it gets worse we would expect to be in the negative low single-digit. We expect our adjusted EPS to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.30 for 2009 including the effect of the $0.03 accounting change for convertible debt. This would lead to a growth range of minus \u20134% to +5% over 2008, on an apples-to-apples basis. I would like to note here that we are assuming about $0.15 of adjusted EPS roughly 5% headwind in 2009 from unfavorable FX.", "So, without the FX headwind, we would be looking at positive adjusted EPS growth of between +1% and +10% for 2009. Now, on an ongoing basis, we continue to carefully monitor the market dynamics and how our businesses are being affected. We have plans in place that will allow us to respond depending on how the year unfolds. If the economy gets worse, we will implement our plans to further reduce cost, if it gets better, we may actually ramp up some investments.", "Either way the actions we will take will support our growth in the long-term something that\u2019s very important to us and position us to emerge from this period, an even stronger industry leader. Now, I would like to turn the call to our CFO, Pete Wilver for a more in-depth financial update. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks Marijn. Good morning everyone. As Marijn said we had a strong quarter in Q4, the 16% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to $0.88 compared with $0.76 last year. Full year adjusted EPS was $3.16, up 19% versus $2.65 last year and up a $0.01 from the high end of the original guidance of $3.05 to $3.15 that we gave at the beginning of 2008. A very good result given all the turmoil, we saw in the world economy towards the latter part of the year.", "GAAP earnings per share in Q4 were $0.68 up from $0.54 in the prior year's quarter primarily as a result of our improved operating performance. Our press release contains a detailed reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted EPS. Revenues in Q4 increased 1% year-over-year to $2.65 billion. Organic revenue growth in the quarter was 4% excluding unfavorable foreign currency translation of negative 4% and acquisitions net of divestitures of positive 1%.", "Organic growth in the quarter was favorably impacted by two days as a result of our fiscal calendar. Full year revenues were $10.50 billion for 8% growth over our 2007 revenues at $9.75 billion. Organic revenue growth for the full year was a solid 5% after excluding 1% favorable foreign currency translation and acquisitions net of divestitures of 2%. For the full year, we had one more day than in 2007 as a result of the leap year.", "Bookings were below revenues in the quarter by about 2% and were flat with revenues for the full year. In the Analytical Technologies segment Q4 revenue declined 1% on a reported basis and grew 3% organically. In the quarter, we saw softer demand from industrial markets than in previous quarters. New products continue to be a growth driver specifically in our scientific instruments and life science research product lines. For the full year, Analytical Technologies grew 7% on a reported basis and 4% organically.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 revenues increased 3% on a reported basis and 5% organically. During the quarter, we saw a strong growth in our research catalog, laboratory workstations, and biopharma logistics services businesses. For the full year, revenues in Laboratory Products and Services grew 9% on a reported basis and 6% organically. By geography, we saw a growth in all our regions except the rest of the world, which contracted in the low single digits.", "North America and Europe rebounded slightly from Q3 to grow at around the company average for the quarter. Asia growth slowed from previous quarters to slightly below the company average, but China growth remained strong offset by a decline in Japan. For the full year, North America and Europe grew below the company average, Asia-Pacific grew in the mid teens, and the rest of the world in the low 20s.", "Q4 adjusted operating income increased 9% year-over-year to 492 million. Adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, up a 140 basis points from 17.2% in the year ago quarter. The strong margin expansion was driven by pull through on our incremental organic revenues, including the favorable impact of our annual and mid-year pricing actions along with strict cost control and strong contribution from our global sourcing efforts.", "For the full year, adjusted operating margin expanded a 100 basis points to 17.8% as compared to 16.8% in the prior year. Analytical Technologies Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 6% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 22.4% up a 150 basis points versus 20.9% last year, primarily as a result of increased prices and substantial productivity improvements including global sourcing actions. For the full year, Analytical Technologies adjusted operating margin expanded a 170 basis points to 21.4%.", "Laboratory Products and Services Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 12% and adjusted operating margin was 14.7% up a 110 basis points versus 13.6% in the 2007 quarter. In Q4, our mid-year pricing actions almost fully offset inflation and we saw solid gains from our incremental productivity and cost actions. For the full year, Laboratory Products and Services adjusted operating margin expanded 40 basis points to 14.1%.", "Total company adjusted gross margin was 41.5% in Q4 up 60 basis points from 40.9% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of volume leverage including increased prices and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives. Inflationary pressure on our raw material cost continued in Q4 at about the same rate as Q3, although we did see lower inflation in raw resin. Also the rate of increase in our fuel and freight cost eased significantly during the quarter.", "For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.3% up 50 basis points from 40.8% in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A was 20.6% of revenue in Q4 down 70 basis points from 21.3% in the year ago quarter primarily as a result of volume leverage and cost controls partially offset by higher stock compensation expense. For the full year adjusted SG&A percent of revenue improved 40 basis points to 21.1%. R&D expense was 2.3% of revenue in Q4 flat with last year. For the full year R&D expense was also flat at 2.4%.", "Moving to below the line items. Q4 adjusted net interest expense improved 6 million year-over-year to $17 million primarily as a result of a reduction in our net debt. This was partially offset by a much less favorable interest rate environment. Other income was down $2 million from the prior year, which resulted primarily from a $1 million write-down of our investments and currency translation losses on foreign entity cash.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the full year was 23%, down slightly from our 23.3% full year estimate at the end of Q3, which resulted in a comparatively lower Q4 adjusted tax rate of 20.9%. The 2008 Q4 rate is down over 1.6% from the prior year primarily as a result of the tax planning that we implemented during the second half of 2007 and throughout 2008. The decrease of 0.3% from our previous full year forecast was driven primarily by an increase in our ability to utilize foreign tax credits and a shift in our international income to lower tax rate jurisdictions.", "Average diluted shares were $427 million for the quarter, down $14 million from $441 million last year. The lower share count reflects the benefit of our share buyback programs in 2007 and 2008 as well as lower convertible dilution resulting from the lower stock price. During the quarter, we spent $85 million to buyback $2.5 million shares, leaving $415 million remaining under our current $500 million authorization. For the full year, average diluted shares were $435 million, down $9 million from $444 million in 2007.", "In terms of the balance sheet, full year cash flow from operations from continuing operations was $1.42 billion, and after deducting net capital expenditures of $249 million, free cash flow from continuing operations was $1.17 billion. In the quarter, we spent $36 million on facility purchases as part of our footprint optimization efforts. We ended the year with $1.29 billion in cash and investments up 38 million from Q3 as our free cash flow was partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, debt repayments, and share repurchases. Our total debt was $2.06 billion, down a 124 million from Q3 primarily due to repayment of our 7 5/8 senior notes, which we do on October 30.", "Also Standard & Poor's announced on January 29, that it had raised its corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on Thermo Fisher to A- from BBB+, with a positive outlook. This is a notable confirmation of our strong balance sheet and liquidity position, in spite of the very uncertain economic environment. So, overall we are very comfortable with our liquidity position and ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future.", "Moving on to working capital, we had good performance in the quarter. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding was 50 days down four days from Q3 and flat with the prior year and inventory days of supply was 68 days down six days from Q3 and also flat with prior year.", "So, finally moving on to our future guidance. As Marijn said, we expect a difficult economic climate in 2009 for the capital equipment portion of our revenue, especially during the first half of the year, due to constrained capital budgets. However, our consumables and service businesses, which represent about two-thirds of our revenue should fair better in this environment as they are tied to activity rather than investment decisions. As a result, we are initiating a 2009 revenue guidance range of $10.0 to $10.3 billion, which represents a 2% to 5% decline, as compared to our 2008 reported revenues of $10.5 billion.", "This guidance assumes about 0.5% growth from past acquisitions and divestitures and no future acquisitions or divestitures. It also assumes present foreign currency exchange rates, which would negatively impact our revenue growth by about 4%. As you are probably aware foreign currency exchange rates have been extremely volatile in past few months and consistent with past practice we haven\u2019t attempted to forecast what will happen in the future.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we are initiating a 2009 guidance range of $3 to $3.30, which factors in a negative $0.15 per share or 5% impact from unfavorable foreign currency translation and a $0.03 reduction to reflect the impact of the new convertible debt accounting rule that will take effect in the first quarter. This guidance represents the growth range of negative 4% to positive 5% as compared to 2008 after applying a $0.03 reduction to 2008 for the new convertible debt accounting rule. And after adjusting for the 5% FX headwind on earnings, we are guiding to growth of positive 1% to positive 10%.", "Our adjusted EPS guidance assumes that we will complete the remaining $415 million of our current share buyback authorization during 2009 and that our tax rate will be in the range of 23% it does not include any other significant assumptions with regard to future acquisitions, share buybacks or other uses of capital. In response to our revenue outlook we implemented strict discretionary cost controls and some selective reductions in force in the fourth quarter, which enabled us to deliver strong financial results in year-over-year margin expansion in the quarter.", "We are planning to implement additional cost actions in 2009 where necessary to align our cost structure to a lower revenue base. These actions are included in our current guidance. We have also developed additional contingency actions that we will implement if required as we continue to monitor our revenue outlook in the coming months. That being said we\u2019ll generally take a longer-term view and avoid taking actions that we believe will damage the company\u2019s future growth prospects.", "With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "So, operator we\u2019ll take questions now.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Derik De Bruin with UBS. Go ahead please.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "", "Thank you. So, a couple of questions. When you kind of look at the organic revenue growth expectations that you got for like the consumable businesses, the instrument businesses, I mean if we, roughly 70% of your business being consumables, Fisher historically grew between 4 and 6% I would assume that your expectations for the consumable businesses is probably at the 4% range for this year?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Well, Derik. We don\u2019t really run the company that way as you know, in that sort of separation between consumer, consumables, and instruments, but if you want to go and do that analysis I think and Fisher typically was around 4% in bad economic times I think times are a little worse right now than they were in 2002 and 2003. I think at that time, we didn't see as many layoffs typically in our end markets that we are seeing right now. So, I would say consumables more 3% and 4%. Right now.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "And then I guess for along the same lines, for the stuff that's really kind of like heavy industrial equipment and the ones that are going into, much more economically exposed customers like, are you thinking down 5%, down 10% range?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Yeah. I think so again, the difference between the economic environment today and the economic environment in '01, '02, '03 is that we now also have just much less credit available, the overall banking crisis, we didn't have at that time, it was just a good healthy economic recession. And so, I think things are a little bit more severe then they were back then.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And then just one final question. So, I guess what's your assumptions for operating margins when you kind of look at 2009, are you thinking margin in flattish basically, is that's kind of what's implied in the guidance range?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "No, I mean, I think we still hope and we would be hitting the mid-point of our guidance say 0% organic growth, we still hope to be able to deliver some EBITDA margin expansion on that. And that's reflected in the guidance and translation to the EPS mid-point.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. So, then the lower range on the EPS is more to do with the potential volume pull through from the organic revenue growth being down or is it below the line?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Yeah, exactly. So, I mean, basically say $3 to $3.30 and you can roughly put a bracket on that, of -2% to +2% organic growth.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. Thanks a lot. I'll get in the queue.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank. Go ahead please.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. So, as you sort of look across your end markets, I mean it's definitely a more interesting time than we have seen in quite a long while, is there any sort of specific areas that you are closely monitoring, I mean obviously industrials, I think is well understood to be soft. Aside from that in the traditional life science markets where there is potential for either a significant delta versus where we are today, is there any sort of specific one that you are most concerned about or monitoring most closely, or do you think across sort of mostly life science markets its still relatively kind of somewhat predictable comparative to what we are seeing on the industrial side?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Well, I think that, good morning. I think that we've seen a really rough few months obviously with a lot of people being very, very, very nervous and with no questionable access to capital. And of course everybody slams on the break particularly from a capital budget point of view. Anybody who can postpone buying inexpensive instruments whether it\u2019s in a hospital or in large pharma or anybody who has the stock price that came down 40% on average is going to be careful in how they are going to spend money particularly if the bankers tell them that they can't borrow anything. So, that\u2019s what we have gone through, and I think actually that part of it is already getting a little bit better, money seems to start flowing a little bit easier again and that doesn\u2019t mean people are going to throw caution in the wind, but I do expect that to get better, in the end, you think about hospitals for instance. People are going to get sick, hospitals curtailing their spending on capital equipment is five maybe for a few months, but that\u2019s not a long-term option. And therefore, I think that that overtime it will get better, and we\u2019re hoping in the second half of the year the capital budget constraints will become less severe. I think the, a few things that I really can't explain is why CROs are so weak, because I think in the end pharma is not that cyclical from an economy and therefore CRO shouldn\u2019t be that cyclical from an economy point of view. So, I think there is some artificiality in the weakness of CROs right now, that I think will turn around relatively quickly, because in the end CROs are a great way to drive productivity for large pharmas. So, I think that market will recover very soon.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay. And as we think about the strategy of when you put these two businesses together in terms of Thermo and Fisher clearly, I talk about the one stop shop and the ability to capitalize longer-term on a consolidation of suppliers amongst your customer base. As they move this sort of more sophisticated [blotting] pads to what degree do you think kind of the economic strains that we\u2019re seeing right now could almost perversely sort of benefit you in that, people look down their supplier list and say maybe we don\u2019t need to be purchasing from 20 separate entities and specially with EPS under pressure across the board, every basis point of savings counts to what degree do you to think actually this sort of helps, kind of push your cost that I know has been kind of a top line synergy that's been talked about for sometime since the deal was accommodated?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Yeah. So, I think it's a very good point that you are making, I mean we have been able to drive these synergies obviously otherwise, we wouldn\u2019t be doing so well with large pharma in this environment. So, it has been working, but I think this just puts more fuel on the fire again in terms of big pharmas willingness to change the way they are doing business. And that is a very, very big struggle for a lot of CEOs who are running big pharma companies. Actually, I am the CEO myself it is a lot easier in this environment to drive change in a company than when everything is going nice and dandy. Because all you have to say is well the alternative is that, we may have to cut cost by laying off some people and very quickly people volunteer to reduce expenses or try to drive cost efficiency because the alternative is much less desirable through the whole organization and I think the same is going on in big pharma right now. If there is a choice between doing another 500 people layoff at big pharma or consolidating that by [bet] purchases with Thermo Fisher. I think it's a pretty simple equation.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. I appreciate the color Marijn. Thank you again.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Go ahead please.", "Sung Ji Nam \u2013 JPMorgan", "Hi. This is Sung Ji sitting in for Tycho. Thanks for taking the questions. Kind of in terms of your cost structure for 2009, you talked about adjusting it is necessary, could you give us more color as to what some of the specific levers are and particularly how that could impact R&D spending?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Yeah. We really don\u2019t think it will affect R&D spending. I mean as both Pete and I said we are very focused on the long-term, R&D we don\u2019t see as a discretionary expense, but as a very key component of our technology leadership. We are always cautious and very prudent with how much we spend and spending it on the right project, and we have a very disciplined mechanism for that in the company. But this is just not an area where we would go. There are still a lot of discretionary that's, in every company lot of discretionary spending going on, where at some point you can say well if the customer base is not going to be spending as much do we really now have to spend ourselves all this money, and some areas that qualify for that are exercising the aggressiveness with which you implement IT improvements, very important to have good IT systems to drive an efficient business model, but its also very expensive, we have been investing a lot in the area, we continue to grow our budget in that area, but the pace at which you do that is discretionary. So, depending on how the year unfolds, those would be areas where you'd say, maybe we will delay certain projects for half the year to make sure that the economy is on more solid footing, before we spend this extra money.", "Sung Ji Nam \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay, great. And as for your, would you provide more color on your FX hedging strategies, and if there is any strategies that could potentially offset some of the headwinds this year on both the top and the bottom lines?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yeah. In general, in the past we haven't hedged our foreign exchange exposure and we are not assuming that we are going to do that in 2009 either we. Basically, our foreign exchange gains and losses on the top line fall through to the bottom line and about the average, which means we are basically naturally hedged in terms of our cost structure. We could put, put hedges in place, but in the end that's a bet that the FX rates are going to go down or up. So, we are basically allowing it to flow through as it happens, its the hedging is really just the short-term strategy.", "Sung Ji Nam \u2013 JPMorgan", "Great. Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Quintin Lai with Baird. Go ahead please.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W Baird & Co", "Hi, good morning.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Good morning, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W Baird & Co", "Just first looking at your guidance, and in particular are you making any assumptions for the stimulus package in the potential passage and if not what's your view on any potential '09 impact, if passed?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Well as I said in my comments it's very hard to know exactly what's going to happen. First of all, the decisions haven\u2019t been made, but I do believe that we have not included this in our guidance, it would help us to get to the higher ends of our guidance obviously when this would really roll through. But anytime, anybody makes money available for new laboratories to be built is a very good thing for us and that when we are able to get in on the bottom floor like that, from all the way from the side of laboratory we usually walk away with a lot of the money that\u2019s available. So it\u2019s positive, but it's hard to quantify.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W Baird & Co", "", "Thank you for that. And then with respect to kind of the overall market, the sector for you. With the speed at which, the end markets are changing and that volatility there. What\u2019s your view on you and your competitors going forward, do you think that people, companies will kind of stick to their netting or do you think that there is still opportunity for sector consolidation from the suppliers?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Well Quintin, when I joined this industry nine years ago, I was amazed by how fragmented it is and I still in, in spite of some of the consolidations that have been happening that we\u2019ve been driving and some other companies have been driving it\u2019s still a very fragmented industry. And it goes back a lot to how the industry develops, a lot of the inventions are being done at universities, small companies generate from these universities. If the companies keep going, but in a more global environment and a more economically tough environment, I think the customers willingness to just by, from all of these different suppliers the new is gadget is diminishing. And so the customer is moving towards more consolidation in the purchasing and as a result the industry has to move along with it, but this industry with a few exceptions including ourselves has not been very proactive driving it. And, but its just a matter of time.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W Baird & Co", "So, do you think that, but I guess my question more is that with the end markets being as so uncertain as they are, do you think that that kind of puts a damper on consolidation in the near term or do you think that that really doesn't matter and people can kind of see to that for future deals?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "No, I think that, it depends on the motivation of the different companies, whether or not they, they would be sellers right now. And some people will say well, at this low of stock price why would I sell, some others could say well this is just as good a time as any other to become part of the stronger combined entity and that\u2019s a better option for our shareholders. So, it's hard to generalize you get different reactions from different people.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W Baird & Co", "", "Thank you. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital. Go ahead please.", "Anthony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. Good morning. Could you rank order for us given statements around completing the buyback, but rank order for us for cash uses in 2009. And second to that Pete do you have to pay down any of your existing debt in 2009 or would that be an option you would choose to do. And then finally is your CapEx for \u201909 going to change materially from that of \u201908? Thanks.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "I will take the first question.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yeah, go ahead.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "So, in terms of priority for the cash on the balance sheet I mean, Tony we have always I think been driving a prudent balance between doing smart acquisitions and using the cash for that and buybacks over the years and that's what we will continue to do. So, the good news is we have very, very strong cash flow, large cash flow given the size of our industry. And therefore, we think we will come out again with a balance of spending some of the money on acquisitions and some of it on buybacks.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So, in terms of the, your other questions, we don\u2019t have any debt pay downs required so nothing is coming due in 2009. And as far as whether I would choose it, I would just, I would have to say right now no, just because of, the uncertainty in the debt markets. I would have to see that, that loosening up a little bit before we would potentially choose to do something like that and we would have to be in that present value positive equation for us to do it. And then in terms of CapEx, it's about the same in 2009 as 2008 around $250 million.", "Anthony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks a lot.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann. Go ahead please. ", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. First off is sort of a big picture question on NIH funding. Just, hearing a wide range of scenarios as to what the budget increase might look like, they will sound pretty good and I am wondering if you guys have an opinion as to what you think budget increase might look like based on what you've heard and then, secondly when you look at that number, how do you think about the contribution of those dollars to products and services such as those that you sell versus maybe things that are more infrastructure related by jobs in the lab proposed or some things of that sort. I kind of wondered if you think it maybe $0.60 on the dollar from NIH might go directly into products or if you had an opinion there?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Yeah. Well we like it both, more jobs in the end is more consumables for us as well. So, when people build infrastructure, yes they need equipment and instruments, and goods and centrifuges, but if then they don\u2019t have enough money, if you put a lot of people with white coats in the labs and they won't consume. So, we really actually don't care whether it's jobs or infrastructure because we will benefit both ways. So, that's, that's one comment, I think, NIH has been very, very flat since 2003 after wonderful ramp up in the Clinton administration. And I think it's good to see its basically going back up, but if nothing else to, do some of the nut keeping up with inflation that we have seen on the NIH budget. And, but on the other hand we have some excellent years of growth with a flat NIH budget. Okay, so as a company it's not like we are super dependent on NIH being flat or going up, but we have such a diverse customer base that higher NIH is good it will offset some of the issues that philanthropic donations will be having right now, which often offset some of the flatness in NIH in the past. Philanthropy, will probably be going down, but it will be probably offset by higher NIH budget, net that's probably a positive for us in terms of spending available, but we shouldn't over interpret these things.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Right. Okay. And then secondly, just kind of interested on your comments relative to the CROs, are those based on what you're seeing here, right here at your labs or maybe among your pharma customer conversations or did both?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Yeah, I have always believed that CROs is a great way for pharma to drive efficiency, by basically eliminating their own capability in certain areas and leaving it to a more professional organization to do relatively routine work, at a lower cost and more efficiency, and that\u2019s not going away. If pharma is really looking for efficiency, they\u2019re going to need the CROs to help them drive that. So, this pullback in CRO activity is, I think going to be temporary. And what is that based on, really just common sense and of course my interactions with the industry.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "", "Right. And then lastly you saw on your consumable side for lab products and services. Do you think you did some market share in the fourth quarter and does your business plan call for any share gains in 2009?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "No, we always try to take market share of course. One of the things that has happened in that part of the industry is that we\u2019ve seen some very good price increases, over the past half year. So, that was a mid year, mid-year, August price increase as a results of the much lower or much higher input costs for raw materials than there was the regular annual price increase. So, the consumables have been helped with, the revenue numbers have been helped somewhat with price increases over the last six months.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "", "Thanks very much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jon Wood with Banc of America/Merrill Lynch. Go ahead please.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Okay. Thanks. Pete, can you give some parameters around operating cash flow in \u201909?", "Peter M. Wilver", "", "Jon, you would have disappointed me if you didn't ask question.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Can you expand it, it doesn\u2019t count?", "Peter M. Wilver", "", "Yeah, I think we\u2019re looking at a flat cash flow year-over-year, so about 1.2 billion, just the two big pluses and minus are, obviously in this environment we are going to be doing a little bit more spending on restructuring actions, and so some incremental cash expended there, and then a little bit better performance on the working capital side to offset that netting out to about flat.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. I know you guys don\u2019t typically do this, but can you just give us some parameters around the first quarter given all of the uncertainty out there I mean just basically would you expect EPS to be down in the first quarter year-over-year?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Well, you are right we typically don\u2019t do this. I think the one thing I would say is that Q1 is probably going to be the toughest quarter of the year. Okay, I mean that\u2019s not a big surprise and first of all because the comparisons are still relatively hard because, a year ago we weren't looking at this situation, and secondly I think we are right now right smack in the middle of the result of what we have seen in the last five months. This is a super conservative time for everybody, the beginning of the year, nobody knows what it will look like, and people are cautious, we are cautious ourselves in how we spend our money. So, when there is more visibility, and as I said also I mean the availability of capital loosening up I think that will make people feel better gradually throughout the year. And that will fuel some more confidence and then I think more activity in the economy.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Just in terms of our fiscal calendar as well we lose a day in Q1, a day in Q2 and then we make a backup in Q4. So, a net negative one day for the full year, so the first half is getting impacted by negative two days year-over-year.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and just.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "But, I think Jon the important takeaway here is that, I know you are interested in Q1, but we give guidance for the full year and we are very comfortable with the range that we have given for the full year and that's really what I think people should be focused on.", "Jon Wood - Banc of America/Merrill Lynch", "", "Sure. And just a last point Pete in your estimation what type of financing spreads can Thermo access right now in the current environment. I mean do you expect you will get any benefit from the A rating there or are spreads still unreasonable?", "Peter M. Wilver", "", "Well, I would not really want to be borrowing money right now I mean the numbers have just been popping all over place they change week-to-week by close to a 100 basis points some weeks. So, I certainly think the A- rating will help us, Moody's still sitting at Baa2 with us and, hopefully they reevaluate that position and get more with the fact with Fitch is at BBB+ right now. So, I think its certainly a positive and we will have to see it really comes down to when we go to borrow money what the spread it going to be but, it's ranged anywhere from 500 basis points up to the mid sixes in the last couple of months depending on the day.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver", "We lose the call.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Hello. Operator, next question.", "Operator", "", "Thank you.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Okay.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel. Go ahead please.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Peter, I wonder if you could give some breakout of how much it improves, what contributed to the 140 basis points improvement?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yeah. In terms of the 140 basis point improvement basically there is a couple of key drivers to that one is obviously pricing, and the pull through on that, we do our annual price role at the beginning of the year and then the mid-year pricing actions, the ones that really took hold in August and October kicked in Q4. As I mentioned we also had pretty strict cost controls in Q4 just because we were expecting a little bit softer revenue outlook so we've really clamped down on discretionary spending in Q4. And then we really ramped up on our global sourcing actions to try to offset some of the direct material inflation. So, those are really the three key drivers obviously we every quarter we\u2019re doing practical process improvements and other productivity actions, but those are really the three that were the difference.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "And what was the growth you saw of Asia and are you still investing in Asia?", "Peter M. Wilver", "", "Yeah. We\u2019re certainly still investing in Asia in terms of organic revenue growth that was slightly below the company average in the quarter and then the mid teens for the full year.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "And then I was just wondering if you could talk to some of the other levels you see for cost cutting in 2009 are there any salary freezers in place or higher increases in place at the moment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "No, no salary freezes, but we\u2019re cautious backfilling positions that come open, at the moment. I mean not, cautious means we don\u2019t just blankly replace every opening instantaneously with another person rather hire from the outside. So, we are careful, but we are not going crazy here in terms of staff reductions, we don\u2019t feel at this point that we have to. And the people who work here are here for a reason, which is contributing to the future prosperity of the company. So, we\u2019ve always run a relatively tight shift and we try to maintain as much continuity as we possibly can. We are fortunate given the mix of our products and the end markets we serve that we can take that approach in contrary to obviously some other companies at the moment outside of our space.", "Peter Lawson \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Operator, we\u2019re going to take just one more.", "Operator", "", "Thank you. Our final question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Go ahead please.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "", "Hi good morning and thanks for taking the questions.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Good morning.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "", "Clearly, it\u2019s an incredibly difficult environment and despite that you've generated 4% organic growth in the quarter I think that was even a little bit better than what you did in Q3 arguably against the tougher comp. This is despite the fact that as you acknowledge Q4 sales to industrials were already under pressure. Its sounds like you're picking up share in pharma, I don\u2019t want to sound it all na\u00efve to what\u2019s going on in the broader environment, but I\u2019m curious given how well you did in Q4, whether there was something very specific that you saw deteriorate right at the end of the quarter or may be in early January that gave you increased reason for pass heading into the year?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "No, I think it\u2019s a good question. No, it\u2019s not just revenue it\u2019s also orders, we saw probably 1.5% to 2% difference in terms of our order organic growth versus revenue. So, the backlog came down by a few percent. And we also have, I don't want to overplay it, but we had two extra days in the quarter, compared to the 2007 fourth quarter, which probably at 1.5% or so. Now, you never know because people have a budget they are going to spend it anyway whether they have two more or two less days. So, it\u2019s we shouldn't overanalyze this, but I think the 4% was very good, but I wouldn\u2019t go in and say, yeah we are going to do 4% for 2009 I think we have enough reason to believe right now starting the New Year that that things are tougher than 4% organic growth for us, particularly, in the beginning of the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay, that's helpful. And then instrument sales for regulated proposes, have they hold up a little bit better than placements for non-regulated proposes and has this provided some cushion in certain end markets specifically industrial, chemical where things are clearly better or weak?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "", "Yeah. I mean that's the beauty of pine of our customer base, it's a regulated customer base quality control, food. Food quality is doing very well particularly in China, as you know, where a lot of infrastructure is being put in place in laboratories to do better monitoring of the quality of food products that are being exported. And just in general anything that's related to environmental tends to hold up quite well, safety precaution tends to hold up well. Even if it's an industrial environment, because people cannot cut quarters on environmental and safety concerns.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "And any chance you would be willing to share what percentage of instruments sold to the industrial chemical end market are for safety purposes or regulated purposes?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Well, we don't even know.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Quite honestly. We have so many customers, and we don't keep particular track of that.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay. And last question, I apologies if I missed that I think you guys typically do get an annual 1% to 2% price increase, that you implement in early January. If I am correct, any challenges with that given the environment?", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "No, we've implemented it.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Okay.", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Again, on the consumable side usually these things are very much part of regular life and people understands why this needs to be done, just to keep up with inflation. On the larger ticket items, we have a list price, but there is often, a negotiation there, anyway its like when you buy a car versus toothpaste. You're not negotiating the price of toothpaste, but you are as a consumer negotiates the price of car now we see the same in our consumable versus instruments business.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen & Company", "Great. Thanks a lot for taking the questions.", "", "Marijn E. Dekkers", "Okay. Thank you. So, we have to wrap it up, thank you very much.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call Mr. Peter Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Mr. Wilver, you may begin the call.", "Peter Wilver", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. Also joining me on the call today are Marijn Dekkers, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Marc Casper, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website, thermofisher.com, until August 28, 2009. To reach the replay of the call on our website, click on Investors then Webcasts and Presentations.", "Please also be aware that a copy of the press release of our second quarter 2009 earnings and future expectations is available in the investors section of our website, under the heading Financial Results.", "Now let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements and as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2009, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available in the investors section of our website under the heading of SEC filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligations to do so even if our estimates change and therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2009, earnings and future expectations and also in the investors section of our website thermofisher.com under the heading Financial Results.", "With that I will turn the call over to Marijn.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Thanks Pete. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on the call today. We are now at the midpoint of the year and while we continue to face challenging conditions in a number of our end markets, we are seeing some positive momentum on several fronts, which I will cover this morning. This leads us to believe that the worst is behind us and that the rest of 2009 will show gradual improvement, helped by easier year-over-year comparisons in the second half.", "Let me start with an overview of our financial performance for the quarter. As you can see in our press release, the economic headwinds and the tough comparison with a strong Q2 last year hampered our growth in the quarter year-over-year. Revenues were down 8% and minus 5% organically.", "Adjusted EPS declined by 6%. Our adjusted operating income decreased by 12% for an operating margin of 16.8% in the quarter, or 80 basis points lower than Q2 a year ago. Free cash flow, on the other hand continued to show positive momentum setting another record with nearly $350 million generated in Q2.", "In the first half of the year we've generated a total of $660 million of free cash flow. So in spite of the economic pressures our business model allows us to generate a tremendous amount of cash.", "Another positive is that we were pleased to see that our operating performance significantly improved over Q1 of this year. This is the result of two key drivers.", "First, we saw improvement in sales of consumables. While it's clear that the economy is still causing our customers to continue to hold back on their spending for bigger-ticket capital items, like instrumentation and equipment, the inventory destocking activity we saw earlier in the year seems to be leveling off and sales of our consumables products got progressively better in the quarter.", "Second, we had a very good quarter in terms of ongoing productivity initiatives, namely our PPI, Practical Process Improvement programs and our global sourcing activity.", "In addition, we are now fully realizing the benefits of the various cost-cutting actions we began to implement at the end of 2008. All of this contributed to our improved profitability over Q1 and, of course, will benefit us going forward.", "I want to make the point here that while we are taking appropriate actions in response to market conditions, we are also looking to the future and we are making strategic investments that will allow us to emerge from this period an even stronger industry leader. As we shared with you at our analysts meeting in New York back in May, this is our number one priority.", "Now, let me spend a few minutes on what we are seeing in our primary end markets. For the most part, we haven't seen any dramatic shift compared with Q1, it's still a mixed bag. But at a high level, comments on biopharma, capital purchases are still slow, but we are encourage by good improvement overall in our top 20 accounts, which as you know are mostly large pharma customers.", "We had mid-single digit growth in these accounts -- revenue growth in Q2. So we're back to our trend of outpacing the growth of the overall company. It's still a mix. Sales are up in some accounts and down in others. The fact that six of these companies had just announced mergers may have had something to do with the lower level of activity we saw in Q1.", "Longer term, however, we still believe that big pharma consolidation will benefit Thermo Fisher, since we are in the best position to help these large global companies make their laboratory purchases more efficiently and more intelligently.", "On healthcare markets, back to my earlier comment about inventory correction, the destocking of consumables in hospitals and research laboratories seems to have leveled off and sales are gradually improving. The H1N1 flu virus has been good to us, with our microbiology and healthcare catalog businesses benefiting from sales of test kits in the quarter.", "On the industrial side, unfortunately, there is not much sign of improvement here. These markets remain especially difficult, and this is primarily affecting sales of our environmental and process instruments.", "Now on government and academia, we talked a bit about global government stimulus programs last quarter and how Thermo Fisher is positioned very well to benefit here. We have a significant commercial effort focused on capturing these opportunities, and there has been a lot of quoting activity, and some orders filtering in, particularly in our scientific instruments business.", "We believe that these stimulus programs will benefit us in a meaningful way in the range of $100 million to $200 million of revenue, over a 12-month period once these funds start to flow later in the year.", "As I mentioned earlier our positive momentum on free cash flow continued in Q2 with another good quarter, a record quarter and our balance sheet remains very strong. We are putting our balance sheet to work by deploying our capital in ways that we believe will create shareholder value, whether it's for technology development, strategic acquisitions, or stock buy-back.", "In the second quarter we did a combination of all three. First, our investment in developing innovative new technologies led to a number of key product launches under our Thermo Scientific brand that we highlighted at major industry events around the world.", "At ACHEMA in Frankfort, Germany, one of the largest laboratory process exhibitions in the world, we showcased a breath of solutions we offer for a range of application. From high-end instrumentation for life sciences research, to work flows for food and environmental testing, to elemental and analyzers for industrial processing.", "Then some of you attended the recent ASMS conference in Philadelphia, where we officially launched our next generation mass spectrometry system, the LTQ Velos ion trap and the LTQ Velos Orbitrap. These technologies leverage our history of breakthrough advances in mass spectrometry to address major needs of today's life sciences research particularly.", "One, their ongoing demand for improved sensitivity and speed of analysis; second, their ability to manage and interpret large volumes of data; and then third, their need for highly advanced tools that are much easier to use, which allows the sophisticated instruments to now be operated by customers with different levels of technical expertise.", "The new LTQ Velos platform delivers all of this. It was named the ASMS product of the show by the industry publication Instrument Business Outlook. We, and more importantly our customers, are very excited about the potential for these new products. It couldn't have come at a better time now that significant stimulus funds are becoming available for mass spectrometry systems.", "Secondly, during Q2 we also significantly extended our global commercial reach by acquiring Biolab, the leading laboratory supply channel in Australia and New Zealand, for approximately US$130 million.", "You can think of Biolab as the Fisher Scientific of Australia and New Zealand. It provides life sciences consumables, laboratory equipments and analytical instruments to research, environmental and healthcare markets in a part of the world where we had a significant opportunity to expand our presence. This is in line with our strategy of continued expansion of our Fisher Scientific customer channel in geographies where we believe we are underrepresented.", "Third, we spent $415 million during the quarter to repurchase our stock, completing the $500 million stock buy-back program, we initiated in September 2008.", "In summary, our strong balance sheet continues to give us a number of options for creating shareholder value in both the short and long-term.", "Guidance, let me wrap up my comments by reviewing our revised guidance for 2009. As you saw in our press release, we are raising our revenues and also raising the low end of our adjusted EPS guidance for the year.", "We are raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $9.80 billion to $10.10 billion, primarily due to a more favorable climate for foreign exchange at this point in the year, and our acquisition of Biolab. This new estimate would result in a 4% to 7% decline from our 2008 revenue results.", "We are also raising the low end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $2.85 to $3.10 for the year. This would lead to a decline of 1% to 9% from our 2008 adjusted EPS of $3.13.", "So, with that I will turn the call back over to our CFO, Pete Wilver for his detailed review of the financial. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks Marijn. Our operating performance improved significantly in the second quarter despite continuing difficult economic conditions that affected our year-over-year comparisons. Adjusted EPS in the second quarter declined by 6% to $0.74, compared to $0.79 last year. GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.49 down from $0.56 in the prior year's quarter.", "Moving on to the details of our financial results, revenues in Q2 decreased 8% year-over-year to $2.48 billion. Organic revenues declined 5% in the quarter excluding foreign currency translation of negative 4% and a 1% favorable benefit from acquisitions, net of divestitures.", "Consistent with my comments at our May analyst meeting, the Easter holiday lowered our growth in the quarter by about 1% and we had particularly tough comparison with 8% organic growth in Q2, 2008 compared to about 4% in the other quarters of 2008.", "Bookings were slightly below revenues in the quarter by less than 1%. In the analytical technology segment Q2 revenue declined 13% on a reported basis and 9% organically. In the quarter, we saw softer demand across the majority of our businesses, most significantly in instrumentation, and those serving industrial markets, which continue to be weak.", "On a positive note, we did have pockets of growth in specialty diagnostics and biosciences. Despite the overall decline new products continue to drive growth specifically in our scientific instruments, life science research and microbiology product lines.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment future revenues decreased 3% on a reported basis and 2% organically. During the quarter we saw modest growth in our research catalog and clinical trials services businesses, which was more than offset by weakness in other areas primarily in our laboratory equipment business.", "By geography, revenues declined organically across all our major regions with the exception of the rest of the world, which grew high single-digits from a relatively small base. North America declined at the company average and Europe declined a couple of points more than the company average. Asia-Pacific declined at about the company average against a very tough comparison of mid 20% growth last year.", "Q2 adjusted operating income decreased 12% year-over-year to $419 million. Adjusted operating margin was 16.8% down 80 basis points from 17.6% in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year margin contraction resulted primarily from pull through on the organic volume decline at marginal rates partially offset by a favorable pricing actions, strong cost controls, and infrastructure structure reduction actions, as well as our global sourcing efforts.", "Adjusted operating margin improved sequentially by a 130 basis points from Q1 as our cost reduction actions continue to take hold and revenues rebound somewhat from their low Q1 levels.", "Analytical Technologies, Q2 adjusted operating income decreased by 18% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 20.1% down a 100 basis points versus 21.1% last year. Laboratory Products and Services, Q2 adjusted operating income decreased by 6%, and adjusted operating margin was 13.6%, down 40 basis points versus 14% in the 2008 quarter.", "Both segments were affected by the factors mentioned for the whole company but the margin compression was more severe in Analytical Technologies, as a result of the steeper organic revenue decline and a higher rate of pull-through on lost revenues.", "Total company adjusted gross margin was 41% in Q2, down 30 basis points from 41.3% in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of lower volume, partially offset by increased prices and our sourcing and cost reduction initiatives. Specifically in the sourcing area, we've been able to claw back a lot of direct material inflation and are seeing a much lower negative impact than the past few quarters.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.9% of revenue in Q2, up 60 basis points from 21.3% in the year ago quarter as cost controls and cost reduction actions were more than offset by negative volume leverage and slightly higher stock compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.3% of revenue in Q2 down 10 basis points from last year. We intend to maintain our spending level in this area consistent with 2008 to ensure that we preserve our new product pipeline to drive future growth.", "During Q2 we continued our program of tight discretionary cost controls and have implemented further infrastructure cost reduction projects consistent with the plan we laid out at our May analyst meeting.", "As we commented last quarter, these actions are focused on the portions of our business that are most directly affected by the economic downturn or where we would like to reduce our manufacturing footprint. We continue to invest in our key growth areas to ensure we are positioned to emerge from the recession as an even stronger industry leader.", "Moving below the line, our Q2 adjusted net interest expense improved $2 million year-over-year to $25 million, primarily as a result of a $0.5 billion reduction in our net debt. This was almost entirely offset by a much less favorable interest rate environment. Other income was flat with last year at a loss of $1 million.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20%, flat with Q1 and down 3.5 points from Q2 2008. The lower tax rate resulted primarily from the tax planning that we implemented during the second half of 2008 and so far this year, along with overall lower pre-tax income, particularly in higher tax jurisdictions.", "During the quarter, we bought back 10.5 million shares and used up the remaining $415 million of our current $500 million buyback authorization. This brings the total amount we spend on buyback since the Fisher merger to $1.5 billion.", "Average diluted shares were 424 million in the quarter, down 13 million from last year. The lower share count reflects the benefit of our share buyback programs in 2008 and 2009, as well as lower convertible dilution resulting from the lower stock price.", "On a high note, our cash flow performance remains strong. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $735 million and year-to-date free cash flow from continuing operations was $659 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $75 million. Year-to-date free cash flow is up $173 million versus 2008 primarily as a result of favorable working capital performance.", "We ended the quarter with $1.4 million in cash and investments, down $143 million from Q1, as our record free cash flow in the quarter was more than offset by cash used for share repurchases and acquisitions.", "Our total debt was $2.03 billion essentially flat with Q1. We remained very comfortable with our liquidity position and ability to meet our financing needs for the foreseeable future.", "With regard to working capital, we had reasonably good performance in the quarter given the economic climate. Accounts receivable day sales outstanding was 53 days, flat with the prior year and down sequentially four days from Q1. And inventory days of supply was 73 days, up one day from the prior year and down five days sequentially from Q1.", "Now, moving onto our 2009 guidance; we are raising both the low and high end of our reported revenue guidance, from a range of $9.55 billion to $9.94 billion to a range of $9.80 billion to $10.10 billion, primarily as a result of improved foreign currency exchange rates and the addition of the Biolab acquisition. This range represents a decline of negative 4% to negative 7% compared to our 2008 reported revenues of $10.5 billion.", "Our guidance assumes present foreign currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our reported revenue growth guidance by about 3%. It also assumes about 1% net growth from past acquisitions and divestitures. Our revised reported revenue guidance translates to organic revenue decline in the range of negative 2% to negative 5%, which remains unchanged from our previous guidance.", "In terms of adjusted EPS, we are raising the low end of our guidance by $0.05 and maintaining the high end, resulting in a revised range of $2.85 to $3.10. This guidance represents a 1% to 9% decline compared to our 2008 adjusted EPS of $3.13.", "In interpreting our guidance range you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2009 playing out. Outcomes above and below the midpoint will be dependent upon the relative strength of the economic recovery in the second half and the magnitude of incremental stimulus revenues that we are able to convert by year-end. As always our guidance does not include any other significant assumptions with regard to potential future acquisitions, share buybacks or other usage of our capital.", "Although, we have had a tough first half in a difficult economy, and the world is still uncertain, we are beginning to see signs of positive momentum. We believe we are striking the right balance between aggressive cost reductions and strategic investments and as a result are well positioned to emerge from this period as an even stronger industry leader.", "With that I will turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Scientific management team, I would like to ask that you limit your time on the call to one or two questions. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue and pose your questions in turn. (Operator Instructions).", "Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "You know, coming out of the first quarter I think there were sort of three key investor concerns that hopefully were sort of addressed today, but I think to a degree that maybe you could sort of comment and give yourself a bit of a report card in terms of how you reacted to. One, part of some of the issues that we have seen over the last four quarters in terms of the global downturn and then some of the key investor concerns and maybe I'll list them and you can comment on each.", "And the first was sort of around consumable weakness, we have sort of seen that now bounce back so relative to sort of your initial expectations of how this business would perform in this market. Do you think this quarter was sort of more indicative of the trend?", "The second was on operating leverage; a lot was made of sort of the fact that maybe you didn't restructure enough and obviously with the leverage in this quarter; I'm curious to think, to see now if you think sort of the steps you took were proper.", "Then lastly, on capital deployment, you obviously bought back a lot of stock that was sort of a concern. Do you feel like the mix that you put forward this quarter again, sort of now positions you going forward, in sort of the way that probably best will serve shareholders versus some of the concerns heading out of Q1?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Good questions. Well, let me just give first a general comment and I think we made very clear during our analyst presentation back in May in New York, and also in the conference call after Q1, that our intention through this period is to come out of this recession as a stronger industry leader. And all the things that we've done since September of last year, when we were experiencing tougher times, have been with that in mind.", "So particularly on the cost-cutting side, we have been very, very careful to make sure that we are not losing the momentum that we have built up after the merger between Thermo and Fisher.", "I'll answer the second point first, in terms of operating leverage. We have driven significant productivity just in PPI and sourcing. We took a lot of cost measures, but in a very intelligent, I think balanced way. And we continue to look at our overall footprint and adjusting, you know the number of sides that we have down, because we have opportunities to consolidate.", "And the combination of that I think you saw, pretty much the full effect of those activities in the second quarter, while in the first quarter some of that was still ongoing, as it has been put in place in the fourth quarter, and into the first quarter.", "So there is more upside there, but we feel that, we've done the things that we needed to do to respond to the economy, and then also make sure that we come out of the economy stronger. So that's the operating leverage point.", "On the consumables weakness in Q1, we were actually a little bit surprised by the consumables weakness, because normally in a recession, yes, people slowdown their purchases, but consumables they may see a few percent of decline, but not to the extent that we saw it in Q1.", "What we weren't really prepared for was the combination of a recession and a credit crunch on top of it. And it was the credit crunch we believed that led to the destocking, people just trying to save, really, the last few dollars to make payroll for instance in a hospital.", "That destocking now, in the last couple of months seems to be easing up quite a lot, and, therefore I think, we are now getting into a situation where consumables are more like they would react in a regular recession, and the piece of it from a credit crunch point-of-view, I think is pretty much behind us. That's why I think we saw in Q2, already, consumables returning to positive organic growth.", "From a capital deployment point of view, we did some nice buybacks in Q2. Actually just looking here for the number in terms of what we've done since the merger \u2026", "Peter Wilver", "It's a 1.5 billion that we've spent.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes. So, since the merger, in November of 2006, we spent $1.5 billion on buyback and $900 million on acquisitions. So, that gives you an idea of how we have deployed capital in pretty much last two-and-a-half to three years, a $1.5 billion in buybacks and $900 million in acquisitions.", "Now acquisitions is still our priority, because we do believe as I have said many times that it's a very fragmented industry. As there are some great opportunities for us to acquire companies that are a very good fit in the portfolio and we're looking for them, but Biolab is an excellent example of how we're in a much stronger in that part of the world with a very, very nice channel. And we'll continue to look for those. So that's the priority, but at the same time if it makes sense to do buybacks, we will do so as well.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "Excellent, and just one clarification on the healthcare business, you sort of said that the stocking leveled off, and obviously you probably got some benefit from flu there, would you say now we probably go to restocking, or do you think we're in sort of a leveled-off period for some time?", "Marijn Dekkers", "I think at some point when people are getting less nervous about credits, we will get through some restocking.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "On the AT segment, it looks like that was a little bit worse sequentially. Can you just talk about, obviously you had a difficult comp there as well. But can you talk about kind of the easy outlook for the industrials business? And, we heard some companies talk more positively lately about China, just generally speaking from a macro perspective, what do you think about for that business?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I think anything that's related to industrial is still bouncing off the bottom, quite honestly. There hasn't been enough positive momentum there to say that that we are clearly seeing the end in sight.", "Since our Analytical Technologies segment has our instruments capabilities in it, so it sort of gets double-hit because the instruments are capital items, so that's tough. And then that's where most of our industrial exposure is as well, which is really in total only about 30% for the whole company, but most of that is in Analytical Technologies.", "So, I can't say that we have seen a tremendous up tick in -- we haven't seen an inflection point. Some businesses are beginning to see slightly better performance, but I can't say it's an inflection point.", "China has been doing well. We have positive organic growth in China, so China is one of the brighter spots in terms of the regional distribution.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. That's helpful. On the academic markets, I appreciate the color you provided last quarter on your view on stimulus. Has there been any change in kind of your sense of timing here and part of the question stems from the fact that we've seen some companies in the space talk about order delays ahead of grant disbursals.", "Then as an adjunct, are you seeing any interest in new lab space being built out, obviously with the workstations business, if you're a good proxy for kind of where the new demand is going to be built?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I mean its interesting comment Tycho about order delays ahead of new grants, because I definitely think that that has been going on the last two quarters. People might have even already gotten money from their own institutions to buy something, but they say, hey, before I do that, let me resubmit to see if I can get the money from the government, and then I will use the money from my own institution for something else later.", "So I think this extravaganza of putting proposals together has led to some order delay. But we believe that most of the stimulus will start to begin to come in Q4. And then obviously go through 2010.", "In terms of new lab space, it's not bad. It's, I would say, probably slightly better than what one would expect in an economy like this. And that's encouraging, particularly in Asia there is significant lab space being built.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "And then just one last one on pricing trends are the single-digit price increases kind of sustainable here longer-term? And as we think about obviously where pharma R&D budgets are going are you getting any push back on pricing from pharma at this point?", "Marijn Dekkers", "You know, you really have to differentiate right now between capital and expense budgets, and consumables that are typically paid by expense budgets, there really is not any significant price pressure there. We do as we always do at our annual price increases and that is expected by our customers and understood.", "We do see somewhat tougher price environment on the instrument side, because our customers want to get more bang for the buck there. Those are larger ticket items, and it illustrates how incredibly important technology differentiation is in instrumentation, because that gets you out of that discussion and that's why we're so focused on new product introductions, and making sure we have the best technology out there.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "First, just in terms of the H1N1 and kind of pandemic preparation, pretty decent performance here this last quarter. Have you been approached or has there been any talk about increasing inventory ahead of what could be a very strong flu season in Q3, Q4?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Approach by whom? By our customers?", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "By customers or maybe organizations like WHO?", "Marijn Dekkers", "By our customers, yes, but not by official government organizations, at least not that I'm aware of.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Then just kind of at a higher level, healthcare reforms has been talked about a lot here Marijn, of late, and there are different proposals out there. Assuming, that something does go through, and who knows what form it will be, but I guess, what are your long-term outlooks with respect to being a tool provider in a healthcare reform environment?", "Marijn Dekkers", "I think that my long-term vision on this is that we as a society will be under more pressure to deliver healthcare efficiently. And a big part of that is tailored trucks, so not sort of the big wonder trucks that everybody can take and maybe it has a good effect on some and not a good effect on others and we don't really understand the difference.", "But much more tailoring, much more understanding, much more companion diagnostics, much more knowledge upfront on whether or not a patient is going to react positively or negatively on a prescription, and that understanding has to do with science.", "Therefore I think, the days are over when we can just throw a lot of things against the wall and hoping that something sticks and call it a Blood Buster drug. I think we really have to in drug development and in diagnostics development be more refined in our approach, and that's exactly the sweet spot of Thermo Fisher, in helping our customers to be more refined, developing more in-depth capability knowledge, with our tools.", "So I think for us as an industry, if we can really partner up with our customers that way, it is actually an extremely positive trend, because we will get the waste out of the system that is in there right now.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thank you, and then just kind of the follow-up to that. Does that impact your kind of idea of M&A going forward, potentially more specialized diagnostics to fit that type of future?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, I would say yes. For instance, one area that I think will go out of favor or has gotten already out of favor, is all of the high throughput screening capabilities that we heard about five, six, seven years ago that were so popular, which was really focused on. As long as I do as many experiments as possible in the lab at any time, something good will come out of it. Trial and error, a lot of trial and error and I think those days are behind us.", "I think things will be done much more focused, and then to your point I think there will be much more convergence between life sciences tools and specialty diagnostics over time. There is no doubt in my mind that mass spectrometry will become a very important diagnostic tool in the future. And our internal development, our relationships that we have with key scientists outside of our company, and our M&A technology targets are all aligned with that vision.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from UBS. Please proceed.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "So, 3Q is always a bit of conundrum in life sciences space and that is seasonally a weaker quarter than Q2 or Q4. Now this year we've kind of got the added uncertainty of the overall end markets. I guess, could you just give us some commentary on your FX expectations for the rest of the year and I guess how should we kind of look about, the ramp from Q2 to Q3. Yes, you got [these] easier comps so I'm just wondering, Pete can you give us a little bit more guidance and color on how to look at those?", "Peter Wilver", "Well, basically you're asking me to give you a Q3 guidance, which we don't do. Essentially in terms of foreign exchange, we're assuming that rates stay about where they were on average in Q2. So, that obviously, that comparison gets easier in the prior year as you go through the year.", "In terms of the way we're looking at things, we would expect Q3 to still be seasonally similar to the way it was in the past. We don't expect a significant impact from stimulus or anything like that. That's going to come probably in Q4, if it comes meaningfully in 2009. So other than those two things, we're sort of assuming a normal year in terms of the comps.", "Certainly versus Q2, Q2 was against a very difficult comparison last year, basically all the other quarters of 2008 were 4%, and this quarter, we are comparing against an 8% quarter. So if you look at our organic growth for the first half, it averages to minus six to get to the midpoint of our range of minus two to minus five. You really need to be at a something about minus two in the second half. And that's what we're assuming is going to happen.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "That's fine. I just wanted a little bit of just direction to make sure I was thinking about it the right way. And I guess, could you, you still said that your industrial end markets were still feeling quite a bit of pressure. What's your best guess on when you could potentially see a meaningful rebound in those markets?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Quite honestly, I personally think, I'm not saying that it's, in our guidance, but I personally think that in the fourth quarter things will start picking up on that side. I mean, let's not forget the panic that broke out in the fourth quarter of last year, where people suddenly stopped buying commodities, they were starting to bring down inventories and certainly Q1 was very, very tough in that concept.", "I mean, in Q1, and at the end of Q4, I think half the chemical plants in the world were shutdown. So that's a pretty easy comparison. So I think we will see an uplift in demand in Q4 on the industrial side, but my goodness if I was sure of it, I probably wouldn't be CEO of this company, I would be doing something else.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. And one final question, it's like have you seen any changes in the biomanufacturing space its given the Roche Genentech consolidation, I guess and some of the other data points we've had recently from you know some product delays at Genzyme and some shutdowns there. Any comment on the manufacturing?", "Marijn Dekkers", "I think, it looked pretty, really stable, actually in Q2. So there weren't for us, not particularly wide swings.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Bank of America. Please proceed.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Pete, obligatory free cash flow question here, it's tracking a little bit better than your guidance. Any updated or thoughts there?", "Peter Wilver", "No, the guidance we gave at our May meeting was to be in a range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion were basically half of that through half of the year. Obviously, we're expecting our revenues to go up in the second half of the year, which will consume some working capital all things being equal. So I think we're still in that $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion range.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, understood. And then Marijn, from your comments, it sounds like the sequential improvement in the top 20 account base would have basically driven the entire up tick in the organic revenue trend from 1Q to 2Q. Yet it seems like the healthcare catalog got quite a bit better as well. So, what am I missing, did any product line or business get worse sequentially?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well. Yes, sure. Sequentially, not by much no, maybe here and there a pocket, but you can think of the top 20 as a segment, right? Because, they buy pretty much across the Board from us.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "All right.", "Marijn Dekkers", "So it's a customer group, it's just another slice of the pie, in a different dimension, but these customers buy everything from us, from the simplest [glass slide] to a mass spectrometer. So it's pretty consistent. Really the big difference, Jon, between Q1 and Q2 was that consumables got more robust, and that was pretty much true across the board of our consumables, but probably most pronounced in sort of healthcare-oriented consumables.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Understood. So, did the consumables growth build sequentially each month of the quarter, meaning like was June the strongest there?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, April was still weak. April, the whole quarter, if you would have asked me at the end of April, how does it look? I would have said it looks a lot like Q1. But once we were already mid-May in our analysts meeting in New York, we had a few weeks of clearly improvement on the consumables side behind us. That's why I made that comment there and that continued for the rest of the quarter. But April was nothing to write home about.", "Jon Wood - Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, understood. And one last one. Just on the general comment on the M&A environment. Has it changed at all from your perspective either in terms of the size or number of opportunities you are looking at?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it's hard to sort of define it as now it's getting better or now it's getting worse. But I think what's helping now is that people are beginning to realize that, okay, we had a significant retraction in values of the company, and everybody was going to weight that out to some extent. But now that markets have been stabilizing and it's clear that we're not going to jump back to [$14,000] any time soon.", "I think companies are now probably becoming more open. If they had planned to be acquired anyway to say maybe this is not such a terrible time to do it. So who is going to sell at the absolute low point? Pretty much nobody. But now that things are stabilizing and valuations are stabilizing, people will say this is maybe not a bad time to begin to consider this.", "So in that sense there will be more opportunities, in the next 6 to 12 months than there were in the last six months.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie Research. Please proceed.", "Jon Groberg -- Macquarie Research", "Just two questions; the first Pete it looks like, you are going to be about basically no net debt by the end of the year. And I didn't hear any reauthorization for a buy back. Is that something we should look forward to or are you assuming no buy-backs for the rest of the year?", "Peter Wilver", "", "Certainly we don't have any buy-backs assumed in our guidance for the rest of the year and we don't really talk about future authorizations, but you're correct, we do not have a new authorization in place.", "Jon Groberg -- Macquarie Research", "And then Marijn in the last quarter you helped walk us through this, and I haven't heard this exactly. When you think of instruments versus consumables and then kind of segment those, even a little bit further in terms of some of your higher end instruments versus your more routine instruments and same on the consumables, the more specialty reagents versus more routine. Can you break out how those went in the quarter, with a bit more granularity in terms of declines or rises?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes. Let me start on the instrument side. Actually it wasn't so much a high versus a low end, but it was more application-related, which is that, if the application was more industrially oriented, and it was weaker than if it was life sciences oriented. And I would say the only exception to that was food safety, which is obviously in my mind an industrial application that was doing quite well. But life sciences and clinical applications of instruments clearly stronger than industrial applications of instruments, with the exception of food quality.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And overall instrument I think in the first quarter you said were kind of down close to double-digits. Is that still the same case in this quarter?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yeah, same thing, yeah. On the consumables it's clear that the higher-end consumables are doing better than the lower end consumables. That was the case in Q1, and also still in Q2, because people tend to de-stock on the lower end consumables. Because they will more quickly de-stock on a glass slide, box of glass slides than on some high-end reagents that are really critical to their application that they're working on in the lab, say, in research.", "So it's a natural thing, the more routine it is, the more you say, okay, I can probably get this relatively quickly when I really run out of it, anyway. While a high science reagent might have a longer lead time and be more specific to your test, or its harder to go to the lab next door and see if they still have the product lying around there, so that you can borrow it. So lower end consumable's tougher than higher-end consumables.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And if you do the math for overall consumables, given what you said on instruments, kind of flattish then?", "Marijn Dekkers", "No, it was positive. We had some positive organic growth on low single-digits, but it was positive on the total consumable side.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, from Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "I just had a thought on, or a question on how you look at gaining market share in this environment from two perspectives. On the one hand in Big Pharma it does seems like integration planning for the announced deals is perhaps progressing a bit faster than in previous merger. So I'm wondering are you already getting signs that you'll be a bigger vendor for the combined entities or is it perhaps too early.", "And then secondly in the academic channel it does seems like a lot of this stimulus quotes and grant activity have been driven by demands specifically for existing products. And I know several of your competitors have new products that probably don't hit till the second half. So I'm wondering if there is an opportunity for you to also gain share in the academic channel when the first wave of stimulus money [hits].", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes. Good questions. From a Big Pharma market share point of view we have been gaining share there for the last three years. And as I mentioned, we've outgrown the average growth of the company, with those top 20 accounts for, nine out of the last 10 quarters, with the exception of Q1.", "So we are obviously taking the second very seriously, large pharma, because we think we have such a specific capability that they need really a very strong value proposition. And needless to say that when some of these customers are merging, we're right in front of them, explaining over and over again what our value proposition is; so we're hard on that.", "On the academic side, we came out, as I mentioned, with two excellent new platforms at ASMS in Mass Spectrometry, and I did say in my comments, it couldn't have come at a better time, because we are ready to ship these products now and we are getting a lot of quoting done, which is very positive, and from a timing point of view, works out very well for us.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Okay. And then if you think about how you look at driving incremental margin improvement, does it make sense to maybe try and drive more of your business away from the distribution of other vendors' product and if so, how do you achieve that most efficiently? Is it through the acquisition of some of your vendors, or do you maybe replace them with your own internal development efforts?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, it's obvious that if we are able to sell a product that we manufacture ourselves, our margins are higher than when we get that product from a third party supplier. So that's clear. And where we have a possibility and some controlled way, we may promote that to some extent.", "On the other hand, we are also providing our customers with choice. We carry in the catalogs of every product, three to four different brands, and most of them are third-party brands. So, it's very, very important through the catalogs to promote third-party products.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson from Thomas Weisel. Please proceed.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Marijn, I wonder if you could just talk to the strength you saw in the specialty diagnostic business.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Yes, obviously the strength in specialty diagnostics areas like anatomical pathology, microbiology are key for US, and I would say specifically [stood out] microbiology because of the flu situation in the second quarter. Second quarter is normally a weak flu season, but this quarter it was exceptionally strong because of H1N1. So microbiology stood out in specialty diagnostics.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Have you seen other areas of strength in that hospital end market such as capital spending?", "Marijn Dekkers", "No, I wouldn't say that there are other areas of specific strengths, no. I would still say that instruments are under pressure as well. And diagnostic instrumentation is under pressure more so than the consumables in the hospital end markets.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "And what were the countries driving the growth in the rest of the world?", "Peter Wilver", "", "Just a bunch of small countries. That comprises primarily Latin America would be the most of the countries in that grouping. So operator we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. Sir, the next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Just a few -- I think fairly quick follow-ups. You talked about consumables improving over the course of the second quarter. When did de-stocking start to improve specifically and how material was the impact of that on Q2 results? I was trying to see if the improving in de-stocking was a material impact, beneficial impact on Q2, or is this something that, that should start to become more material heading into the second half?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, you know, we can't really completely put our fingers on that, because when we don't get orders we're not going to ask every single customer, is it because of destocking or you're not doing experiments anymore. But I would say that, as I mentioned, consumables started to get better early May, and so in the quarter we had, two good months of better months while we still had a weak April. And, therefore, I would say that probably destocking started to improve in May.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay.", "Marijn Dekkers", "And then how exactly that helps us from a revenue point of view is very difficult to pinpoint, but it is helpful. Peter can you make a guess?", "Peter Wilver", "No, sequentially it's something less than a percent. We had a 1% impact, because of destocking in the first quarter, it was maybe a 0.5% in the second quarter, and if things continue then we would say that would probably go away as a discussion point in Q3.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay. And then a follow-up I think to one of Derik's earlier questions regarding industrial. I know you said it's not guidance, but you did talk about the potential for a Q4 rebound in the industrial end market. You're not simply talking about improving growth optics as a result of favorable comps you're actually talking about an increase in demand sequentially. Is that correct?", "Marijn Dekkers", "Well, we were at the bottom now. We will have a relatively easy comp in Q4 from an industrial point of view. So I would be talking both.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay. And then last question, you clearly reiterated your previous full year organic sales growth guidance. You put up a really solid Q2, at least a bit better than I think what most in the street were looking for. Does this imply that given that you didn't increase the sales growth guidance for the year on an organic basis, does it imply that Q2 is as expected for you guys, or was Q2 a little bit better than what you guys had expected similar to what the street was looking for?", "Marijn Dekkers", "I think it was pretty much in line with what we expected from an organic growth point of view. Of course, we weren't sure on the consumables side, but logic would have it that people can't keep destocking forever. So, with all of the gives and takes in a company that has $10 billion of revenue annually, it came out pretty close to where we thought it would be.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. Thanks a lot.", "Marijn Dekkers", "Okay. Thank you very much. So just in closing, thank you for being on the call today. I think you must be clear that we continue to manage through the economic headwinds, and that we believe the worst is behind us, in terms of the economic effect on Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "We continue to focus both on productivity and strategic investments because I want to reiterate again that our number one objective is to emerge from this period as an even stronger industry leader. So thank you all for listening to the call today, and for your continued support of Thermo Fisher. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

My name is Louisa, and I will be your operator for today. (Operator instructions) ", "I would now like to turn the call over to Ms. Amanda Clardy, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Communications for Life Technologies. Please proceed ma'am.", "Amanda Clardy", "Thank you Louisa and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies Second Quarter 2009 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are speakers, Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, we have Mark Stevenson, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Bernd Brust our Chief Commercial Officer joining us for Q&A.", "If you haven\u2019t received a copy of today\u2019s press release you can obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "Before we begin, I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today\u2019s press release or on our web site.", "For today\u2019s call we will be referencing a presentation that you can view online. Instructions to access the web cast are on our website. Additionally, we will be posting the presentation to our website upon the conclusion of this conference call.", "Greg will begin today\u2019s call with highlights for the first half and an update on our integration progress. He will then be followed by David, who will give a more detailed review of the company\u2019s second quarter operating results and our expectations for the rest of 2009.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, Amanda. We are extremely pleased to have delivered another quarter of SOLiD operating results. It has been a great first-half of the year and with good performance from legacy businesses, despite the tough macroeconomic conditions we all face today.", "In Q2 total company revenue grew 2% to $839 million. Revenue growth without the impact from foreign currency was 7.5%. Instrument revenue grew in the mid-teens as a result of good growth in all our instrument lines as well as sales of H1N1 related systems, which I will discuss in more detail in a moment.", "Consumables and services revenue grew as expected in the mid-single digits. Gross margin was a robust 66.7% equivalent to the first quarter and as a result of the integration related savings and positive price realization. We had another the impressive quarter of operating margin expansion resulting in ending operating margin of 27.2%, a 410 basis point improvement.", "Operating income improved 20% or 36% excluding the impact of currency. All of this resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.79 and free cash flow of $105 million. As we announced in our press release today, we have used a good portion of our cash to repay $200 million of our outstanding debt. Without question this was a great quarter, everything was firing on all cylinders and we accomplished quite a lot.", "I believe this performance once again demonstrates the strength of our operating model, the diversity of our technology portfolio and hard work of our people. It shows how essential our products are to the everyday work of our customers around the world.", "Before I get into the details of the quarter, I think it is important to note a factor that had a significant effect on our performance, so we can keep it in perspective when thinking about the future. In the last few months, we've all seen the world's attention focus on influenza A H1N1 virus. The CDC, World Health Organization, and other health agencies around the globe have been focused on detection and prevention since the outbreak first began.", "Life Technologies was contacted early on in the outbreak soon after the first case was discovered to help outfit labs around the world with our 7500 Fast and Fast DX PCR machines that run CDC developed assays. The assay also utilizes several critical biological components from us. We are pleased to be able to respond quickly to the needs of these global health organizations, and have created a dedicated team to continue to provide as much support as necessary.", "Our response to these agencies would not have been possible if Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems had been separate companies. We are able to provide our customers with a complete solution from instruments to reagents to service. It is a true testament to the strategic rationale for our combination and could not have come at a more critical time.", "The revenue we received from this quarter from H1N1 related products was approximately $15 million. As we do with each quarter, let me now give you an update on our strategic objectives for the year, growing our core business, flawlessly executing upon our integration plan, and investing for future growth.", "The first objective, growing our core business, focuses on delivering to our current customers the best possible products, services and support. Obviously our results in the first half of the year are a testament to how we are doing in this area. In the second quarter, we launched some notable new instruments as well as hundreds of new reagents, successfully implemented a new version of our reagent website for more convenient transactions, launched our first marketing promotion that combined products from both legacy companies, and completed a small technology purchase for IP-related to digital PCR, which will further expand our considerable PCR patent estate.", "These achievements are examples of the continuous improvements we make to grow our business. In addition, you may recall that we announced a small divestiture several weeks ago. This business which generated about $6 million in revenue per quarter provided an information management system for laboratories. This is an example of how we are focusing on our core business by finding the rightful owner for pieces that are not a strategic fit for Life Technologies going forward.", "It is critical for a company to focus on its core competencies in order to be successful, and we've shown that by making these difficult trade-offs we deliver better financial results.", "The second objective we are focusing on in 2009 is executing a flawless integration of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems. The integration is going extremely well, and we not only remain on track to deliver our three-year synergy target, we are now confident we will achieve more than originally communicated for our first year synergies. We now expect to achieve $95 million of synergy realization in 2009 versus our most recent guidance of $80 million.", "This increase in 2009 expectation is because we executed so effectively on our own original target, we were able to accelerate a number of actions that we had originally planned for 2010 with no impact on customers or on our business performance. We could not be more pleased with the efforts that our employees from across the company have put in to achieving the promise of this combination. When we originally announced the deal, there were many skeptics who couldn't see the vision and promise what our combined company could be, but our employees from both legacy companies rallied around what we had to accomplish to make one plus one equal more than two, and I can honestly say that they have not disappointed.", "I'm very proud to be part of this effort. I want to thank our people for going the extra mile for our customers and their colleagues each and every day. I would also like to highlight a major effort within the company over the last few months to further integrate our product offerings for our customers, and offer them even greater choice across our portfolio. In early July, we launched these key changes, which included making 1400 AB products available through Invitrogen sales channels, enhancing our assistance to support new coding, pricing, invoicing and distribution process and aligning compensation plans for our sales force to support these additional products.", "Now we don't expect these actions to generate substantial revenue in 2009, but there are a significant step towards capitalizing on the full potential of our combined company in front of our customers. As you can see from our integration tracker scorecard, all areas of the project are green, which signifies that everything is on track. We have over 50 full-time people on the integration effort and track over 7800 individual task line items. The largest part of the project in the last 90 days has been the development of these commercial systems to enable more co-operation in the field between the legacy, Invitrogen and AB sales teams.", "With these changes now complete and fully tested, we believe we will be able to create a much more powerful solution for our customers.", "Third and final objective that I want to talk about today is how we intend to invest for the future. One of the great benefits of our core business is that our product mix is heavily weighted towards high margin consumables allow us to generate enough cash to continue investing in the future of our business, and while we pay very close attention to executing on our strategies of today, we're always looking ahead on what might come next.", "We also believe that companies that not only weather tough economic times, but perhaps also take advantage of this time to invest for the future are the ones that ultimately achieve even greater shareholder value. To that end, we plan on investing in some critical R&D and sales and marketing programs that will drive even further growth.", "Our areas of interest include further acceleration of our sequencing roadmap and ramping up of our synthetic biology toolset to support biofuels research, continued expansion of our sales and service footprint around the globe.", "I will now hand it over to David to give you more details on our financial results for the first half and second quarter. David?", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter we grew revenue 2% including currency and 7.5% organically. We clearly are very happy with this level of organic revenue growth; however it is worth reiterating what Greg mentioned earlier about the revenue from H1N1 related sales. We estimate this added approximately $15 million of benefit resulting in roughly 2 points of organic growth to the quarter. We don't expect this level of revenue from H1N1 related products in the future.", "The rest of our strong performance was due to the continued strength in all of our divisions and several new product launches. Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 8% organically to $399 million in total revenue. The majority of H1N1 related revenue for products was in this division, resulting in approximately 4 points of organic growth for Molecular Biology Systems.", "Aside from H1N1 related revenue, a few notable areas that contributed to growth in this division were next-generation sequencing reagent kits, including Sample Prep [ph], a new transfection product launched last quarter and multiple new product launches this quarter, including pre-designed TaqMan Assays for disease research, a range of reagents for animal health, and a whole transcription kit for SOLiD.", "Genetic Systems had a strong quarter with $233 million in total revenue, representing 11% organic growth. To better understand the factors contributing to this growth, I will give some color on the different businesses in this division. The largest division is CE research with approximately 50% of the total revenue. This business declined in the low single digits in the quarter. You'll recall that our own original guidance called for declines of high-single to low-double digits, but we have had recent success with several large deals in the hospital and clinical labs markets as well as in emerging geographies.", "However, given that these deals are unpredictable and lumpy in nature, we are not prepared to change our original expectations for this business at this point. The second largest business in this division is our Applied Markets unit, which includes kits and CE systems most importantly for forensics. This business grew in the mid-teens bolstered by several large orders in the Asia-Pacific region.", "The last business in Genetic Systems is next-generation sequencing. We had continued acceleration for demand of our SOLiD next-generation sequencing product this quarter and hit a record win rate for new orders. Our system is now at the point where we are clearly the leader in throughput and accuracy, which is critically important in such areas as cancer research. This is clearly paying off in the number of new wins for SOLiD, such as the one we announced today with the University of Queensland\u2019s Institute for Molecular Biology.", "Our third division, Cell Systems grew revenue by 4.5% organically to $201 million. Most product areas within Cell Systems contributed to this growth. Our most successful Invitrogen product launch ever, Countess, continues to drive meaningful growth and is a great example of how we are increasingly able to solve customer problems with benchtop instruments.", "Our stem cell business continues to grow significantly as many of the products are now considered the gold standard in stem cell research and are validated across many protocols. We have a new website specifically designed for stem cell researchers that is helping to drive traffic to our product offerings.", "We also had our largest revenue quarter ever for our research cell culture media and reagents partly due to the success of our new bottle design. Growth in these business units were slightly offset by year-over-year decline in bio-production related products. As a reminder bio-production revenues, which are approximately 20% of this division are very lumpy, so fluctuations in growth is typical.", "Moving on to the last division Mass Spec, our joint venture with MDS, revenue declined 12% organically in the second quarter. Recall Q2 2008 was a high-volume quarter for Mass Spec and therefore created a difficult comparison period. First half organic growth for the division was a negative 6.8%, which is in line with our expectations. The end markets for this division appear to be stabilizing and in fact we saw good growth outside the United States, especially in Europe and China. In terms of the future, we still expect this business to be flat to down 10% for the year, and we would anticipate that the NIH stimulus will be of modest benefit to growth in the fourth quarter.", "Other revenue was $6.8 million. As a reminder this is associated with our Mass Spec division, but not in the joint-venture and consists of consumable products used on discontinued Mass Spec systems.", "In terms of organic growth by region, excluding the Mass Spec division, the Americas and Europe both grew 6%, Asia-Pacific was up 30%, and Japan grew 1%. Currency this quarter impacted revenue growth by approximately 5.5 percentage points net of our hedging program. The negative impact to EPS was approximately $0.14, including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue, other income, and the Mass Spec joint venture.", "Before I begin with the additional financial comparisons, let me remind you that we are comparing all of our non-GAAP financial results to the pro forma income statements we published on our website that combines Invitrogen and AB for all of 2008.", "Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.7%, an increase of 140 basis points from Q2 \u201808. This improvement was primarily due to synergy realization, improved price and manufacturing plant productivity. This was somewhat offset by product mix and currency exchange.", "Second quarter operating expenses were $332 million, a decrease of approximately $15.5 over prior year\u2019s levels, due mostly to reduced currency exchange impact and savings from integration related synergies, somewhat offset by increases in employee bonuses and depreciation. Sequentially operating expenses grew by approximately 4% due to headcount related expenses and outside service fees, somewhat offset by additional synergy realization.", "Operating income was $228 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year including the impact from currency and 36% excluding the impact from currency.", "Operating margin was 27.2% representing 410 basis points of improvement over the prior year including the impact from currency. This level of operating margin expansion primarily resulted from organic revenue growth and the realization of integration related synergies.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $700,000 of interest income and $9.6 million of other income consisting of $14.5 million of income from our Mass Spec joint venture offset by foreign currency losses.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $39 million. As Greg mentioned earlier, we just repaid $200 million of term loan B debt last week. This repayment will result in lower interest expense in the long term, however, in the short term the related debt issuance costs are expensed at the time of repayment. The acceleration of this amortization will be approximately $7 million in the third quarter.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.3%. We expect our full-year tax rate to be 29.5%, which is slightly above our previous full-year expectations of 29%. The increase is due to a greater amount of income earned in the United States than originally expected.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 179 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options. Assuming our stock price continues to increase throughout the year, our share count in the second half is expected to be between the range of 183 million and 186 million shares.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.79. GAAP earnings per share were $0.22, which includes $0.42 per share of acquisition-related amortization expenses, $0.04 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1, and $0.11 per share of business integration costs and other expense.", "Comparability year-over-year is limited for your earnings per share figures due to the merger with Applied Biosystems.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $583 million.

This is made up of our convertible debt of $1.15 billion and straight debt of approximately $2.4 billion. As I mentioned, we have now repaid $200 million of this debt.", "For the first half of 2009, revenue increased 6.5% organically, and operating margins have expanded by 300 basis points including the impact from currency. Clearly this is the result of a multiple of things ranging from hard work on the integration efforts to conservative expense spending due to the uncertain economic environment we are operating in to timing.", "Nonetheless, we remain cautious about expecting the first-half trend to continue. With that in mind I will now move on to our expectations for second half of the year.", "We now expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits versus low-single digits we indicated last quarter. With that level of organic growth in the second half, we expect full-year non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.70 to $2.80.", "This revised guidance includes several items that are important to note. First, we have now included the expected Q4 impact of the NIH stimulus, although we believe it will be minimal in 2009. As we have stated before, we expect most of the revenue impact from the stimulus package will fall in 2010.", "The second item included in our revised expectations is the increased synergy target for 2009 that Greg specified earlier. Through the second quarter, we have now completed actions that will ensure realization of $80 million of this, this year, and we expect to generate another $15 million in the coming two quarters, resulting in a full year 2009 synergy realization of $95 million.", "The third item included in the new guidance is the revised impact of currency exchange rates. In the third quarter, we expect currency exchange at today's rates and with our hedging programs to negatively impact growth rates by approximately 2 to 3 points. In the fourth quarter, again at today's rates we expect it will be flat to positive one point of growth.", "The last new item now included in our guidance is the impact from our divestiture mentioned earlier. The LIMS analytical software business contributed about $6 million per quarter in revenue with approximately 10% operating margins. We have removed this contribution from our outlook starting in August.", "And finally, as is our practice, I will also give you a few items to take into consideration for the coming quarter. Although the second half organic growth rate is expected to be in the mid-single digits, it will be unequally distributed by quarter. We expect to grow organically in the low-single digits in the third quarter and in the high single digits in the fourth quarter. As you will recall the majority in the $30 million of royalty revenue declines that we have previously communicated happens in the second half of this year with approximately $12 million to $15 million of the decline occurring in the third quarter.", "Gross margins are expected to be sequentially lower due to added royalty revenue decline, lower price realization, lower fixed costs absorption as well as a the shift in mix to more instrument sales.", "Operating expenses will increase sequentially due to several R&D and marketing programs that began late in the second quarter.", "We expect capital expenditures to ramp up in the remaining quarters and to be in line with our guidance of $175 million to $200 million for the year, including $50 million of integration related capital.", "Free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $475 million, and this is an increase in our estimate given last quarter of $450 million.", "With that, I will now hand the call back over to Greg for closing remarks.", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, David. So to wrap up the first half of the year, without question we posted some great results. Organic growth in the mid-single digits and organic margin expansion of hundreds of basis points in this type of economy says a lot about the type of business we have, especially if you look at other companies in this space and beyond.", "Clearly our focus on the academic market continues to pay off as does the investments that both legacy companies have made in Asia. We remain focused on driving growth in our core business and sometimes that means making hard choices to divest good business units that just aren\u2019t strategic to where we want to take the company.", "We will continue to take a hard look at our portfolio and make those decisions as necessary. We are generating strong free cash flow, which is giving us the ability to rapidly pay down our debt each and every quarter, and finally we are making tremendous progress on our integration efforts so much so that we are able to be a key partner to agencies such as the CDC, something as critical as H1N1 detection. This is a perfect example of the promise of the merger between Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems. Had we been standalone companies, we never could have provided the rapid response or work flow solution that the World Health Organization needed in this situation.", "We are more confident than ever that this was the right combination at the right time.", "With that I will hand it back over to Amanda for questions and answers.", "Amanda Clardy", "Thank you, Greg. Louisa, you can now open up the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JP Morgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi, good afternoon and congratulations on a great quarter.", "Greg Lucier", "Thank you.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thank you.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "You know maybe, David, I will take the bait on a comment that you had made about SOLiD and you quoted kind of record win rates, can you just give us a sense of where these systems are being placed, demand within core genome centers, outside the genome centers, and maybe US International. And then as a follow-up the acquisition you announced, it looks like there are some sequencing applications. So what is the timeline in terms of incorporating that into the sequencing pathway?", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, Tycho. Let me actually hand that over to Mark Stevenson.", "Mark Stevenson", "Hi Tycho, it is Mark here. So firstly on SOLiD, we are seeing really this uptake of SOLiD going on and really translation of research centers around the world. We will quote just an example of one in Australia. It is really where the labs see the advantage of the throughput and the accuracy, particularly our win rate in cancer centers where that application is important in the accuracy, and also while customers are doing gene expression and the throughput translates into higher tag number in those gene expression applications. So it is really helping carrying it around the world for us and it was a great quarter in terms of the win rates as we said. In terms of the digital PCR technology, it is really an IP play [ph] at this point that we see broader applications not just in the PCR as you point to but also there may be some applications into next-generation sequencing.", "It is something as we invest for the future you will see as roll out as well as licensing program as we go into 2010.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, that is helpful. Maybe turning to the integration process, you know I appreciate you guys updating the synergy targets, Greg can you comment a little bit on what that you are pulling forward here, these roof top [ph] closures or these working out input costs a little bit more aggressively?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think it is primarily related to the items that we have really targeted for 2009 into the early part of 2010. So as we had said before, these are synergies around some of the back-office areas of finance, HR, IT, the support structure as well as eliminating the existing overhead that was in place with the (inaudible) structure. And then also we have seen some ability to accelerate the commercial synergies around where we are putting AB products into supply centers around the world, and our pricing realization has been able to be a little bit more successful than we thought we would be able to do only in 2009.", "So overall I think it really was spread across the integration. These were ideas and tasks that we had targeted in the first quarter or so of 2010 that we are able to move into this calendar year and get them done.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, that is great. I will get back in the queue. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good afternoon, and congratulations from us as well.", "Greg Lucier", "Thank you.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "With respect to the comments on the NIH and the impact on the back half of the year and then 2010, is that guidance based on kind of instruments starting off in the fourth quarter, which I guess are less of a percentage of your overall business, and then as those projects start to really ramp up that is when we will start to see the impact in 2010?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think that \u2013 yes. So what we said again is that we expect that the impact in 2009 will be minimal. It is hard to predict because not much of the money has started to flow yet. We think that most of the impact will be in 2010, and we think that the purchases will probably start with instruments and then move into consumables. What we have seen that there is probably going to be more funds in 2011 than we originally expected as well.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then the guidance in the back half of the year with respect to H1N1, is that assuming that the instruments that were placed, the reagent consumption starts to come down over the back half or you say you are not expecting another impact, you know, could you talk a little bit about what you saw in Q2? Was it mostly instruments or instruments and consumables?", "Mark Stevenson", "Hi Quintin, this is Mark. I will take the second part on the H1N1. So the initial amount was very much the public health labs, particularly here in the US gearing up with instruments. What we expect during the second half of the year is more consumable usage on those instrument platforms, both here in the US and also other countries around the world that have started now monitoring.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, so that is \u2013 so you're still expecting a bit more H1N1 but at a more modest pacing than we saw in Q2?", "Mark Stevenson", "That is correct. We expect some amount of benefit, but not at the level that we saw in Q2.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Okay, and then just kind of as a strategic question follow-up, the fact that you were able to ramp up so quickly and help out the public labs, does it costs you too maybe kind of rethink how fast your progress towards maybe a diagnostic strategy now that you have combined the two companies?", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, I think that is a very good follow-up and certainly we see this as a model for how we might initially enter certainly some of the diagnostics space. In just the last couple of weeks, we introduced two platforms at the WACR the main cancer meeting, and at that we had both the 7500 DX, and also our new CE instrument, the 3500. And this opportunity for partner organizations like we did with the CDC to partner with us in different content or different assays, allows us now to start to write content onto those platforms as we begin to build out a larger strategy into diagnostics.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi thanks and again congratulations. Can you talk about Asia-Pac? It seemed like growth there was really off the charts. You know, I want to see what some of the core elements of that were if we look at your results, it seems like you also indicated some of the forensics business were strong ex-US. I want to see if there is any sort of correlation there. And then in general, why you think that that growth was more indicative of some of the strength in the end markets or was it some synergy capture as well there from a revenue perspective. What is the sort of breakdown of the performance there?", "Bernd Brust", "Hi Ross, this is Bernd. You know I think it is a little bit of all of the above that you just mentioned. Certainly the end markets continue to see considerable strength in both the research as well as the applied markets. Synergies, the two teams are certainly starting to work closer together to drive portfolio synergies in that region, but if I look at Asia Pacific particularly the greater China market, the organic growth in all segments continues to be incredibly healthy.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. You know, Greg when you were going through some of your commentary, you threw out a word I hadn\u2019t heard you use much before and that was biofuels, it is sort of another part of the space from molecular biology perspective that hasn't been talked about a lot. Is there sort of a distinct strategy there, it is not a space that you sell much into either with the some of the venture backed companies or some of the larger players who were dealing there and some of the alternative energies.", "Greg Lucier", "You know, Ross, we are selling into the biofuels space now. As you say, primarily into these start-ups that have been funded as well as some work around the energy labs. As we look forward with the stimulus funding, considerable amount of money will go to the Department of Energy, specifically earmarked for biofuels research, and as we look at what needs to be done in that space, it is very reminiscent of real back into the core, core beginnings of the Invitrogen and in ABI. And so we have lot of the toolsets necessary to really create synthetic biology toolkits that we think is what is going to be needed here in biofuels, and our goal over the next 12 months is to finish off the other 30% and really create a kind of end-to-end piece of tools if you will for biofuels researchers around the world.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great, thanks Greg and one \u2013 a couple of quick cleanup things for David, just again what was the FX impact on the bottom line for the quarter, and how should we think about sort of the hedging going forward, is it sort of what we have seen throughout the year, has there been any sort of change to the strategy, is the sort of relative volatility we had seen more in the first half here more indicative of what we are likely to see going forward. And just also one cleanup on the royalty, you talked about with PCR for Q3, can you just give us again sort of what the full-year impact is that you have spoken to on that number relative to the 12 to 15 for Q3?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, okay, so one at a time. The currency impact in the second quarter was \u2013 on the bottom line was $0.14 EPS. The question in terms of, what do we expect in the second half in terms of volatility, yes, we're assuming that it is going to be equally volatile in the second half of the year. And then your final question on the revenue around the royalty impact, you know full year, we said it could drop $30 million and it would be back-end loaded with the impact particularly in Q3 of $12 million of $15 million drop in royalty income.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay, just \u2013 sorry to point on this on the currency, that just seems like in terms of margin points are a little higher on the EPS line than I would have thought for the quarter. How does that compare to sort of what we saw in Q1?", "David Hoffmeister", "It is pretty comparable but higher and it is simply due to the mix of currencies.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay.", "David Hoffmeister", "And again you know we tried to explain this before, you know, our big currencies are sterling, Canadian dollar, yen and euro, and it can swing $0.03 to $0.05 just based on that mix.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Okay great. Thank you, David.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Derik De Bruin with UBS. Please proceed.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Lucier", "Good afternoon.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "So, you had adjusted operating margin of 27.1% during the quarter. You know, I know you are not going to give an outlook for 2010 on this, but you basically beat my estimate by over 250 basis points, and I guess you know how sustainable is that number going forward as we kind of look at them? And the estimated royalties are going to come in that. I am just curious as to where given all the synergies that are going to be coming in, where that operating margin is going to cap?", "Greg Lucier", "I think it is reasonable to have it somewhere in the high 20s, but again we expect the operating margin to come down in the second half of the year, you know as we tried to lay out on the call.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Right, obviously, but the royalties will have an impact on \u2013 I'm just trying to say if it is like the high 20s number is something you think for the overall business it is certainly a target longer-term going forward that is where I'm trying to get to?", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, I think it is a longer-term target, yes.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay that is great, and I guess how many, just going back to the NIH question, I guess how many grants are you aware of that specifically specified SOLiD as part of the grant process?", "Amanda Clardy", "Mark, why don\u2019t you take that one?", "Mark Stevenson", "Oh, yes, it is Mark here. We don't have a specific number. We have a huge increase in the number of grant applications that we have been supporting and we are aware of. At this stage, a lot of people will put in for grants to get funded actually by project, and then both either specified or non-specified, we expect to then compete on SOLiD and other projects. A lot will be disease focused projects, where we will also compete with our consumables going through this as the labs get more funding.", "Greg Lucier", "We're pretty optimistic, you know, this market is really just getting going for us to get position ourselves as the money starts to flow at the end of this year, and beginning of next.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "I'm just wondering if like, are there grants out there that have 10, 15, 20 SOLiD specified in their grant applications?", "Mark Stevenson", "We don't have details on all of that. What we know is there are multiple units being put in similar to the customer we announced today that had 2 originally and had scaled up to 11 instruments. We will expect (inaudible) as same as customers get money, they will add SOLiD to scale up with more additional units to increase their throughput.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay, and just one final question, I mean during the quarter there were some issues with manufacturing at Genzyme with respect to some contamination, and I guess \u2013 were you involved, were you potentially exposed to that or I guess does that have any impact on your business, and I guess just in terms of a broader perspective, it is like, my understanding is that certainly just given the nature of cell culture that those that have a contamination that is probably more common than people would imagine. I guess, can you talk a little bit just about the cell culture space, and specifically what you have seen in that, and if there anything to say about that particular issue at Genzyme?", "Greg Lucier", "Maybe I can grab that one Derik. As you know we never comment on who our customers are for cell culture by our production business. So I really can't comment to Genzyme specifically. But more broadly, these types of issues that Genzyme is facing are not in the ordinary, but not extraordinary either and it is just part of the process of biological manufacturing.", "The one highlight I would say that as situations like that took place at Genzyme happen, we created a whole new business around using PCR technology for rapid viral detection and it is enjoying great growth. So it is a nice compliment to our bioproduction space and further enhances the overall solution we can give to companies like Genzyme and others in that whole biological manufacturing area.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Great, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen", "Good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Let me start with a couple of synergy-related items, does the acceleration in year one synergies that you have talked about in your prepared remarks at all impact your longer-term synergy targets, specifically I believe you year three target outlined a couple of quarters ago was for $150 million in cost synergies and $60 million in revenue synergies. And I guess the second question on synergies is in terms of your 2009 increase, is any of that driven by greater than expected sales synergies or market share capture?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, as I said in my comments, the overall synergies were now increasing in today's release is just for what we have achieved in 2009. And it is primarily a pull forward from 2010. The overall target for the integration remains the same for the project as we originally specified. In terms of your last part, in terms of where it is coming from, as I mentioned in an earlier question, it really has come from a whole variety of tasks that we had lined up for this integration, including greater commercial synergies in terms of pull through of products from the new channels or the various channels that we have to the customer.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen", "Okay, and then let me turn to H1N1, was there any H1N1 contributions factored into your earlier guidance, and then are there specific instruments, which have exceeded your expectations in terms of the demand related to H1N1?", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, we urgently had minimal instruments in that guidance with certainly exceeded our expectations. Really the instruments that has been most adopted has been the 7500 Fast DX, which was the one that was cleared by the FDA for use with the CDC test. This is an instrument that is being developed now for the diagnostic use under (inaudible) and so it has been that instrument and we accelerated manufacturing in Singapore in order to bring forth the necessary shipments in a timely manner.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen", "Okay, and then last area I wanted to touch on in terms of sequencing. In Q1 I believe you indicated that you \u2013 revenue recorded a decent number of SOLiDs in the quarter, maybe more than you had in the previous few quarters and that CE for research held up better than expected, especially at the higher end in part via the use of CE to validate next gen sequencing works. Can you talk about how these dynamics played out in the second quarter and then one last follow-up on that, could you also just talk about timelines for next gen sequencing pipelines relative to what you have outlined in the past, specifically SOLiD 4 and your initiatives in single molecule.", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, I will take the three parts of that questions. Firstly, the dynamics are pretty much the same. We continue to see you know, over time see research will decline, but in that segment we had diagnostic customers that are buying that platforms and using them in more validated settings. We also have recourse in that genetic systems. The update in the applied markets, which is forensic labs that we continue to talk about particularly in Asia this last quarter adopted more systems.", "In terms of the roadmap for SOLiD, we have a really robust roadmap and you know, as you saw as we published the first example of a whole genome with 17 X coverage with 50 gigabytes run with beta. We are really making tremendous progress on that. We will update the system later on during the summer to a version 3.5 for our customers that will be a minor update of software and consumables but really give them tremendous more performance on this roadmap, and then early next year we will upgrade our system and introduce version 4, which will really then take us ahead in terms of where we are, in terms of performance in the system, and really accentuate this end-to-end applications workflow for these throughput in applications.", "So we are really making tremendous progress on that. We also continue to invest in next-generation systems for single molecule. We really see that as a complimentary application. Will there room for our short rate systems and then also be in the market with a longer rate systems in a competitive timeframe as we come out with that product.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen", "Okay, thanks a lot for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Hi, thanks for taking the question. Excuse me. First I was just looking at the sort of long-term R&D for new product development. Could you maybe give us a sense of how those efforts are being divided up between maybe the three business units these days; Mark, can talk a little bit about the generic systems and the next gen efforts. On sequencing I'm wondering, you know, how do you kind of gauge that verses your investments in the consumables like stem cells, maybe the (inaudible).", "Mark Stevenson", "You know, I can see we are very active in looking at the portfolio. I mean, our first priority and our largest investment is in sequencing and we certainly talk about investments there. We absolutely have a strong roadmap and Greg talked about some of the many new products we have introduced in real-time PCR. Within that molecular biology franchise we are really investing around our core qPCR, the reagents, the ambient brands, some of the transfection device that you saw. So we are really building out those everyday needs for the lab in that molecular biology section, and that takes nearly a third of our proportion of our investment that goes in R&D.", "And the third area is really investing around the cell, particularly as you say around stem cells. It continues to be active growth. You saw us launch a new website for that. There is new products and sell lines we have been introducing as well as investments around the cellular analysis space. We think in the same way we've been able to really automate and simplify the workflow around molecular biology and sequencing, we can also do around the cell analysis space. We are investing heavily against that and we see good opportunity to grow as ever more people go to single cell work or they go to look for analyzing within the cellular context.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay, great and then David, a question on the numbers here. I think you said $50 million of this year\u2019s CapEx budget going into integration related activities, is it fair to say the majority of that $50 million would roll off in 2010?", "David Hoffmeister", "No.", "Amanda Clardy", "A portion will.", "David Hoffmeister", "A portion will, but I think that and we haven\u2019t put together our detailed budget yet for 2010, but I think that our capital expenditures will still have a significant portion of integrated related investment \u2013 integration related investment in 2010.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay, great and then just you know, it's a follow-up on Derik's questions regarding long-term margin potential of the company. I'm just wondering, you know, can you maybe highlight a couple of areas where you see upside today versus you know, when the merger closed last year and then you know, how is that list sort of evolved if a couple of things moved here or you are seeing new opportunities?", "Greg Lucier", "You bet. In terms of where the upside is happening, first one I would tell you is we have been putting together a dynamite manufacturing strategy where we are taking the best practices from some of the key facilities that AB and Invitrogen had, bringing it together and then applying it across the entire operational network. That is giving us good improvement. As I mentioned before, we've also seen really accelerated improvement with price realization across the AB consumables portfolio and now moving into the AB instrument portfolio, and I think we had outlined that was going to be a key area of integration when we put the project together and it is certainly meeting or exceeding our expectations.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Great, thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Hi, thank you. So David on the cash flow outlook it looks like you've done about 250 or so in operating cash the first half and then your net income \u2013 your guidance was about 250 and net income in the back half of the year. So it is basically about 150 million of I guess balance sheet changes and I noticed that DSO or the receivables ticked up. So is that the primary source of cash from the balance sheet to get you to the 650?", "Amanda Clardy", "Yes, so he is referring to the difference between the fixed fees [ph] without the integration related.", "David Hoffmeister", "Okay, yes, yes. So it is you know, we in this quarter we did see an increase in our accounts receivable. We do expect that we will be able to increase, we'll bring that down and we also expect some improvement in inventory. You know, offsetting that in terms of free cash flows we expect capital expenditures would be higher in the second half of the year.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Okay, and then you referenced in the prepared comments $7 million of debt, you know, I guess accelerated debt amortization. That's not in the adjusted numbers or at the guidance.", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, it is.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "It is, okay. Okay, and then also on the synergy you mentioned you exited 2Q on an $80 million run rate. So is it reasonable to assume there was about $20 million of synergies in the second quarter?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, what we meant by that $80 million is that we've taken actions through the second quarter that will generate $80 million in savings for the full year, and what we expect to do it will take further actions in the second half of the year that will generate another $15 million in synergies so that our total realized synergies for the year will be $95 million.", "Jon Wood \u2013 Bank of America/Merrill Lynch", "Understood. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Hi guys. So a couple of questions on the geographic trends, I mean the US or the Americas and Europe both you know moved around sequentially, pretty meaningfully. Could you give us some idea of you know, what \u2013 were there particular end-markets that improved or sort of got worse and some of the one-time stuff in the quarter that might have caused those changes?", "Bernd Brust", "Hi, this is Bernd, you know if you look at the Americas and Europe, I mean fairly stable in what we are seeing there. The US is seeing more and more strength in academic. The research markets are healthy there at this point. We continue to see some challenges in the industrial markets, and farm and biotech, although I think they have started to stabilize a little bit as well and we are seeing good strength in Latin America if we look at our Americas region.", "In Europe, it's really the core countries in UK, Germany, and France that are holding their own fairly well. The UK particularly was very strong, but that region really has been in that level for sometime now and we stay pretty consistent in the market segments around the academic world over the last three or four years now.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks and then I appreciate the detail you guys gave on CE, but could you help us understand a little bit better. Is this through sort of installed base growth on the applied market side or are we are seeing kind of an upgrade cycle that people going to you know, to higher end or higher throughput instruments on the CE side and how that impacts your visibility in that business?", "Mark Stevenson", "You know, this is Mark here. It's really true installed base growth. So, you know, what we see for example in China is that you know, the forensic labs, while the primary labs may have been equipped. Now we are equipping the secondary and tertiary labs as they build out their forensic strategy. As you see in diagnostic labs, we see some content that goes into diagnostic companies that runs very well where you really want to sequence it on the CE platform. It's robust, it's proven. It's now, you know, we will have a CE IDT [ph] mark on it. So it is very much a validated solution. So this is new installed base that will also take new consumables. You know, on the downside what we see is the deinstallation goes on within the genome centers as they switch to next-generation sequencing, and that trend has been the offsetting trend we have seen in this business.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. And then last question, just you guys alluded to some of you know, increased spending on R&D and SG&A into the end of the quarter that will flow through next quarter. Can you help to just quantify that a little bit better in terms of you know, the magnitude there that we should be looking for.", "Amanda Clardy", "This is Amanda. So I'll give in terms of the numbers now, let Greg talk more about kind of what we are \u2013 where we are investing and it is not sizable. Otherwise, we are set up that up, and we are trying to get it across, and our expenses will go up sequentially, but clearly there is only so much you could start in one month. So it is not going to be significant but they will go up sequentially, and maybe Greg you can talk a little bit about more where we are investing for growth in the future.", "Greg Lucier", "You bet. As I've mentioned in the prepared comments, we are taking advantage of the strength we are having in the business to further build out the whole biofuels toolset kit. We have a number of great projects that I think Mark has talked about in sequencing that we are further investing into, be it a SOLiD roadmap or single molecule detection, and then importantly we are also investing into the commercial front end of the business. We have a number of very positive changes going on. For example, continuing to build up and build out our website not only in Europe and the Americas, but now moving into Asia. So we are just taking advantage of the strength of the business to continue to try to grow the business even faster in subsequent quarters.", "Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Please proceed.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "Yes, thanks for taking the call. I just had one question, I don't know if who wants to answer this, Greg, or if you want to have someone else, but I know this quarter one of the big issues are perhaps, you know, areas of caution was you are going to start moving towards on these more customer facing integration initiatives and it looks like you pulled that off fairly well, but maybe you can just talk about kind of you know, how that went, if there are some issues that either arise or that you are dealing with or just kind of maybe how that process is going. So I think that was, you know, a bit of a concern for investors still.", "Bernd Brust", "Hi Jon, it is Bernd. Maybe a couple of things, you know, the biggest customer facing change probably that has happened has been some of our customer service consolidations in both the US and Europe that has moved very smoothly and it is pretty much done at this point without much issue actually. The second one that has happened in the second half or the beginning of July is now in place for the second half of the year.", "It's where we\u2019ve made some changes to the portfolio for selling teams and so there is some change in what the teams are carrying as you noted two separate selling teams were not consolidated. So Invitrogen sales force now continues to be focused on selling the biological products, best-in-class reagent offerings, and the applied biosystems team continues to focus on providing the customers within the greater workflow solutions.", "The big change that we've made in the second half now is that we have moved around 1400 or 1500 AB skews into the Invitrogen selling teams bags so that we have a much broader channel coverage to our customers for that portfolio. Those teams are now being trained and are actively selling those products in addition to the AB teams. The final change that we made effective July 1 was consolidation of some of our front-end systems. So we are now in a common CRM, and although there is some training involved in that that also has gone very, very smoothly and really so far from what we have seen there has been no issue in any of the changes that we have made that have negatively impacted our customers.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "So just by getting the timeline right, the customer service that kind of \u2013 already we're kind of seeing some of the results in this quarter, maybe they showed up, the other ones are going to be more in the second half. Is there any I know it is going smoothly, so you don't really anticipate any \u2013 you don't foresee any potentially hiccups here in terms of the second half?", "Greg Lucier", "At this point, we don't see any issues with the changes that we have made.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, great. And then, David, it looks from \u2013 if I just look at your cash flow statements it looks like you probably \u2013 this $200 million that you paid you probably replaced with new debt, and I'm just curious what that \u2013 if that's right. What the terms of the new debt are in terms of what you are paying?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, we didn\u2019t. We repaid, we've taken on no new debt. We repaid the debt in the third quarter. So the cash flow statement you'd be looking at doesn't reflect a $200 million paid out.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "It is just all out of your own cash.", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Is there anything you can do given that this floor of kind of LIBOR at $300 and given where LIBOR is, is there anything that you can do to you know to potentially lower that payment?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, other than repay it there isn\u2019t \u2013 that is the floor.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "So, it is not worth trying to get some \u2013 potentially the credit markets have eased a little bit in terms of trying to potentially, you know, alter that structure with some new debts.", "David Hoffmeister", "I mean it's the credit markets. We're constantly taking a look at what we could potentially do to lower the interest cost, but as of yet they haven't moved enough so that it you know makes sense.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay, and then last questions. We think about you know the H1N1 and the potential comp. Is \u2013 how \u2013 you know, what's kind of in the \u2013 what's your take on how prepared some of these public health centers are if we get another \u2013 if next year turns out to be worse than this year as many people potentially suggest that it could be. How prepared are they? Would it be a matter that the instruments are now there and it is just an issue of the reagents or would we need even more instrument if we look at next year?", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, it's hard to predict at this stage. So what we factored in is you know there is a good installed base out there and that we would expect an ongoing level of monitoring. That's really what we factored in at the moment to our estimates.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie", "Okay. Thanks, Amanda.", "Amanda Clardy", "Louisa, I show that we are at the end of our hour. So unfortunately we will not be able to take anymore questions, however, as you know, you can always follow up with me afterwards if there are still additional callers in the queue. This will now conclude our second-quarter 2009 earnings conference call. This web cast will be available via replay on our website for three weeks, and thank you again for joining us this afternoon.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

I would like to introduce a moderator for the call Mr. Kenneth Apicerno Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "On the call today with me is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Peter Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website, thermofisher.com, until November 20, 2009. To reach the replay of the call on our website, click on Investors then Webcasts and Presentations.", "Please also be aware that a copy of the press release of our third quarter 2009 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section of our website, under the heading Financial Results.", "Let me start by briefly covering the Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 27, 2009, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligations to do so even if our estimates change and therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during the call today, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2009, earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website thermofisher.com, under the heading Financial Results.", "With that I would like to now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks for joining our third quarter earnings call. I am Marc Casper, President and CEO of Thermo Fisher, as of October 15th. I just want to take a minute to say that I am honored to step into this role, excited about the opportunities we have, as the world leader in serving science, and ready to lead our company to achieve our goals for long-term growth, with the support of course of our 35,000 employees around the world.", "I would also like to thank Marijn Dekkers for all that he has done for Thermo Fisher and for me personally. We have worked together closely over the past eight years developing and executing the company strategy, and I appreciate the support and the opportunities he has given me along the way. He is handed over a company that is built on the solid foundation with many exciting growth prospects that we only begun to tap. I wish Marijn the best as he takes on the top job at Bayer.", "Turning to our Q3 performance, I will review our financials at a high level, give you a sense of what we are seeing in our markets at this point in the year, and highlight a few of the growth opportunities that are helping us to create long-term shareholder value.", "First the financials, to sum up our Q3 results, we are extremely pleased to report a continued trend of improving revenue and operating performance as the year has progressed. Our results came in very much as we expected keeping us solidly on track to achieve our financial goals for 2009.", "Our reported revenues declined by 2% compared with a year ago quarter. Organic revenues also declined 2%, however this was an improvement over the minus 5% we recorded in Q2 of this year. Although we haven't seen significant changes in the capital side of our business yet, we do believe the worst is behind us.", "Sales of consumables on the other hand are recovering nicely and getting progressively better every quarter. In Q3, sales of consumables grew better than 5% organically, compared with the 1% organic growth, we reported in Q2. This was a major contributor to our overall revenue improvements for the company.", "We've also been able to leverage the top line to deliver good sequential margin improvement. Compared with Q2, we improved our adjusted operating margin by 50 basis points to 17.3%. We're especially pleased that we were able to deliver adjusted EPS growth, on both the sequential and year-to-year basis, with 4% growth in adjusted EPS over our 2008 results.", "Two primary factors led to our improved profitability. First, the increasing sales of consumables were key contributors. Second, the cost cutting actions that we began to implement, at around this time last year, are really taking hold.", "This included selective layoffs, furloughs, and site consolidation in certain parts of the company, along with tight controls around discretionary spending company-wide. These were difficult decisions and very carefully weighed, but I believe they were the right thing to do to ensure the long-term strength of the company.", "Of course, we have a culture of continuous improvement from PPI, our Practical Process Improvement program. This continues to create an ongoing focus on productivity improvement for employees that has reflected in our results as well.", "Finally, we delivered on another strong quarter of free cash flow, totaling $346 million, which is near record levels. So, our business model continues to generate a tremendous amount of cash. We continue to use our cash to invest for growth in the long-term, and our acquisition of B.R.A.H.M.S. AG in the third quarter, which I'll talk about more in a few minutes, is a great example of that.", "Let me now turn to a brief update on our TN market, and what we\u2019re seeing from our primary customer base.", "In biopharma market, the key takeaway is sequential improvement. The overall softness that we experienced with our large pharma customers is clearly abating, and we continue to see steady improvement since the beginning of the year.", "In Q2, we told you that growth in our top 20 accounts was well in the mid-single digits. I\u2019m pleased to report that we doubled that performance in Q3.", "Long-term, we\u2019re confident that our leading position in the industry and our strong relationships with key account offers us a significant opportunity to serve these customers in a way that nobody else in our space can.", "The tougher economic climate has actually been a good catalyst for change, that should benefit our business model, which is based on more effective purchasing through our breadth of products and services and easier access to our extensive commercial channels.", "In addition, we saw a nice uptick in our BioProcess Container and Media businesses and sales of our BioReagents for life science research was also strong.", "Turning to government and academic markets, it\u2019s apparent that were innovations really makes a difference, our customers are managing to find the money to buy these products in spite of the economy. We had an excellent quarter in sales of mass spectrometry systems for life science research.", "As I mentioned before, we believe that roughly half of all mass spectrometry grants tie to stimulus programs have been written around our technology. This can also play out well for sales of our reagents and consumables, since they will be needed to support new mass spec installations over the long-term.", "Government stimulus is definitely a bright spot on the horizon, but it\u2019s hard to predict exactly when the bulk of the monies will start to flow. So far, we haven\u2019t seen much here in the US, although some grant money is trickling in. Our customers are confident they will be getting these funds, and we should see some activity in Q4. We expect the stimulus programs to benefit us most in 2010, and we remain confident that it's a $100 million to $200 million opportunity globally for Thermo Fisher over 12 months.", "In addition, we have already seen some activity from stimulus programs in China and Japan, particularly around air quality, food safety and forensic applications. So, these geographies offer another opportunity for positive growth momentum.", "In healthcare markets, we saw more stability this quarter than earlier in the year, as evidenced by much stronger sales of consumables to hospitals through our healthcare catalog. Also the H1N1 flu has led to a ramp up in sales of test kits provided by our microbiology and healthcare catalog businesses.", "Last, industrial markets are relatively stable, similar to what we saw last quarter. We do believe that we have seen the worst and that these markets have leveled off, albeit at a much, much lower level of activity.", "At the moment, we anticipate more of the same in Q4. We expect to begin seeing some signs of a pick up in 2010, and the comparisons will certainly get easier then. Let me mention that certain applied markets such as food safety continue to be the bright spot here, as we have seen throughout the year. So, overall no dramatic changes in our key end-markets.", "Now I would like to shift gears and talk about some of the highlights this quarter in our key long-term growth drivers. When you really think about our capabilities, we have an incredible unique combination all-in-one company.", "One, an unmatched breadth of technologies, second, extensive geographic presence and third, the resources that come with size and scale. It's this combination that differentiates us in our space and fuels our prospects for growth. I am excited about continuing our strategy by building on the strength, as well as the solid foundation we have already established.", "Let me give you some examples. First, technology innovation continues to be one of our most important growth drivers. We talked last quarter about the launch of our new Thermo Scientific LTQ Velos mass spectrometry platform, which includes our flagship Velos ion trap and Velos Orbitrap systems.", "I visited the customer, who installed our first Velos system to get his feedback and I can honestly tell you, that he was raving about what this technology is doing for the field of mass spectrometry, especially proteomics. He actually thanked us for developing Velos, because the amount of data in inside is researchers are able to clean from this level of analysis is quite remarkable.", "I am pleased to report that shipments of the new Velos platform since the June introduction at ASMS have been very strong and we expect orders to continue to accelerate, even beyond the introduction of Velos, our Orbitrap platform continues to dominate this market.", "We also focus of strengthening our presence outside of life sciences to more routine applications for our technology, such as food safety and clinical applications.", "The second key growth driver is Asia, where we continue to increase our market leading presence, especially in China and India. Just to remind you we have nearly a 1,000 employees in China today and although we are one of the largest players there in our space, we still have a lot of opportunity for continued growth in the region.", "As I mentioned earlier, we are seeing steady activity in air quality and food safety, some of which is related to government stimulus. During the quarter, our air quality business secured multiple large orders, continuous monitoring stations as part of the China National Air Quality Monitoring Network.", "In food safety, we were awarded for our role and helping Chinese laboratories quickly develop capabilities for detecting Melamine in milk and baby formula. [Quarters] have been very strong for us all year from state and local laboratories that need to comply with food quality standards mandated by Chinese version of the FDA.", "To sum it up, we were pleased to report revenue growth in the high-teens in China during Q3, despite of very difficult comparison with the year-ago period.", "The third important element of our growth plan is our ability to make strategic acquisitions that complement our broad portfolio of technologies, the most recent being our additional of B.R.A.H.M.S. AG, a leading provider of specialty in-vitro diagnostic tests. The business is based in Berlin with 2008 revenues of about $105 million and approximately 400 employees.", "B.R.A.H.M.S. tests are based on patented biomarkers for diagnosing various infections and disease. It's a very exciting business, probably best known today for its premier product, Procalcitonin or PCT, which is a biomarker for the early detection of sepsis.", "Sepsis is a life-threatening condition, in which a patient's bloodstream is overtaken by bacteria. The PCT test has become the gold standard in Europe, and with recent FDA clearance, we plan to extend its use for the US market through our extensive channels here.", "By leveraging our diagnostic sales force and our healthcare market catalog, we have the ability to grow this business at a very rapid pace, with little incremental investment in commercial infrastructure.", "B.R.A.H.M.S. also has a robust pipeline of proprietary biomarker tests in development for various heart conditions as well as neurological disorders. Let me remind you that our goal in diagnostics is not to compete with the broad suppliers, but to pick the specialty segment with attractive margins where we can be the clear leader and B.R.A.H.M.S. is perfectly into that strategy.", "I'll also mention here that our integration of Biolab, the leading laboratory channel in Australia and New Zealand is going very well, since we completed that acquisition in Q2. This is a great example of our strategy to expand geographically in this part of our business.", "To wrap up, let me give you an update on our guidance for 2009, which we\u2019ve refined now that we\u2019re in the last quarter of the year. We are raising the midpoint of our annual revenue guidance and narrowing the range to $9.95 billion to $10.05 billion, which would be a decline of 4% to 5% from our 2008 results. This includes the negative effect of currency exchange and also includes the B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition.", "We are also raising the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance and narrowing the range by $0.15 to a new range of $2.95 to $3.05, which would lead to a 3% to 6% decrease from our 2008 results of $3.13.", "So to summarize, I feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made this year, especially our ability to return to adjusted EPS growth in spite of the top-line pressure. Sales of consumables are growing again. This along with the prudent actions we\u2019ve taken to control costs positions us well to meet our financial goals for the year.", "With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call to Pete Wilver, our CFO, for his detailed reviews of the financials. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, our operating performance again improved significantly in the third quarter, despite continuing difficult economic conditions that affected our year-over-year comparisons. We\u2019re especially pleased to have delivered positive growth and adjusted EPS in the quarter, reporting $0.78 in adjusted EPS or 4% growth compared to $0.75 last year. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.53, up from $0.50 in the prior year\u2019s quarter.", "Moving on to the details of our financial results, reported revenues in Q3 declined 2% year-over-year to $2.53 billion. Organic revenues also declined 2% in the quarter, excluding foreign currency translation of negative 2% and positive 2% from acquisitions.", "Our results in Q3 continued our trend of good sequential improvement in organic revenue growth, driven primarily by mid single-digit organic growth in consumables. Bookings in the quarter were essentially inline with revenues.", "By segment, Analytical Technologies' Q3 revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 4% organically. In the quarter demand across our instrumentation businesses, particularly those serving industrial markets continue to be weak, although we did see sequential improvement over the second quarter.", "On a further positive note, our Specialty Diagnostics and Biosciences business had solid growth and new products continue to drive growth, specifically in our scientific instruments product line as Marc mentioned in his comments.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q3 revenues grew 1% on both the reported and organic basis. During the quarter, we saw consumables growth return to prerecession levels. This was partially offset by continued weakness in our routine laboratory equipment business, although the year-over-year declines slowed from what we saw in Q2.", "Looking at organic revenue growth by geography, Asia-Pac grew in the low single-digits against the very tough comparison of growth in the mid-teens last year. Both North America and Europe declined at about the company average, and the rest of the world declined high single-digits against a very tough comparison of almost 40% growth in the prior year.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, Q3 decreased 4% year-over-year to $437 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.3%, down from 17.5% in the year ago quarter, but the good news is that the decline was just 20 basis points.", "The year-over-year margin contraction resulted primarily from pull-through on the organic volume decline at marginal rates, partially offset by favorable pricing actions, strong cost controls and infrastructure reduction actions as well as our global sourcing and practical process improvement efforts.", "Adjusted operating margin again showed considerable improvement sequentially, up 50 basis points from Q2, as revenue strengthened and our cost reduction actions continue to take hold.", "By segment, Analytical Technologies Q3 adjusted operating income decreased by 11% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 19.9%, down a 120 basis points versus 21.1% last year. Laboratory Products and Services Q3 adjusted operating income increased by 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, up 40 basis points versus 14% in the 2008 quarter.", "Moving to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 41.2% in Q3, up 10 basis points from the year ago quarter. This was primarily result of increased prices and our global sourcing and cost reduction initiatives partially offset by the impact of lower volume.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.5% of revenue in Q3, up 30 basis points from 21.2% in the year ago quarter as cost controls and cost reduction actions were offset by negative volume leverage and slightly higher stock-compensation expense.", "R&D expense was 2.4% of revenue in Q3, flat with last year. We intend to maintain our spending level for technology development consistent with 2008 to ensure that we preserve our new product pipeline to drive future growth.", "During Q3, we maintained our program of tight discretionary cost controls and have continued to implement infrastructure cost reduction projects consistent with the plan we laid out at our May Analyst Meeting.", "As we commented last quarter, these actions are focused on the portions of the business that are most directly affected by the economic downturn or where we would like to reduce our manufacturing footprint. We continue to invest in our key growth opportunities to ensure we are positioned to emerge from the recession, as an even stronger industry leader.", "Moving below the line, our Q3 adjusted net interest expense increased $2 million year-over-year to $27 million, as a much less favorable interest income environment more than offset a $600 million reduction in our net debt. Other income was a gain of $1 million, up $3 million from last year, primary as a result of lower currency transaction losses on foreign entity cash.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20% flat with Q2 and down three points from Q3 2008. The lower tax rate versus last year resulted primarily from the tax planning that we implemented during the second half of 2008, and, so far, this year along with lower overall pre-tax income, particularly in high tax jurisdictions.", "Average diluted shares were 420 million in the quarter, down 18 million from last year. The lower share count reflects the benefit of our share buyback programs in 2008 and 2009, as well as lower convertible dilution resulting from a lower stock price.", "Our cash flow performance remains very strong. Year-to-date, free cash flow from continuing ops exceeded $1 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $116 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up a $194 million versus 2008, primarily as a result of lower working capital.", "We ended the quarter with $1.76 billion in cash and investments, up $330 million from Q2, primarily as a result of our free cash flow. Our total debt was $2.02 billion, essentially flat with Q2. Shortly after quarter end, we closed down the B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition, which we funded with 450 million of our European cash. We also assumed about $30 million of debt.", "With regard to working capital, we had a good performance in the quarter, given the economic climate. Account receivable day sales outstanding was 53 days, down one day from the prior year and flat with Q2 and inventory days of supply was 71 days, down three days from the prior year and down two days sequentially from Q2.", "Moving on to our 2009 guidance, we\u2019re raising the midpoint and narrowing our reported revenue guidance from a range of $9.80 billion to $10.10 billion to a range of $9.95 billion to $10.05 billion. The increase in the midpoint from our previous guidance is primarily as a result of more favorable foreign currency translation and the addition of the B.R.A.H.M.S acquisition.", "Our guidance assumes present foreign currency exchange rates, which are negatively affecting our reported revenue growth guidance by about 2%, but also assumes about 1.5% net growth from past acquisitions and divestitures.", "This new range represents a decline of 4% to 5% compared to our 2008 reported revenues of $10.5 billion. On an organic basis, our new full year revenue guidance translates to a decline of about 4%, which remains within the previous guidance range of negative 2% to negative 5%.", "In terms of adjusted EPS, we are raising the low end of our previous guidance by $0.10 and lowering the high end by $0.05, resulting in a higher midpoint and a much narrower range of $2.95 to $3.05, compared to our previous guidance range of $2.85 to $3.10. This range represents a 3% to 6% decline compared to our 2008 adjusted EPS of $3.13.", "In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2009 playing out. Outcomes above and below the midpoint will be dependent upon the relative strength of the economic recovery and the magnitude of incremental stimulus revenues that we are able to convert by year end.", "As always, our guidance does not include any other significant assumptions with regard to potential future acquisitions, share buybacks or other uses of capital.", "In summary, we have been delivering strong sequential improvement in our operating performance through the year, which positions us well to achieve our 2009 financial goals. We continue to believe for striking the right balance between cost reductions and strategic investments, and as a result are well-position to emerge in this period as an even stronger industry leader.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank", "I want to start off by saying congrats, Marc on the new position. I speak for broad audience given the e-mail flow; you did pretty well on your first official conference call. In terms of the commentary, it seems like the general theme is stability to improvement across most of the end market.", "So, I guess certainly these were good numbers and the consumables being up, where they were. It is pretty encouraging going forward. So, I guess the key point at least that I'm focused on is the trajectory of more of the equipment and instrumentation businesses. If we look to other reports across the third quarter, it seems like a lot of the early cycle companies are starting to see some general interest.", "How far do you think you lag across the different businesses and wherever you start to see activity first? So that the commentary on some of the industrial market isn't very, very slow or slight improvement as opposed to more significant and in turn how do you the activity you\u2019re seeing of the order rates or whatever the sales force is saying. How is that comparing to the last cycle we came out of, I know its tough because this was a much deeper decline, but I'm just trying to get a sense for, where you think we are and when you think we'll have more visibility to an improvement and what business units we'll see at first?", "Marc Casper", "As I think about the industrial end markets and the focus on the capital equipment side of things, clearly these are segments from an economic cycle that are going to lag by at least a couple of quarters. So, you need to be in a strengthening economy and then you start to see the effects of capital flow into these types of products in our instrumentation and then especially both instrumentation that are related to capacity expansion.", "So, they definitely a lagging general economic cycle and that we've known over the many, many years in one of these businesses. When we look at that today, clearly we see the fourth quarter looking very similar to the third quarter in terms of low levels of activity. The comparisons get easier in 2010, but right now we are not forecasting a very robust economy.", "So, you are going to have easier comparisons, but we are still waiting for more GDP-driven economic growth to really drive that demand. As and everything, there were certain applied market that are doing well. Food safety has been the nice driver for us even in the difficult environment. Around the world we've seen a lot of demand in that area.", "More broadly in our instrumentation business, mass spectrometry as I mentioned in my prepared remarks continues to do well despite the fact that those are high priced in terms of ticket prices for those instruments often selling at a $0.5 million. We've had very good demand for them, because the innovation there is just so incredibly profound. So from that perspective, a few bright spots, but we're looking at certainly not until 2010 to see easier comparisons in the industrial customer base.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "With respect to just maybe a higher level, we see more acquisition-based strategies showing up like Agilent and Danaher coming into this space. Marc, from a high level, what are some of the challenges that you see as Thermo for the next few years and with respect to like M&A? Then kind of as a follow-up to that, tell us a little bit about B.R.A.H.M.S and what attracted you to that segment?", "Marc Casper", "So as I look at the acquisition landscape, which has clearly accelerated over the last couple of quarters, I think it's probably useful to say first how do we think about M&A and how do we evaluate M&A and then talk more about the broader landscape.", "When you look at our M&A strategy, the first thing that we look at is, does doing an acquisition strengthen the company's offering for our customers? Does adding a capability make a meaningful difference for our customers?", "If the answer is clearly, yes, to that question, we come to the second question, which is of very, very significant importance, which is, can we generate significant shareholder returns on that use of capital?", "If the answer to that is, you then come down to the question of availability and those things, but we use a filter. We don\u2019t need to get bigger for the sense of bigger, but we do look at deals actively to strengthen our company\u2019s offering to our customers and generate returns for our shareholders. So that\u2019s the high level view.", "B.R.A.H.M.S fits very, very well within those criteria. We have an excellent set of capabilities in specialty diagnostics. We have leadership positions in the niches that we play. We have incredible reach to the market through our direct sales force, through our OEM relationships, through our healthcare channel business.", "When you look at B.R.A.H.M.S., they have not only a product that\u2019s going to be commercialized in the US after building a nice set of momentum in Europe and we have incredible reach to the market, but they have a very attractive R&D pipeline with their biomarkers, which gives us not only the ability to generate short to mid-term growth but also to have long-term growth from that acquisitions. So we feel very good about an acquisition like B.R.A.H.M.S.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of UBS. Please proceed.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Pete, did you comment on the equipment organic revenue growth rate and, I guess, could you differentiate between the industrial and life sciences growth of businesses?", "Peter Wilver", "We didn\u2019t say what the equipment growth rate was, but it certainly is better than Q2. In Q2, we reported mid-teens decline and it was more like high single-digit decline, in Q3. So, it improved as well as the consumables. I don't really have a differentiation between the industrial versus the life science, but certainly the industrial getting hit a lot harder on the life sciences side.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "I guess one other question like on the equipment space. You commented on the mass spec shipments in the quarter, were all those recognized during the quarter that you shipped?", "Marc Casper", "When you look at, when we say shipments, those will be recognized.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "I think some of your competitors have been coming on the Orbitrap, then that is going after with some of the new products launches. Could you talk about what you\u2019re seeing the dynamics in end market, is there pricing pressure? I guess, I was pretty taken by the comment that you felt like half of the stimulus grants on mass spec, that were using mass spec (inaudible). Could you just give us a little bit of more color on that comment, in terms of how you get that and just the overall pricing environment, what you\u2019re seeing in the competitive landscape in that space?", "Marc Casper", "As you look first of all, we had a very exciting launches at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry conference in June. That translated in to very quick pickup in bookings and ultimately shipments because the product was ready to go and that helped our results in the quarter that we just reported.", "Really within those orders and shipments, there was nothing that came from stimulus in those numbers, so that's a positive on the horizon. Our view on that is probably more meaningful in 2010 than in the fourth quarter. We've done surveys. We have read surveys. We talk to our customers. We've written and helped write a lot of grants. So, we have a pretty good sense of what's going on in the mass spectrometry landscape.", "When you look at the number of grants written, about half it appears were written around our technology. So, we feel good about that and we feel good about the fact that our customers even the [early read] is that the technology is so profound that even those customers pre-stimulus money is actually going out and buying these product. So we always, we keep a close eye on the competition. We've got good tough competitors, but the [early read] is not a surprise to us, which is our product looks to be very, very well received in the market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Maybe just a question on the consumable performance, I mean, obviously, you've seen some good strength here sequentially throughout the year. Can you just comment on how much of this is, is market related versus share shift and also maybe if you can add some comment about mix whether you\u2019re emphasizing consumables a little bit more? I think based on your comments on the top 20 pharma or biopharma accounts, it seems like obviously you\u2019re pulling a lot of shares. So, just wondering if that\u2019s accelerated in the past couple quarters?", "Marc Casper", "When you look at the consumable performance, we clearly had strengthening in the hospital customer base. Part of that is driven by preparation for H1N1 and that helps both microbiology and our healthcare businesses. We also saw a strength within biopharma customers, particularly in both our life science research, reagents as well as our BioProcess, media and plastic containers, sterile containers, if you will.", "So we saw a nice pickup in both biopharma and hospitals. We are not emphasizing consumables more than capital equipment. So, it\u2019s less flat and consumables are more reflective that activity is starting to pick up at the customer level, but the capital budgets still remain tight.", "Peter Wilver", "The one other data point is flu came in significant stronger than we had expected. We picked up almost $20 million in revenue incremental year-over-year in flu in Q3. So, obviously, that was a nice benefit to the organic growth rate.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Then just on the acquisition question you had before. Is it fair to assume diagnostics are going to continue to be kind of a focus area given B.R.A.H.M.S and your comments previously?", "Marc Casper", "As you look at the company, we like our growth platforms, the six growth platforms that we have very much, and that's our customer channels and our lab products and services, as well as biopharma service, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics and bioscience reagents. So I think you should look at us not favoring one of our six children more than another if you will, but looking at the right things to strengthen our offering.", "We really do like those businesses. There was a great opportunity in specialty diagnostics. So, we made a meaningful acquisition last quarter, but the quarter before when we brought Biolab was a great acquisition for our customer channels business and has a same type of rationale of strengthening our competitiveness and we made a move there.", "Larger deals are clearly going to be focused on analytical instruments, bioscience, the specialty diagnostics, the bolt-on would be more in the lab products and services if you want to think about size of transactions. You are going to see larger emphasis if they become available on the higher tech portion of our company.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie. Please proceed.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just a follow-up on the consumable question, that was actually where I was going to go. The flu obviously is maybe not repeatable, hospitals were severely destocking until the first six months of the year, so there is some restocking going on. So I guess question is, how confident are you that this kind of getting back to average or above average growth of north of 5% is sustainable?", "Marc Casper", "When we look at the hospital portion and whole flu side for a moment, we don\u2019t believe that there was a big restocking activity that went on in the period but more representative of usage, Jon, in terms of what happened. A number of our team went out and talked to customers about what they are doing, including me going to a couple of our large customers and let\u2019s say, what was going on from the behavioral standpoint. Clearly, they took inventory levels down, but nobody is in a rush to rebuild inventory.", "I don\u2019t expect that really to happen in a meaningful way at any point in time. I think customers are just going to expect suppliers to meet their needs and not have to carry buffers on site. So that\u2019s what I think about that issue.", "In terms of sustainability, our view on flu is that the fourth quarter is likely to be at least comparable to last year which was a strong flu quarter, if not better, because you have two different strains of flu going on out there. So that should be a continuation and then obviously, it\u2019s hard to predict what it means for the future getting beyond Q4 in terms of what flu represents.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So year-over-year, if I were to extrapolate, it would be, you don\u2019t really see restocking more usage related. The flu obviously is a bit of a wild card, but, on the other, you think it is more, you\u2019re kind of stabilizing at this level in terms of usage and it\u2019s not necessary that restocking that\u2019s going on in the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "I did.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Then, Pete, service revenue has actually been more mechanized under the radar in terms of growth. I know it\u2019s actually been kind of weak. Did you see any improvement there in terms of may be some utilization coming back online or what\u2019s going on in the service revenues?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. Actually, service revenue was probably the one low point in the quarter. We saw mid-single-digits decline in service versus low single digits in the first and second quarter. So it actually deteriorated a little bit, some of that was just a tougher comp in Q3. The areas of weakness were really the industrial side of our equipment business. Those service revenues are particularly weak right now.", "We are also seeing little bit of reluctance on the part of our biopharma customers to do large outsourcing projects, which is impacting some of our biopharma services business. So I think this is not necessarily indicative of our new trend here, it\u2019s probably one of the weakest data point we expect to see, but certainly a little bit of a disappointment for us this quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "So a few questions, lot of questions on consumables. I just wanted to confirm one point here. Last quarter you guys had talked about things getting better throughout the quarter on the consumable side. So, is that 5% number you talked about, is that sort of stabilizing here and was that sort of consistent through the quarter or were things still improving?", "Marc Casper", "I would say consistent through the quarter when we were doing investor conferences in about a month ago. Our view then is pretty much our view now is. What we saw throughout the quarter was pretty consistent and that resulted in a 5% roughly organic growth for consumables.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Then second question is when you start to think about next year, cost cutting and furlough programs you guys have put in place. How much do you guys think if things start to get better next year, both organically and then also just on comps I guess too. To what extent, are you guys happy with where the cost structure is now and sort of how much upside will can we think about flowing through from the big picture perspective versus places you guys feel like you\u2019ve held back and then want to reinvest as we said the thing about 2010?", "Marc Casper", "I think we are happy with the cost structure for the level of revenue that we are at today. The wild card for 2010 is obviously things like you just said the furloughs and some of the more discretionary type cost controls, which are durable in the short-term, but long-term you can't just cut out all travel and those types of things. So some of that is going to come back into the P&L in 2010, assuming that we have even really if stay at the revenue levels that we are today.", "So we are going to get some headwind from that. In terms of investing incrementally to that, I think it will in synch with what we see in terms of revenue. As revenues start to creep up, we'll reinvest in the areas that we think we need to invest in. So that won't be a drag to the P&L. It will really just be those things that were sort of artificial in 2009.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "In anyway you can quantify that or sort of help us to think about how much of the headwind that is?", "Peter Wilver", "In terms of the discretionary and the furloughs, it\u2019s probably something in the range of 30 to 40 basis points of headwind depending on how that plays out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "So again you guys got a stimulus benefits to about $100 million to $200 million over the next 12 months. It sounds like that's a worldwide number. Any chance you would give us any details on what you think the US contribution can be? I guess as part of the question or part of answering the question, could you may be talk about what of that is instruments and infrastructure versus consumables?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of the details of that number, that that's obviously a very, very high level number and at this point, we don't have it at that level of detail in terms of the forecast. It is very difficult even on an actual basis to know what those numbers are.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Would it be fair to assume that maybe it\u2019s a with all easier to take a look at instruments and infrastructure and that the consumable side is a little more squishy because it takes a little longer to flow through?", "Marc Casper", "Certainly, the equipment and instrument side of the equation is pretty easily identifiable, but the other piece is pretty tough.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "We\u2019ve talked about this a few times already, but you guys had a good consumables quarter. I was wondering if there was potentially any negative impact on consumables in the quarter from having a late Labor Day, especially on the research side? Maybe I can just ask one cleanup and I'll get back in the queue as a follow-up, what were the days comparisons in the third quarter and what does that look like in the fourth quarter? Thank you.", "Marc Casper", "Sure. In the third quarter, the days were the same as last year, so no impact and we don\u2019t believe that the late Labor Day had any material impact on the numbers. In Q4, we pick up a one day year-over-year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "I just wanted to think a little bit for a minute about the longer-term opportunities for Thermo as you kind of take the helm here. Specifically looking at expansion of overseas, distribution and assets, that's been a theme this year, I'm wondering in terms of your M&A activity. I'm wondering if you see any specific emerging markets where making cross-border type acquisitions are particularly challenging versus others, and, as a result, how does that inform you plans to sort of to grow the business on a build versus buy approach?", "Marc Casper", "As we look at our expansion geographically, we always start with the build versus buy and which is going to generate the best shareholder returns you\u2019re often trading off a time to market versus a large upfront capital outlay on a relative basis. We do that trade-off each case and then you also look at the environmental, and say, if you wanted to do a buy strategy to jump start growth, are there available assets that could really help you and is the environment that felt good about it.", "We have been comfortable doing some M&A in India in terms of how we\u2019ve approached it and we brought some good companies that have helped us there. Obviously, we\u2019re comfortable in Australia and New Zealand and we\u2019ve done the same small deal in Malaysia. So there\u2019ve been a number of markets that we have gone in and out. There are also market that we have been much more of develop at yourself.", "China is an example where very dramatic investments are building our infrastructure in terms of make versus buy. We\u2019ve supplemented a lot of our acquisitions and India was very heavy investments to build our capabilities. In a country like Ireland, certainly not Asia, we chose to do a make strategy and really build out our presence there from the ground up.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Then if you think about the relative opportunity in the long run for India, obviously China has been a great market for you, but I\u2019m wondering does India present the same type of opportunity over the long run, given the footprint maybe in the generic field and maybe future growth biosimilars, that kind of thing or do you see still China is sort of your larger opportunity?", "Marc Casper", "I think both are very significant opportunities for the company. They have different emphasis points. India is clearly much more of a life science orientation to what our business is developing to be and China is much more balanced in terms of having a reasonably high industrial safety quality focus. So you also have life science demand, but you also have a lot of demand for things like quality monitoring, process instruments, portable analyzers, lot of infrastructure support and quality support.", "So in a way it's growing a little bit more quickly, because you are firing on more cylinders than just life sciences, but we are very excited about the long-term prospects for India because of the life science investment, that's clearly going to go on there.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Last question, I'll ask here is on the mass spec side. Some of your major competitors are influx right now with M&A deals they are trying to close and you mentioned the strength that your are seeing in Orbitrap Velos for non-stimulus type customer. So I'm wondering if you see a meaningful opportunity to pick up some market share at least in the near-term in that business?", "Marc Casper", "We have a very good offering. We have a terrific team. We have a great set of technologies and a loyal set of customers, and I think that positions us well in our mass spec business and we also have tough competitors and we wake up everyday and make sure that we are running our business the best we possible can to make sure that our customer select our products versus the competitors out there. So we certainly try to gain share. We feel good about our technology, but we never underestimate the tough competition that's out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson of Thomas Weisel Partners.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Just wondering if you can talk about how you are going to run the company differently, what things you are going to emphasize more or less versus Marijn and kind of the plans for the first year?", "Marc Casper", "It's a good question and it's one that a month ago or so when I went out on the first road show, first announcements kind of a lot of time talking about I think it's worthwhile repeating some of the themes that I communicated at one of the conferences.", "The first of which is that Marijn, Pete and I have worked together very closely for the last eight years in developing and executing the company strategy, and certainly Pete and I feel great ownership as the rest of the leadership team and our strategy has been the world leader in serving science and the growth drivers that come with us. So from a strategic perspective, we feel very comfortable with this direction, with feel great ownership in developing that strategy and executing against it.", "When you look what are we trying to accomplish? We obviously want to leverage those unique capabilities to grow our business and continue to gain strength with our customers. We're very focused on Asia. We're very focused on innovation, that's two areas, but those were focuses that we had in the past. So I think that in these markets that are very important to continue to focus on and we will.", "When I look at changes probably the one change I'll just do a quick uptick because there was question that was more difficult to answer a month ago, and the transition which is, what happened to the Chief Operating Officer position that I have filled and in that particular case, I chose not to replace that position given the strength of our leadership team that we have in the company.", "Most of our investors have had exposure in our annual analyst meeting to our group presidents and members of our management team and our group presidents and the rest of the leadership team will be picking up those responsibilities as the Chief Operating Officer. That's really the only change that I would say has happened in a meaningful way since the last interaction with investors, but the strategy is one that we're very energized by.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Marc, you previously kind of mentioned, the business has been bouncing along the bottom, have we moved beyond that now?", "Marc Casper", "No, I think, I didn't use the exact same words but I had the exact same meaning. When you look at the industrial side of the business which is where I was focusing those comments, that's where we feel we are. Early in the year you had this continued deceleration of the business, it stabilized, it continues to be stable but at much, much lower levels of activity. So we feel like that is bouncing along the bottom.", "As we look to Q4, as I mentioned earlier, we feel like it's going to be the same and then which you wind up having is that the comparisons get easier. So even if demand doesn't necessarily change much, you wind up just reporting better sets of numbers just because of the comparison.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Rob Hawkins with Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "If we can I would like just maybe parse some of your comments related to NIH stimulus the 100 million and 200 million, from comments made by you and others related to typical academic budget. For 2009 a lot of these guys in prior quarters were hoarding their cash, waiting kind to see what happen with the stimulus and holding off on purchases. Now that this first kind of wave of (inaudible), now what's your thought, I mean are we going to see kind of a big rush to spend money here in the fourth quarter, where are you guys thinking about that and do you think that's going to help instruments I mean and maybe how that might play out?", "Marc Casper", "We're dealing with many, many customers and many, many brands, it\u2019s hard to totally generalize, but our view is that customers aren't going to rush out. They have [dead loans] and when they have to spend the money, so it's not as if they can sit on the money for ever. But our view is that in the tougher environment where endowments are tough and customers are worried about where they are funding sources are, they are going to be thoughtful about how they spend their money. They are obviously going to follow what they wrote in their brands and our belief is that we'll see some flow of funds in Q4, based on the discussions we've had, but that is going to pick up more meaningfully in 2010 particularly in the first half of 2010. That's our best read as of today.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). You have a follow-up question from the line of Rob Hawkins. Please proceed.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Can we talk a little bit then about the B.R.A.H.M.S. and the sepsis kits? You\u2019re going to do this by a reference lab and then you have these other products. Have you guys kind of disclosed the timeline maybe for some of the CV and these other products in terms of a broad timeline in terms of when maybe some of these things might be approved?", "Marc Casper", "No. I think when we thought about the acquisition and the price that we paid and the returns we generated, we made an assumption that effectively you get nothing from the pipeline, not that we believe that but that we believe that we can commercialize what has been cleared by the FDA and generate appropriate returns based on that. We\u2019re very excited about the pipeline that happens, but it\u2019s very hard to speculate on where those go through regulatory processes and I don\u2019t think we would expect to have anything meaningful in terms of revenue from that in the near future.", "However, you may see some launches of those products as they go through regulatory clearance, maybe even in the near term, just to develop markets and those things. So view of that is more of a discussion, probably late 2010 to give you an outlook on that for future years, not something that\u2019s going to have any impact on the next year or so.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Right, thanks. Great color.", "Marc Casper", "So let me make a couple of closing comments. First of all, we are pleased with our steady improvements in revenue and operating performance, as the year has progressed. We are also more excited than ever about our long-term growth prospects. Thanks to our continued investments in technology, global expansion and complementary acquisition. Thanks for listening today. We look forward to reporting our year end results on our next call. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you for joining today\u2019s conference. This concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

(Operator Instructions).  I would now like to turn the call over to Eileen Pattinson, head of investor relations for Life Technologies.  Please proceed, ma'am.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Good morning, everyone.  Welcome to Life Technologies third quarter 2009 earnings conference call.  Joining me on the call today as speakers are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO and David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer.  In addition, we have Mark Stevenson, President and Chief Operating Officer and Bernd Brust, Chief Commercial Officer joining us for Q&A.", "If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you can obtain one from our Web site at lifetechnologies.com.  Before we begin, I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statement including but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company.", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated.  It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures.  A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our Web site.  For today's call, we'll be referencing a presentation that you can view on line.  Instructions to access the Web cast are on our Web site.  ", "Additionally, we will be posting the presentation to our Web site upon the conclusion of this conference call.  Greg will begin today's call with highlights of the third quarter and an update on our integration progress.  He'll be followed by David, who will give a more detailed review of the company's third quarter operating results and 2009 expectations.  I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen, and good morning everyone.  This quarter we continue the momentum we've had all year resulting in another strong quarter of revenue growth, operating income and free cash flow.  In aggregate, our customers speak with our wallets and demonstrate how essential our products are to their all-important work.", "Aside from the importance our products play in the work of scientists, our success is centered around sound operating rigor and demonstrated execution abilities.  I'll go into more detail on the specific initiatives that we accomplished within the quarter, but first let me start with an overview of the financial results we released this morning.", "In Q3, revenue grew 3% to $805 million.  Excluding the impact from currency and the divested LIMS business unit, organic revenue growth for the quarter was 5%.  Consistent with previous quarters, this growth was a result of year-over-year increases in both instrument and consumable sales.", "Gross margin was a robust 67%, slightly higher than the previous year and a result of further integration related savings and continued positive price realization.  We had another impressive quarter of operating margin expansion resulting in an ending operating margin of 27.3%, a 290 basis point improvement.", "Operating income improved 15% or 20% excluding the impact of currency.  All of this resulted in non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.73 and free cash flow of $164 million.", "I think it's important to note that these results exceeded our own expectations for several reasons.  First, the quarter started out fairly light from the revenue perspective in July but gained significant momentum as time progressed.", "Given the slow start, we took measures to reduce non-revenue generating expenses.  These cost measures resulted in meaningful operating expense declines quarter-over-quarter.  A good portion of these expenses were project related and will, therefore, be spent in the coming quarters.", "As I do each quarter, let me now give you an update on our strategic objectives for the year, growing our core business, flawlessly executing on our integration plan and investing for future growth.", "Focusing on our core business simply means providing our customers each and every day with the highest quality, the most innovative products and services that make Life Technologies such an integral, essential part of life science research, forensics and bio-production.", "To that end, it is critical that we have a strong research funnel and development pipeline and that we support these technologies with the most robust commercialization effort.", "I believe the management of this business equation is what has matured the most in the last three years of our company, and that our organic growth today is as much driven by launching new products as it by price and volume.", "To that end, this period we launch a plethora of new reagents and several cutting-edge systems such as the magic bench top device that simplifies and automates the sample preparation process for protein and nucleic acid separation.  Additionally, we released the BenchPro Western Processor, a completely automated solution to Western blotting.", "We also continue to make advances in our commercialization efforts.  For example, in the third quarter, we added selected AB reagents to our Invitrogen sales team's responsibility.  We had a record number of online orders through our e-commerce channels, with 70% of all North American orders processed across the Web.", "In addition, we launched the Cell Resource Center, a Web portal that is the industry's first comprehensive online resource for cell biology information and technology, as well as added functionality to our Web site for chat and ratings and reviews.", "Our Web site has been rated number one by our customers for the past several years and has proven to be an important element to achieving customer loyalty and consistent revenue growth.  With this channel now approaching almost $1 billion in revenue, we plan to continue to invest vigorously.", "And finally by focusing on our core it means we periodically pause and ask if we're in the right businesses.  You will recall that in September we announced plans to sell our stake in our mass spectrometry joint venture to Danaher Corporation for $450 million.", "Danaher also signed an agreement to acquire our partner in the J.V., MDS Analytical Technology.  MDS shareholders have now approved the MDS portion of the sale and, as such, we expect to close this transaction in the fourth quarter.", "Our teams have worked diligently in the last two months to ensure a smooth transfer of the business to Danaher and limit disruptions to our customers.  As evidenced by a strong financial result, our core business focus is paying off.  There's no letting up in our work to deliver to our customers the very best products, services and support.", "As to our second strategic objective, flawless execution of our integration plans, we continue to do very well.  As you can see from our integration scorecard tracker, all areas of the project remain on track.  We announced last quarter that our integration efforts have gone so well that we now expect to achieve $95 million in synergy realization in 2009, $15 million more than original expectation.", "Today I'm pleased to report that we've already put in place actions to achieve $90 million of savings by the end of the year and the remainder to come is in the fourth quarter.  This is another indication of how well our plans have gone, and once again, I'd like to thank everyone involved with the integration efforts for all their hard work and dedication.", "As we said last quarter, our integration leader Mark Smedley and his dedicated team of resources are also responsible for transitioning our mass spectrometry business to Danaher and, therefore, we expect the transition to go smoothly.", "In early July, we began to further integrate our product offerings by adding 1,400 Applied Biosystems SKUs in Invitrogen sales channels.  Enhancements to our systems to support new pricing, quoting, invoicing and distribution processes for these SKUs were completed by the end of the quarter.", "We've seen a modest revenue benefit from these actions thus far, and expect to see an acceleration in revenue synergy capture over the next few quarters now.  Customer feedback on the addition of the products to the Invitrogen Web site and the dual-branded supply centers has been strong and overall, the effort is going smoothly.", "The final focus area for us in 2009 and beyond is to make investments to fuel future growth.  We see enormous potential for our business to make significant impact in the areas of personalized medicine, regenerative science, synthetic biology and companion diagnostics in the months and the years to come.", "To do so effectively, we must invest both by ramping up our R&D efforts, as well as by making wise external investment and technology acquisitions.  Our commitment to furthering innovation in advanced genomics technologies is a great example of how we continue to invest in the growth of our company.", "During the recent ASHG conference last week, we announced the commercialization of SOLiD 3 Plus, an upgraded platform offering higher through-put, shorter run times, more cost effective reagents and new software to make data analysis easier and shorter.", "This upgraded platform along with the newly launched 3500 Series Genetic Analyzer, a system that sets new standards for through-put, data quality and ease of use, we see once again we're able to provide scientists with improved platforms and methods to advance research in this important field, furthering our goal of becoming the premier provider of life science tools for our customers.", "Many of you have heard me say before that to be a great company we must also be a good one.  I truly believe that it's our responsibility to give back to the communities in which we reside and reduce our negative impact to our environment.", "To that end, we have made some major accomplishments in Q3 that I would like to highlight today.  In the area of philanthropy, the Life Technologies Foundation made nearly $2 million in grants this quarter.  By the end of the year, the foundation is on track to award approximately $5 million to organizations that advance scientific education and promote activities that use biology to improve human life.", "In Q3, we were also recognized for our global citizenship and sustainability efforts.  Life Technologies was named for the second year in a row to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index, which recognizes leadership in business, environmental and social issues.", "We were also named in Newsweek magazine as one of America's greenest companies.  I could not be more proud of our initiatives to reduce our impact on the environment.  As they say, going green makes green.  Our work to reduce waste, energy usage, and our carbon footprint also makes us ever more efficient.", "One final note before I hand the call over to David, as many of you already know, there has been a recent change in our investor relations group.  Amanda Clardy, who has led the IR team since 2006, has been named the chief marketing officer for the company and as such will be transitioning out of her role at investor relations.", "Her terrific leadership has helped build a greater investor relations team that will now be led by Eileen Pattinson.  Eileen joined Invitrogen in 2005 and since that time has held various leadership positions within the finance organization.  ", "I would like to thank Amanda for all her efforts leading investor relations activities for the past three years and welcome Eileen into her role.  Under Amanda's watch, our stock has risen 146% to where it is today, and now we're counting on Eileen to do the same.  No pressure, Eileen.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thanks.", "Greg Lucier", "I will now hand the call over to David and he'll give you more details on our financial results for the quarter.", "David Hoffmeister", "", "This quarter, we grew revenue 3% to $805 million.  Excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, revenue grew 5% organically.  We're clearly pleased with this level of organic growth, especially given our expectations going into the quarter.", "There are a couple of items to note.  First, our H1N1 related product revenue was roughly equivalent to Q2 levels at approximately $14 million.  We didn't anticipate revenue this high, but we're pleased that our 7500 Fast and Fast Dx Real-Time PCR instruments remain the standard for accurate, timely detection of the flu virus and now serve as the de facto standard for global H1N1 surveillance.", "The other item to note is that our royalty revenue, which was expected to decline in the range of $12 million to $15 million in Q3, only declined by approximately $7 million.  This is a direct result of our licensing team finding a number of new customers for our intellectual property.", "Most of our business turned in a strong performance for the quarter.  Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 8% organically to $394 million in revenue.  The majority of the H1N1 related products resides in this group and accounted for approximately 4 points of growth for the division.", "Because the H1N1 virus continues to be a very real public health concern, we expect that demand for these products will continue in Q4 at roughly the same levels as we saw in Q3.  Aside from H1N1-related sales, this division also benefited from strong growth in qPCR instruments and reagents and continued growth in our transfection related portfolio of products.", "Genetic Systems had revenue of $216 million, representing 7% organic growth.  Our largest business in this division, CE Research, grew in the low single digits this quarter driven by new instrument sales in the Asia Pacific region and licensing revenue.", "Our Applied Markets business, which includes kits and CE systems, grew in the double digits.  In Japan, we won an order to outfit the entire Japanese police force with our 3130xl CE sequencer.  This is an example of how this gold standard in sequencing continues to have viable markets and growth opportunities today even though it's a technology that's been around for a while.  ", "And finally, we continue to gain traction in Next Generation Sequencing as we improve the usability of the solid platform.  Continuous improvement in the technology along with investments in our service, sales, and marketing are paying off.      ", "Cell Systems had revenues of $189 million, which were flat organically over the same period last year.  This division is a tale of two cities with many of the businesses such as our Dynal beads and stem cells growing in the double digits, offset by a year-over-year decline in our bioproduction business.  We had several bioproduction customers purchase less in the quarter than they previously forecast.", "Our Mass Spec division revenue grew 3% organically to $111 million, driven by growth in all regions outside of North America.  Sales into applied markets remained strong and we are beginning to see some pick up in pharma sales, particularly in China and Europe, which returned to positive growth.", "Year-to-date, organic growth for this division is negative 4% in line with our expectations of flat to down 10% for the year.  In terms of organic growth by region, excluding the Mass Spec division, Europe grew 8%, Asia Pacific 21%, Japan 7% and the Americas grew 1%.", "However, it's important to note that all royalty revenue for the company is accounted for in the America's region.  Without the impact of royalties, the Americas grew 5%.  Currency this quarter reduced revenue growth by approximately 2%, net of our hedging program.  The negative impact to EPS was approximately $0.03, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue, other income, and the Mass Spec venture.  ", "Before I begin with the financial comparisons, let me remind you that we are comparing all of our non-GAAP financial results to the pro-forma income statements that we've posted on our Web site that combined Invitrogen in the AB for all of 2008.", "Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67%, an increase of approximately 20 basis points over prior year.  This improvement was primarily due to synergy realization, improved price, and a reduction in royalty expense.  This was partially offset by lower royalty revenue and currency.  ", "Third quarter operating expenses were $320 million, a decrease of approximately $13 million from prior year levels, as a result of synergy realization and currency.  Sequentially, operating expenses declined by approximately 4% as a result of cost controls implemented early in the quarter.", "Operating income was $220 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency and 20% excluding currency.  Operating margin was 27.3%, representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year, including the impact from currency.", "This level of operating margin expansion resulted primarily from revenue growth, synergy realization, and other operating expense reductions.  In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income and $6 million of income from our Mass Spec joint venture.", "Interest expense for the quarter was $37 million.  This expense does not include the accelerated amortization of issuance costs resulting from the early retirement of debt.  This is an important point to note, as last quarter we stated that these accelerated fees would be expensed at the time of payment and that we would include the amount of the acceleration in our non-GAAP results.", "Upon further review, we've decided that due to the non-recurring and non-cash nature of the fees, we will exclude them from non-GAAP earnings.  In Q3, the impact on GAAP EPS of accelerated amortization of issuance costs resulting from the early retirement of $200 million of debt in the quarter was $0.03.  Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.1%.  We still expect our full year tax rate to be approximately 29.5%.  ", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was $183.4 million.  As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.  Assuming an average share price between $45 and $50, share count in the fourth quarter would be approximately 186 to 188 million shares.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.22, which includes $0.29 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.04 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1, $0.15 per share of Biosystems integration costs in other items, and $0.03 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost.  On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings items per share were $0.73.  ", "Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $580 million.  This compares to last quarter's balance of $583 million.  Cash from operating activities were $200 million.  Capital expenditures were $36 million and free cash flow was $164 million.  ", "Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $3.2 billion.  This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and term loans of $2.1 billion.  ", "We have now paid $275 million of the debt associated with the applied Biosystems acquisition.  As we indicated previously we intend to use the proceeds associated with the divestiture of the mass spec business, which we estimate to be $290 million to further pay down this debt.  In addition to this, we intend to pay down another $100 million late in the fourth quarter.  Total debt repayment for the year will be approximately $665 million.", "In the first three quarters of 2009 revenue increased 6% organically and operating margins have expanded by 300 basis points including the impact from currency.  We feel good about our results thus far, and are now focus on the fourth quarter and working towards finishing out the year.", "With that in mind, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of the year.  We expect fourth quarter organic revenue growth to be in the high single digits.  With that level of organic growth we now expect full-year, non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $2.90 to $2.95.  This guidance includes several items that are important to note.  ", "First, we've included the expected Q4 impact from the NIH stimulus in our forecast.  In Q3 we saw a couple of million dollars of revenue from stimulus funding, mostly in instrumentation, but also in some other areas, such as stem cell research.  As we stated in the past, we expect to see a more meaningful amount of revenue from the stimulus in 2010. ", "As you can imagine the exact size and timing of the stimulus revenue is difficult to project especially since the funds are just beginning to flow to our customers.  With that said, we now believe that we will see revenue of approximately $5 million to $10 million from stimulus funding in the fourth quarter. ", "Second, we expect the divestiture of the mass spec business will be completed in the fourth quarter.  For modeling purposes it's important to note that historically more than half of mass spec revenues and income occur in the third month of the quarter.  ", "Third, our forecast includes a revised estimate of the impact of currency.  In the fourth quarter, we expect currency at today's rates and with our hedging programs to increase growth rates by approximately two percentage points.  ", "With that, let me provide some additional financial details on the coming quarter.  As we noted previously we expect PCR royalty revenue in Q4 will decline by approximately $5 million to $8 million.  Gross margins are expected to be sequentially lower due to lower royalty revenue, lower realized prices and a higher mix of OEM and instrument sales.  ", "Operating expenses will increase sequentially due to a variety of factors including increases in certain project-related costs and the impact of new hires added late in Q3.  In addition, expenses associated with employee stock options granted at the end of September, will appear in the fourth quarter. ", "We expect capital expenditures to ramp up and be in line with our guidance of $175 million to $200 million for the year, including $50 million of integration-related capital.", "Finally, free cash flow for the year is expected to be approximately $500 million.  This is an increase to our previous forecast, which was $475 million.  And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Greg for closing remarks. ", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks David.  As you can see from our results today, we are truly realizing the benefits of the incredibly hard work from our employees and a laser focus on executing our strategic imperatives for the year.  As we continue to strengthen our core business by building on what we do best, creating innovative products for our customers, we are actually changing the way research is done, making it faster, simpler and easier to understand.  ", "The promise of our combined company is really starting to come through, not only financially, but also in the way customers think about us.  We are being approached by clients to take on bigger challenges and bigger projects that could transform science and medicine.  We've never been more encouraged by the future we see.", "With that, I'll hand it over to Eileen for Q&A.", "Eileen Pattinson", "", "Thanks, Greg.  Operator, you can now open the lines for questions.   ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "Thank you.  (Operator Instructions).  Your first question on the line comes from Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hey, good morning.  Congrats on a terrific quarter.  I'm wondering if we could get a little bit more color on the comments you made around pricing.  It sounds like you had some traction this quarter, and then David in your comments you talked about that being a little bit of a headwind in the fourth quarter.  ", "So if you can just kind of, I guess, kind of help us think about how we think about the traction from the additional ABI SKUs, and then how you're thinking about pricing, obviously on a go-forward basis in the next year. ", "Bernd Brust", "", "From a comment here on the fourth quarter, that's more normal around the timing of pricing.  As you know we raise our list price traditionally in the beginning of the year and as we go through the year we just see slight degradation throughout the various quarters, and where that usually Q4 is the lightest in pricing.  But nothing really unusual from we traditionally see.  We believe moving into 2010 that our pricing strategies will continue in the same lines that we've seen in past years.  ", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "Maybe one for Mark on just the positioning of the SOLiD 3 Plus, and if you can help us think about some of the developments for the coming year as well, I know you've talked in the past about automating the upfront sample prep.  If you can talk a little bit more about how you're looking at that \u2013 that'll be helpful, too.", "Mark Stevenson", "", "Virtually on the SOLiD 3 Plus, I mean, we again increased the through-put of the system.  We got up to 30 gigs and actually one of our customers presented data on a 50-gig run during the meeting at ASHG.  So we're really making great progress on through-put and continue to demonstrate great accuracy.  This customer showed finding a result just with this single run.  ", "We're continuing to improve on the software so we introduced new software in that, a Bioscope System.  We're making good progress in also making the front end steps and during the early part of next year we plan to introduce that automation of front sample prep end.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JP Morgan", "And then maybe just one last one for Greg, now that we're coming up on the one year anniversary of the (ABDL), can you just talk about from an infrastructure standpoint where you see the investments going forward between geographic or I know you've talked a little bit about some of the clinical opportunities.  So how do we think about headcount and where you're going to be making the investments in the coming year? ", "Greg Lucier", "Well, let's first talk about headcount.  We'll be adding heads into Asia in 2010 quite aggressively.  Our China business is really flourishing and we'll add a lot more heads in the China both for sales and service and back office capabilities.  We're going to be adding more heads around sequencing.  ", "We're ramping up our R&D efforts on a number of different platforms, not just solid, but technologies beyond that in single molecule sequencing.  And so that's basically headcount in terms of the key areas that we're accentuating.  ", "In terms of dollars, as we said in the past we're going to primarily focus on paying down our debt, but you'll start to see from us in the ensuing weeks and months announcements of more strategic technology acquisitions.", "Nothing large, nothing transformative, but more additive to the portfolio we have.  And I would say that many of these acquisitions will focus around really building out our applied business and continuing to build the platform of molecular diagnostics.", "Operator", "Your next questions comes from the line of Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "[Matt] \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Hi guys.  It's actually [Matt] in for Quintin.  Congratulations on the quarter.  So first, just with the NIH and kind of the NIH expectations for Q4 and as we move into 2010 I think we understand the big money related to sequencing and instruments but Greg, maybe could you talk a little bit about the NIH as \u2013 in general is going to impact the rest of your business like CE and cloning?", "Greg Lucier", "", "Well, beyond particular earmarked projects you're basically seeing a rising tide lift all boats.  There has been more money going through R1 grants which then, it's up to the PI to determine what they need to buy for their particular lab and their experimentation.  And so part of our thinking is, is that our general reagent business, our stronghold in PCR and core CE sequencing will benefit from just increased expenditures coming through the NIH.  ", "[Matt] \u2013 Robert W. Baird & Co.", "Thanks for that.  And then with respect to H1N1, you guys did such a great job really placing a lot of instruments for H1N1.  Now that these boxes are in the labs, how are you thinking about possibly broadening the test venue maybe to stay closer to the patient?", "Greg Lucier", "That's a great question.  As David mentioned, our instrument really has become the de facto standard for H1N1 surveillance here in this country and really around the world now.  But since staying focused on the United States the, really I think, interesting opportunity for us is that those instruments reside in government labs across the 50 states.  ", "It's those same labs that do a whole host of testing beyond flu.  And we are developing a whole set of assays whether it's around other areas of infectious disease or the like.  And maybe Mark, you can talk to some of the other areas that we're developing technology now for that installed base that's existing.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, one of the examples would of course be in the food testing area.  We see a lot of interest in pathogen testing such as E. coli 0157 outbreaks.  We've ranged \u2013 introduced a range of assays for E. coli and listeria, salmonella, expanding out that range.  And then there are other areas that we think in that install base as we get into more diagnostic-based testing we can apply onto that platform.  So it is a good platform to broaden out our assay consumables.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank.  ", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "You've obviously done a phenomenal job on the cost side of things.  The synergy capture number continues to come up.  Where are we in sort of the cost realization spectrum of both from an acquisition standpoint in terms of how much wood have you chopped on ABI in terms of getting that to be far more profitable?  ", "And then as we go forward, as we think about kind of the incremental margin contribution in both next year and the following, where is the next level of savings coming from?  Is it more stickiness on some of the pricing programs that you've done?  Is it the revenue capture that you talked about that you expect to build next year?  What's sort of the next big leg, because obviously you've done a great job on sort of the original plan?", "Greg Lucier", "You know Ross, 2009 was really about achieving the basic back office synergies.  And I think, as you say, the team has done a really terrific job in capturing them.  2010 will be about two other things.  One is about revenue capture, and I'll have Bernd talk to that.  But the other is about really supply chain efficiencies.  ", "Now we've made some really great progress in the last six months gearing up for what we think will be terrific procurement savings, really important facility consolidations, and then key expansions into low cost countries where we can get further efficiencies.  So 2010 will be about getting those supply chain efficiencies and increased revenue capture, and Bernd why don't you give Ross a few inputs on that.", "Bernd Brust", "On the revenue capture next year we're really just going to obviously continue the efforts we began this year.  Pricing initiatives will continue, throughout the world our focus has been very much in the U.S. and Europe in the beginning of the merger of the two companies.  ", "We started this year by bringing some of the AB products into the Invitrogen team's bags and that will continue where we make sure that that team takes on some of the heavy load related to run rate business for the AB portfolio.  ", "And more and more customer integration as far as there's quite a difference still in maybe core AB customers where Invitrogen wasn't strong and vice versa and picking up the balances of portfolios of those customers is really making traction.  So as we continue those initiatives, we think in 2010 we'll see further acceleration.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank Securities", "", "Great, and on the stimulus, David you sort of gave some guidance for Q4.  I know it's very hard to predict, but what are you using?  Are you looking at sort of the order rates on the instrument side and making some rough assumptions for consumables?  Are you \u2013 is there kind of a backlog of solid instruments that you're kind of sort of baking in there?  I'm just trying to get the sense for how you're kind of coming up with the early estimates.  ", "And then as we sort of turn the page to next year, are we still thinking across the portfolio that the genetics analysis piece is sort of where we're first going to see and then it sort of flows through the rest of the company as labor comes on and general utilization goes up across NIH campuses?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, Ross this is Greg.  In terms of being able to estimate the amount of impact from the stimulus obviously it is just that, an estimate.  But we're basing it in the fact that we can track what grants have been awarded to an institution.  ", "In our follow-up then we can usually assess fairly well if they've started to spend the money against the particular award and then we can obviously track to our order board what came in from the lab, whether it was instruments or reagents.  So that's how our estimates are really based.  It's both on fact and then follow-up with these clients.  ", "And then on the last point you say about do we see more business coming from instruments versus reagents initially, I think that's generally true and Bernd can give some more color on the fact that we saw some beginnings of that at the end of the third quarter, more now in the beginning of the fourth quarter that we're seeing an increased rate of some instrumentation orders.", "Bernd Brust  ", "", "I think that's right Greg.  If you look at the \u2013 all those small numbers that David mentioned, the few million dollars in Q3 and $5 million to $10 million in Q4, much of that really is coming from the instrument lines across the spectrum of the portfolio actually and obviously we believe the outcome of that will be increased reagent consumption as those instruments come on line and users are there to operate the instruments.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS. ", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "", "When you start \u2013 can you remind us what the FX impact was on the operating margin and EPS year to date?  I'm just trying to get a sense of how we, now that currencies have moved back, how we should start thinking about this for 2010, particularly net of your hedging programs?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, Derik we can provide that detail.  Why I think that's probably better provided as a follow-up call so we'll pull that together and we'll have it there.  Do you have another question?", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "", "Yes, absolutely.  I guess, once again, just type of, I know you're not going to give guidance for 2010 but I'm just curious in broad terms of you've got the \u2013 held mass spec business offset by some of the debt repayments.  You've got a lot of moving parts in terms of synergies and stuff.  ", "I guess certainly when you start looking at EPS growth for next year are there any general guidelines?  I mean are we looking at double digits, mid teens, I mean, can you just give us some feel back on how you see the business giving all the moving parts?", "David Hoffmeister", "", "You know Derik, we think we're going to have a good 2010.  That's about what I'll say at this point.", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, I mean Derik, we're just in the process now Derik, like most of the companies I'm sure you're following going through, are planning for 2010.  We don't see anything that would lead us to believe that we wouldn't continue on the trajectory that we're on, but I think it's premature at this point to comment on any specifics on 2010.", "Derik De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay and just one follow up question.  Can you comment on the cell culture business, a couple of your \u2013 one of your competitors was saying their business picked up in 3Q, admittedly off of easier comps but also from some flu vaccine sales.  Can you just talk what you see in terms of your pharmaceutical customers there and specifically why there were the \u2013 their orders were off.", "Greg Lucier", "You know Derik as we've said in the past; you really can't compare us to our colleagues in this industry.  We all have our own set of customers with their own set of dynamics and it's still a great business, it's a lumpy business and we had some lumpiness in Q3 so that's really all we can say.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Let me just start with a question on royalties.  Can you remind us what the negative impacts of royalty expirations were in each of the first and second quarters and clearly you did a good job managing against the royalty expiration from the third quarter.  How likely or unlikely is it that you can continue to do a better job than your guidance range in managing against the royalty expirations in the quarter?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, in terms of the actual numbers I think they can get that data for you in a follow-up call, Doug, but more broadly of our efforts to offset the natural year-over-year declines we see in that PCR patent family, let me just kind of go back to the beginning.  ", "First of all, that patent family, as you know, extends over a very long period of time, all the way out into 2017 as I recall.  So we're going to have these PCR royalties with us for a long time, albeit though they do go down between now and that time I just mentioned.  ", "Now having said that we assembled a team about six, seven months ago; we brought together the best licensing people out of AB and Invitrogen.  They've now been together for about six months and you're now just starting to see the product that they've produced, which is the ability to start offsetting these royalty declines.", "Now they have some really exciting ideas and I think that this is something that we'll probably share in more detail in a coming earnings call/slash investor day early next year, but suffice it to say when we did the merger with AB one of the comments I made was we understood the patent family around PCR and we felt confident that over time our work could not only retard the reduction of it but maybe even increase it.  And I would say we're on track on that goal here only 10 months, 11 months into the merger.", "David Hoffmeister", "Doug, the actual numbers are royalties declined $7 million to $8 million in the first half of the year and as you recall we said they would accelerate \u2013 the decline would accelerate in the second half.  Third quarter royalties were down $7 million?", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Right.", "David Hoffmeister", "", "And Q4 we're estimating that it will down another $5 million to $8 million.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "And then maybe if I could ask another pricing question, and I guess this would probably be for Bernd.  You talked about a slight degradation expected in pricing in the fourth quarter, which of course is the norm for Invitrogen historically.  ", "But isn't there a bit of a catch-up still going on in terms of applying the Invitrogen pricing strategy to AB products?  And then I guess longer term is there any reason to think that you cannot get the typical 2% pricing increase annually next year and beyond.", "Bernd Brust", "Hi Doug, As far as the question on continued pricing obviously we want to make sure we price our products competitively.  At the same time be as aggressive as we can in getting the right price for our products.  The numbers we've set out and we've seen traditionally we believe we continue to get on our products specifically to Q4.  ", "There's no doubt that this year some of the pricing on the AB portfolio, given the new initiatives that weren't in place before are a little bit healthier.  We've seen it obviously in the first three quarters of this year as well and so that same downturn that we may see in the traditional fourth quarter of Invitrogen we also believe will hit us on the AB side a little bit.", "Doug Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "And then last question and then I'll get back in the queue, it's a stimulus question.  You talked about maybe getting some orders it sounds like probably late in the third quarter run off from stimulus given the way you talked about stimulus during the quarter where do you expect much of an impact?  So I just wanted to make sure that was the case.", "And then again, another longer term question.  Do you expect that well, maybe you won't see the same degree of upfront instrument bolus that some others in the group might see, given that they have a higher instrument sales mix?  That over time Life is going to see a more consistent and prolonged benefit that'll last several years, just given the fact that there is probably the possibility or likelihood of continued consumables pull-through?", "Greg Lucier", "Yes, I think on this last point I would just echo what you say.  Every instrument we sell now with the divestiture of mass spec consumes a lot of consumables and so part of the strategy that Bernd is putting together is just how do we capture the lion's share of all those consumables that will be needed by not only our instruments but our competitor's instruments as they get installed?", "Bernd Brust", "And to that point, what we're doing to capture that revenue we are bringing in a significant number of additional sales resources in the U.S. next year that will primarily focus on the larger academic accounts are the recipients of these funds so that any reagent pull-through on those instruments, both ourselves and our competitors, are going to come our way.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "", "First thing, on just next gen sequencing, I was wondering if I heard you right when you mentioned that with headcount adds in that business area that you might be looking at sort of a parallel development path for single molecule technologies versus solid and I'm wondering if that's right?", "And secondly, just maybe if you could lay out what you think the key strategic considerations need to be in that business for you guys as it relates to sort of the competitive landscape today, both with the current generation and other single molecule platforms potentially around the corner?", "Bernd Brust", "So firstly on the program itself we do already have a parallel program.  So as well as investing in solid and the future generations of solid, we have a program ongoing in a single molecule effort that is progressing well and we believe we'll be introducing a competitive platform in the coming market here.", "As regard to what we think when we look at this market, we think there'll be continuing an opportunity for these short read systems such as our solid system where the through-put really allows you to do experiments in sequencing and comparative sequencing that'll continue to be the case for the next three to five years.  And so we'll invest in that through-put.  We'll invest in that accuracy.", "We think the single molecule programs will be particularly good and the advantage we see in that is what we get long run reads with high accuracy.  And so we're developing the chemistry and we think that'll be most important as we come into this marketplace to be able to show that to the community and we'll start demonstrating and showing some of that data during next year 2010.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "And then just a second question on H1N1 and the continued strength you saw there, I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on the type of incremental funding that you're seeing for that type of product?  Is it at the state level maybe for additional equipment or is it really more pull-through on the consumables for the installed equipment you already have at the various state labs?", "Bernd Brust", "At this point I think we have seen the bolus of new instruments that were placed \u2013 ordered for the H1N1 testing specifically.  At this point it's fairly, or mainly [Rage] and pull-through our SuperScript and AgPath, our reagent portfolio [DEB] are being purchased by those users now for testing.", "Isaac Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "And then just lastly, to clear up on the media business, could you maybe comment if there was any customer specificity regarding the weakness there this quarter?  And I'm wondering is there maybe a timing element there that snaps back in the fourth quarter?  And then just lastly, big picture on that business, how do you look at the opportunities to grow faster than the market?  Is there incremental opportunity with chemically-defined media type products?", "Greg Lucier", "", "Well on that last point clearly virtually all new biologics now are being done in chemically-defined media and our format there is AGT, that's advanced granular formulation, really has captured a big share of the market for new biologics.  So we're very pleased with that.", "Just in terms of quarter-to-quarter sales of this business, I would first just step back and say you have to remember this is probably less than 4% or 5% of the company.  It's a fairly small portion now of the new Life Technologies and because of just the way that our customers run their factories there is a fair amount of perturbation in ordering between quarters.  That's basically all we saw here in Q3.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley.", "Morgan Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "So a few things, the first thing I just wanted to make sure the royalty offsets that you guys talked about that you were able to put in place are continuing, right?  So that it's not like we'll see sort of it's not shifting sort of shifting royalties out into 2010 or beyond?", "Greg Lucier", "That's correct.", "Morgan Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then on the CE front it was another, obviously, good quarter.  You guys have been hesitant to talk about how sustainable this is going to be.  So where are you guys thinking we stand on that front right now and are you kind of getting more positive that that business is going to see sustainable growth?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, Marshall, we've certainly been surprised a little bit by how strong CE has remained in some of the research segments and we're seeing that with labs still use CE to do some of their finishing experiments.  And it kind of reaffirms our view that we see actually a continuum of these sequencing technologies across both CE both solid and now into the single molecule that we'll continue to offer.", "We also, of course, introduced in this market the new 3500 instrument which will go into some of these hospitals and diagnostic labs.  So that'll also begin to give us strength in the CE market.  It's a very easy to use system, very straightforward for the labs who just want to do some simple straightforward sequencing.", "Given that we've been more positive in these results, however, the more medium trend is over time still for next generation sequencing to replace this research segment and so we still expect declines over time offset by this large growth in diagnostics and forensic market that'll go on in the CE applied market segment.", "Morgan Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "And then on that, just getting maybe a little more granular there, can you give us a sense of how much on the \u2013 how much of the growth in CE is being driven by consumables versus instruments?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, the majority of the growth will still come in the future from continued use in consumables.  The instruments over time we would still expect to decline as there's not that many more placements going on outside these diagnostic labs and forensic labs.", "Morgan Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "But in the current \u2013 in the last few quarters has it been mostly instruments or are we seeing sort of equal contribution from consumables and instruments in CE?", "Mark Stevenson", "", "In CE it's a balance because you have some of the balance of the new forensic placements going in that are balancing some of the growth in consumables.", "Eileen Pattinson", "[Antoine], we have time for one more caller.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Capital.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "I think most have been asked.  Just one question, Greg, you mentioned and I think you kind of guided in fact after the second quarter that some of your \u2013 you thought some of the investments you'd made SG&A would be up sequentially and you said that given what you saw in July you kind of put some of those on pause.  Can you just talk about what kind of investments those were specifically and how we think about those coming back online?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, when we did the early in the quarter expense control part of it was non-project related and that was just tightening up on travel and the usual things companies do.  Then the other part was project-related which just allowed us to shift our focus of when we start these programs a month or so out into the fourth quarter.", "And that's why I guided to say that some of these expenses will return in the coming quarters.  Part of it here for us was we have a number of different R&D projects that we want to get launched and so we just shifted the launching of those R&D projects out, like I said, about a month or so.", "David Hoffmeister", "Then there were some marketing programs we said last quarter.  It was basically R&D and marketing.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "So is there any reason to think that on the travel side are there stuff, or do you find that \u2013 some companies I'm talking to are saying we're finding we can actually do a lot more with less so some of these costs just probably won't come back?  Or do you think some of these more discretionary items that you talked about will come back as well?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, I think we showed that we can have great results by saving and tightening the belt a bit more, so like really every company out there we're doing more with less and I anticipate that will continue.", "David Hoffmeister", "You're absolutely right, Jon, we're driving efficiencies, but as I said in my prepared remarks that we do expect that expenses, operating expenses in the fourth quarter will increase.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "And then last question here, you made some comments around \u2013 there's been a few discussions around kind of the next generation of sequencing.  You mentioned things you might be doing internally on single molecule.  ", "As we move to this next iteration of kind of cheaper, easier-to-use, how complete is that technology portfolio, Greg?  Or you mentioned acquisitions on maybe moving into more of some of the applied diagnostic markets, but what about just on the technology front associated with what you perceive to be kind of the future of sequencing?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, your question is how complete.  Clearly we have a very exciting clear roadmap for solid over the next couple of years, and as Mark mentioned that will be higher throughput, more accuracy, more usability with automation.  We also have had the ongoing program around single molecule which will get launched and we think will be a game-changer in the field of single molecule sequencing.", "And then I would say we have a fairly large team, obviously, probably the biggest in the world out scouring the generation technology even beyond that.  And we're working on intellectual property.  We're working on licensing.  We're working on collaborations with a generation technology that even exceeds single molecule.", "And when Mark talks about the continuum I would only back that up to say look, we are going to be over the course of time the sequencing company and we'll have a range of technologies to offer to customers and we're very serious about that commitment.", "Jon Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research Equities", "Could I just ask a theoretical question there, Greg, to follow up?  If you saw some technology that would rapidly cannibalize your CE business, would you be willing to \u2013 would you be \u2013 some people, it's hard as a public company in terms of what to do sometimes, but would you be willing to cannibalize your existing cells to make sure that you had that business?", "Greg Lucier", "That's an easy question, of course.  I mean look, if you're going to \u2013 if substitution's going to happen you want to be the company that substitutes yourself and that's really not a conflict inside this company because it happens all the time.", "It's just the case of in your example CE would be a little bit bigger than other examples we've certainly done to ourselves over the past five to six years.  But the answer is absolutely yes.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you.  We are out of time.  Thank you for joining us.  This concludes our third quarter earnings conference call.  This webcast will be available via a replay on the website for three weeks.  Thank you again for joining the call.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference call.

(Operator Instructions).", "I will now turn the conference over to your host for today, Eileen Pattinson, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, operator and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call.", "Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; Mark Stevenson, President and Chief Operating Officer; and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Bernd Brust, our Chief Commercial Officer is available during the Q&A portion of the call.", "If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen and thank you all for joining us. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we put out this morning.", "During today's call, I will cover our achievements for the year and our recent product announcements and our outlook for 2010. Mark Stevenson will talk about our integration progress over the past year and also provide some color on divisional performance. Finally, David will then cover more specifics on our financials for the quarter and the year as well as provide additional details on our view for 2010.", "We had a terrific fourth quarter with 11% organic growth, which rounded out a strong year for Life Technologies. 2009 was our first full year after the Applied Biosystems and Invitrogen merger, and our teams around the world performed in an exceptional manner.", "We ended the year with 7% organic growth, 300 basis points of operating margin expansion and $534 million in free cash flow. This performance was the result of a lot of hard work and executing on our three strategic imperatives; delivering on the integration, realizing the potential of the new company and investing for future growth.", "Our first strategic imperative, delivering on the integration, is critical to our success. We methodically executed upon our integration plans, which enabled us to deliver over 100 million in synergies, considerably higher than our original expectations. In addition to the sizable synergies realized, we were able to merge the two companies into truly one company with a solid foundation of processes and systems.", "We still have integrations in place to realize more synergies, but in 2009 we were able to complete all the basic actions necessary to operate as one company. In terms of synergy capture in 2010, by the end of this year we'll have taken actions for both revenue acceleration and cost reductions that will generate 175 million in synergies on an annual basis in 2011, one full year ahead of the original three-year integration schedule.", "Beyond the accelerated integration efforts, 2009 was a strong year on a number of measures including organic growth, new product launches and productivity gains. As we announced yesterday, our development efforts last year set us up for an impressive line of new sequencing products to be launched in the next several months, which I'll speak about in a moment.", "As you know, next-generation sequencing represents less than 5% of our revenues, and as such we also had numerous new products launched in other areas of our business, the most notable of which is our new flow cytometer, Attune. This product launched in December at the American Society of Cell Biology Conference to outstanding reviews from customers and industry experts alike.", "Attune will begin shipping at the beginning of the second quarter and we already have customers lined up. The launch of this product represents our entry into the $1.4 billion flow cytometry market. In the next five years, we anticipate sales will exceed $100 million from our flow cytometry products.", "In addition to the new instruments introduced this year, 2009 was another year of rapid releases for new reagent products and benchtop devices, and 2010 is shaping up to be even better.", "I want to now take a moment to talk about our sequencing business and a number of new and very exciting products we'll be launching this year. You'll hear more about some of these products in February at the annual AGBT meeting, but today let me focus on the press release we issued yesterday.", "As we announced, we are launching our new SOLiD 4 next-generation sequencing system this quarter, a system that we believe will deliver the highest quality genome on the market. It's important to understand that as sequencing becomes more of a clinical tool, meaning that as doctors begin to look at a person's genomic data as a basis for diagnosing and treating disease, it's critical that this data be as accurate as possible.", "When you're talking about three billion base pairs, an error rate of even 1% will add up to 30 million mistakes. That's just not good enough when it comes to making decisions that affect peoples' health. That's why we're so excited about SOLiD 4. It will generate up to 100 gigabases of mappable sequence data per run, but more importantly it will deliver unparalleled accuracy.", "In fact, by the second half of this year when the SOLiD 4hq package, an upgrade to SOLiD 4, will be available, researchers will be able to generate 300 gigabases of mappable data at 99.99% accuracy. Four nines. This is a remarkable achievement, and given that the system will lower the cost of sequencing a genome to about $3,000 later this year, we now have an instrument that delivers such accuracy and cost as to truly replace array-based technology.", "We have already gotten tremendously positive feedback from our customers about what SOLiD 4 will help them achieve. Of course, one collaboration involving the SOLiD 4 System that we're particularly excited about is the one we announced this morning with the Ignite Institute for Individualized Health. As we announced in our release this morning, Ignite will acquire 100 SOLiD 4 Systems, creating the largest next-generation genome sequencing facility in North America.", "Ignite is a unique organization, one that is focused on integrating R&D, commercialization and clinical care to create medical solutions fit for the 21st century, solutions based on personalized medicine. We're proud that Life Technologies will partner with such an innovative organization that is truly focused on translational research. As I said earlier, we're now at a stage where we need to look beyond the technological innovations to how the application of these technologies can be used to improve human health.", "As sequencing becomes more rapid, accurate and cost effective, we also need to devote attention and resources to other factors. That's why we also announced yesterday that we will dedicate approximately $100 million over the next few years to solve the major challenges related to interpreting and understanding the data generated by sequencing. Our foundation will dedicate $5 million over the next two years to educating physicians on how to use this data to truly help their patients. I'm proud that Life Technologies has the drive and the capability to not just create the best sequencing technologies, but help the community use those technologies to make a difference in ways that really affect peoples' lives.", "The use of life science tools and technologies in medical applications is already happening today, of course, specifically in molecular diagnostics, which is a $3 billion market growing at 15% annually. In 2009, we had over 300 million of sales related to molecular diagnostics, so we're already having a strong presence in this high growth market.", "Our product offerings in this fast growing business range from reagents and OEM components to products that are cleared for diagnostic use in the U.S. and Europe. To further our participation in the molecular diagnostics arena, we will make investments in developing diagnostic content for our 7500 Fast Dx RT PCR instrument and our 3500 Dx capillary electrophoresis systems, as well as create new tools and components for research in this field.", "In addition, we recently announced the acquisition of AcroMetrix, a provider of diagnostic quality control products. This acquisition allows us to further expand our diagnostic capabilities and also expand our direct channel to molecular diagnostics clients. The focus and investment we're putting on moving sequencing technologies into the clinic and making ever more molecular diagnostic tools that will fuel our revenue growth in the long term.", "Now for our 2010 expectations. We expect that organic revenue growth will grow in the mid to high single digits. Including the impact of the previously announced mass spectrometry divestiture, earnings per share will grow 10 to 15%. I'll let David get more into the specifics about our expectations, but clearly we are anticipating another solid year of financial performance and value creation for our shareholders.", "Beyond 2010, our outlook is equally compelling, with even more new products on the horizon and investments in markets such as food testing, molecular diagnostics and biofuels research adding to our growth rates. In the meanwhile, each and every day we remain focused on execution.", "Since 2006, after we transformed the operating rhythm of the organization, we set out to be a company that could prioritize better than any and reliably complete those basic but essential tasks that make up great performance. Our results speak for themselves. Since that time, our earnings per share have grown from $1.46 per share to $3.04 per share 2009, in spite of the worst economic downturn in 60 years and a very large transformative acquisition. In 2010, we will continue to deliver this reliable performance.", "I'll now hand it over to Mark Stevenson, who will provide some color on the integration and each of the divisions.", "Mark Stevenson", "Thank you, Greg. As Greg mentioned, one of our strategic imperatives is delivering on the integration. Now that Life Technologies has been operating for one full year as a combined company, I thought it fitting to make a few comments on the integration and the incredible company that is being created in the process.", "Over the last year, we have worked diligently to extract the best attributes from both companies and create really a unique business with substantial scale and scope. The integration team made significant progress in 2009. However, there is still a lot of hard work to be done, and we remain focused on executing our integration plans.", "With that said, I'll tell you a little bit about the progress we have made so far. Life Technologies has retained an incredibly talented workforce. Our sales teams were recently ranked number one by our customers in both instruments and reagents. Our extensive service and support teams are focused on providing the highest service level to our customers.", "Our R&D teams manage the most comprehensive offering of technologies available, and in 2009 Life Technologies launched over 1,000 new product SKUs, and we will accelerate that pace in 2010 and beyond. We are making significant investments in research and development, so that we will remain on the cutting edge of science and technology. By doing this, we can not only meet the evolving needs of our customers, but actually accelerate scientific advancement by bringing relevant and innovative technologies to market.", "The scope of Life Technologies is broader than either company could have achieved on a stand-alone basis. As a combined company, we serve over 160 countries around the world, we process 11,000 orders a day and distribute more than 8,000 shipments every single day. Our geographic presence and large volume of orders allows us to drive down the costs and become ever more efficient in our operations. The combination of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems' strengths is really proving out to be a true competitive advantage that will sustain us into the future.", "With that said, I'll move on to provide some specifics on the divisional performance. In the fourth quarter, Molecular Biology Systems grew approximately 15% organically to 422 million in revenue. The majority of H1N1-related products reside within this group and accounted for approximately four points of growth for the division. While we continue to partner with the CDC and other global health organizations to ensure H1N1 public health monitoring, we expect minimal revenue from H1N1-related products in 2010.", "Organic growth was also positively impacted by the continued strength in the TaqMan arrays business, in addition to strong demand for qPCR instrumentation and reagents. Additionally, we saw an uptake in the sale of PCR instruments and consumables, a direct result of stimulus funding. For the year, Molecular Biology Systems grew 9% organically to 1.58 billion. Double-digit growth in the genomic assays and high single digit growth in PCR systems was offset by the expected decline in PCR royalties.", "Cell Systems had revenues of 211 million in the quarter or 4% organic growth. Strong growth in many of the business areas, such as our magnetic beads and stem cell technologies, was slightly offset by a year-over-year decline in our Bioproduction business. The decline in Bioproduction this year can be mostly attributed to customer-specific issues. We expect that this business will return to a more robust growth in 2010. Total year revenue for Cell Systems was 789 million or 4% organic growth.", "Genetic Systems had revenue of 234 million in the quarter, representing 13% organic growth. For the full year, Genetic Systems had revenue of 907 million or 9% organic growth, after accounting for the LIMS divestiture. Revenue for CE systems and consumables sold into the research market was flat in the fourth quarter and for the full year.", "This result performance is of particular note since we expected the market would decline in the high single to low double digits as genome centers decommission CE systems in favor of next-generation sequencing systems. We now believe that the decommissioning process is largely complete, and going forward we expect this business to be relatively stable. CE systems and kits sold into applied markets, such as forensics and environmental testing, grew double digits in the quarter, and we expect that this business will continue to grow at a similar rate in the coming year.", "Finally, next-generation sequencing continues to gain traction in the market with strong double digit growth in the quarter. We expect that the full suite of next-generation sequencing platforms that Greg spoke about earlier will continue to drive strong growth in the years to come.", "Finally, in our Mass Spectrometry division, our joint venture with MDS, revenue growth 7% organically to 130 million. All geographies contributed to growth year-over-year, with Japan growing in the double digits. On a full year basis, this division declined 1%, in line with our expectation of flat to down 10% for the year.", "As you are aware, we are in the process of selling our stake in this business to Danaher Corporation. We are in the final stages of this process and now expect the transaction to close shortly.", "Now I will turn it over to David Hoffmeister for a full description of the 2009 results and our outlook for 2010.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thank you, Mark and good morning, everyone. I'll now take you through the financial details of the fourth quarter and the full year 2009 results.", "This quarter, revenue grew 14% to $874 million. Excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, revenue grew 11% organically. This was a strong quarter for organic growth with good performance across all our businesses and geographies.", "For the full year, revenue grew 5% to 3.3 billion. Excluding the impact from currency and divestitures, revenue grew 7% organically. We're very pleased with these results, especially in the face of a large integration and a tough economic environment.", "Let me briefly highlight a couple of items that we have mentioned in the past that contributed to growth again this quarter. Demand for our H1N1-related products was approximately 15 million for the quarter, resulting in full year revenues of about 45 million. Also, an order in the Japanese police force outfitting them with our 3130xl CE sequencer and sample preparation kits, totaling 20 million for the year, contributed nine million in the quarter. These are two good examples of how the broader capabilities of Life Technologies better position us to capitalize on these types of opportunities as they arise.", "In terms of organic growth by region, excluding the mass spec division the Americas grew 9% in the fourth quarter, Europe grew 11%, Asia Pacific 23% and Japan 9%. Currency this quarter contributed approximately 4% to revenue growth, net of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.06 of earnings per share, including foreign currency impacts accounted for in revenue, other income and the mass spec joint venture.", "On a full year basis, currency decreased revenue growth by approximately 2%, net of our hedging program. This impacted EPS negatively by approximately $0.19. The divestiture of the LIMS business had a negative one point effect on reported revenue growth in the fourth quarter and half a point impact on the full year.", "Moving on to other items, fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 65%, an increase of approximately 130 basis points over prior year. Positive price realization across the portfolio, positive currency impact, synergies and lower royalty expense all contributed to the gross margin improvements, offset slightly by the negative impact of lower royalty revenue.", "On a sequential basis, gross margins declined as expected by 200 basis points as a result of lower price, a higher mix of instruments and OEM orders and the recognition of higher manufacturing expenses as we drew down inventory at year-end. As a reminder, gross margins in the fourth quarter are typically lower for these reasons.", "For the full year, gross margins equaled 66.3%, an improvement of 70 basis points over prior year. Positive price, lower royalty expense and synergies from the merger drove the increase, which was partially offset by the negative impact of lower royalty revenue and currencies.", "As expected, fourth quarter operating expenses of 342 million were higher than the previous quarter and the prior year. The increase resulted from investments in the commercial organization, in marketing programs aimed at capturing the stimulus and other opportunities, R&D programs for benchtop instrumentation and sequencing and depreciation as investments ramped up over the year. In addition, we entered into several collaborative R&D partnerships in the quarter.", "Total operating expenses for 2009 equaled 1.3 billion, a $7 million decline year-over-year. Fourth quarter operating income was 226 million, an increase of 30% over prior year, including the impact of currency and 19% excluding currency. Our operating margin was 25.8%, representing the 300 basis points of improvement year-over-year including the impact from currency. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from higher gross margin and decreases in head count-related expenses as a result of the merger. As expected, operating margins declined on a sequential basis due to lower gross margins.", "For the full year, operating income equaled 879 million, an increase of 18% over the prior year including the impact of currency and 22% excluding currency. Operating margin expanded 300 basis points for the full year to 26.6% including the impact of currency, and 27% excluding currency. Full year operating margin expansion was a result of improved gross margins and decreased head count expenses due to synergies, partially offset by increases in depreciation and purchased services.", "In terms of other income line items in the quarter, we had two million of interest income and approximately 16 million of income from our mass spec joint venture. Other income for the full year consisted of five million of interest income and 46 million of income from mass spec. Interest expense for the quarter was 36 million and 150 million for the full year.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate for the fourth quarter was 26.2%, resulting in a full year tax rate of 28.5%. The tax rate in the fourth quarter was lower than in previous quarters due to higher income in lower tax rate jurisdictions. Specifically, we had increased sales of instruments manufactured in Singapore where we have a significantly lower tax rate.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 187.3 million shares and 181.4 million for the full year. As you'll recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.26, which includes $0.29 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.04 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.19 per share of business integration costs and other items, and $0.02 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs resulting from the early repayment of term loans. On a non-GAAP basis which excludes these items, diluted earnings per were $0.80 for the quarter.", "For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.80, which includes $1.43 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.17 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with APB14-1, $0.59 per share of business integration costs and other items; and $0.05 per share of accelerated amortization of debt issuance cost. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share for the year were $3.04.", "As a reminder, there is a full reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures in today's press release and on our website.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were 648 million, including approximately 41 million held as restricted cash. For the quarter, cash from operating activities was 264 million, capital expenditures were 77 million and free cash flow was $187 million, resulting in full year free cash flow of $534 million.", "We repaid 150 million of term loan B during the fourth quarter and 425 million of term loans A and B for the full year. We ended the year with approximately 3.1 million of debt. The balance is made up of our convertible debt of 1.1 billion, in addition to term loans of two billion. As a reminder, 350 million of convertible debt is classified as short term with a put call date of August 1 of this year.", "I'll now move on to our outlook for 2010. Before I get started, you should note that all guidance I'm providing today assumes we close the mass spec divestiture in the next few days.", "As Greg mentioned earlier, we expect to grow revenue organically in the mid to high single digits. Due to the high volatility of currency rates in 2009, we are providing a range for the possible impact on revenue from currency in 2010. The effect on revenue is expected to be in the range of one to two points of additional growth, including the impact of our hedging program. The low end of the range is calculated using the 2009 average rates and the high end is calculated using year-end rates. For modeling purposes, you can choose the rates that you feel are most appropriate.", "Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $3.30 to $3.50. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of 575 to 600 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be 150 to 175 million, including approximately 30 million of integration-related capital.", "Our free cash flow forecast also includes approximately 100 million of one-time expenses related to the integration. These costs will be excluded from pro forma earnings, but they're nonetheless cash, so they will lower free cash flow in 2010.", "Additional items impacting free cash flow during 2010 include the full-year impact of cash bonuses paid to Applied Biosystems employees versus 2009 when bonuses covered only half the year, and cash impact from the divestiture of the mass spec business. It's important to note that as in the past our free cash flow will be back end loaded in the year due to normal working capital fluctuations throughout the year and the payout of annual bonuses in the first quarter.", "A few other items related to our expectations in the coming year include the following. We've included the impact from the stimulus in our forecast. As we've stated in the past, we expect to receive in excess of $100 million in revenue over the life of the program. The exact size and timing of this is difficult to predict since the funds are just beginning to flow.", "In the last half of 2009, we had approximately 50 million of revenue as a result of stimulus funding and we expect stimulus-related revenues to slowly ramp up in the first half of the year with the majority of the benefit realized in the latter half of 2010 and into 2011.", "As these benefits materialize in 2010, we plan to take the opportunity to reinvest approximately half of the operating profit impact back into the core business to drive future organic growth. We will focus the investment in several areas, including sequencing technologies, which Greg mentioned earlier and accelerating the expansion of our commercial organization in some of our faster growing markets such as China.", "Synergy savings for 2009 were 95 million, and we exited the year at a run rate of over 100 million on an annual basis. In 2010, we will put actions in place to achieve additional 70 million in synergy savings on an annual basis. You can expect that the annualized run rate exiting 2010 will be $175 million.", "Royalty revenue is no longer expected to decline in 2010. Due to the efforts of our licensing team, the previously announced decline of 10 to 15 million has been offset with revenue from new license agreements. At this point, we still expect royalties to decline by 20 million in 2011.", "We expect operating margins to expand between 100 and 125 basis points. This improvement will largely result from capturing additional synergies.", "The pro forma tax rate will be approximately 29.0 to 29.5% depending on the geographical mix of income throughout the year. Interest income will fluctuate depending on our cash balance. Our average interest rate on investments is approximately 50 to 60 basis points.", "Interest expense is expected to be in the range of 120 to $130 million, depending on the timing of debt repayment and interest rate fluctuations. Inclusive in this number are any changes in capital structure which may come as a result of the waiver we filed yesterday. The waiver seeks agreement from our current lenders to permit the issuance of debt securities, the proceeds of which would be used to repay the term loans. The waiver is effective for up to six months.", "Also included in interest expense guidance is the expectation that we would make the following debt repayments during 2010 to reach our target leverage ratio of 2.0 to 2.5 times EBITDA. We anticipate making 140 million of mandatory debt repayments on the term loans and approximately 290 million utilizing the proceeds from the mass spec divestiture.", "Our diluted share count is approximately 190 million at today's stock price, but it will increase if our stock price increases due to dilution from our convertible debt, as well as stock options. Assuming an average share price between 52 and $55, the share count would range between 192 and 194 million shares.", "Finally, here are a couple of other variables that may further help in modeling the business. First, you can assume that every point of organic growth contributes about $0.07 of earnings per share and every 10 million in operating expenses equals $0.03 per share. Second, in order to help estimate the effect of currency, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved against the dollar by 5% and our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this scenario, the impact on earnings per share would be $0.10.", "With that, I'll hand the call back over to Eileen so we can answer any questions that you may have. Eileen?", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, David. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-And-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi, good morning and congratulations on a nice year-end.", "Greg Lucier", "Thank you, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "On the third quarter call, you kind of gave out a 2010 outlook of mid-single digit organic. Now here we go into 2010 now and you're looking at mid to high single digits and minimal expectations for H1N1. So could you tell me a little bit about what do you see incrementally better since then? Then as a follow-up, any outlook on the potential for NIH funding 2011 and onward based on what President Obama's been talking?", "Greg Lucier", "Sure. Thanks. I think one of the primary drivers for the higher organic growth in 2010 would be the timing of the stimulus. It's clear now most of it will fall into 2010 versus our earlier thinking that some more of it would have fallen into 2009 per the proclamations from the politicians. So again, I think that's the primary driver for higher organic growth in 2010.", "The second part of your question was relating to the NIH. As you know, the NIH ex-stimulus got approximately 2% increase in the current fiscal budget 2010. In our current discussions, at least we have heard, is that the NIH will probably get another increase in fiscal year 2011. We don't think it will be held flat, but obviously it's subject to a lot of negotiation yet to be had. We're actually encouraged that the NIH in this current environment of potentially flat discretionary spending will actually be one of the budgets that does get an increase.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "All right. Thanks. I know you've got a lot of questions, so I'll jump back into the queue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Hey, good morning and congrats on the nice quarter.", "Greg Lucier", "Thank you.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Maybe just start off on the new product introduction. Can you talk a little bit about the go-to-market strategy for SOLiD 4, how you approach your current installed base and maybe just any color on pricing, consumables? Then also with Ignite, it looks like you're getting payments over three years. So if you could talk a little bit about whether there's a change in the payment terms for your customers going forward that would be helpful.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yeah, Tycho. This is Mark. So we started discussing with our customers SOLiD 4 over the last couple of weeks. We're excited to accelerate that. I mean, some of the investments you saw us make during Q4 was really accelerating the R&D. The customers have been very positive in the response we've got. Really going to our installed base, new customers; we've always said we felt this had the highest potential to upgrade our existing customer base. So we've really been going to them, explaining the roadmap and how we've accelerated that. So they're very excited about that and particularly on the accuracy. They're beginning to see the difference it makes in the results to really ensure that they're not getting any false positives in that. So very positive response as we've gone to those customers and we upgrade and outlaid the path for the year.", "We expect payment terms will be as normal for customers that we deal with, no change in that policy. We were very excited to the partnership we announced this morning with Ignite, really in line with our strategic priorities about how do we translate this closer to the clinic. Ignite, with its capabilities and its vision is really all about taking that much closer and translating these discoveries we're making really into a clinical practice.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Then can you comment on your assumptions for consumables on the new instrument?", "Mark Stevenson", "So we would expect the consumables to ramp up in a normal way. With the capacity now to go to the $6,000 genome and then 3,000 at the end of the year, we'll expect the pull-through to be very high during the usage of that as people replace other technologies now to ramp up on that.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Then Greg, in your comments you talked about trying to kind of accelerate I think the pace of product introductions. Are we going to see kind of a big bolus in the next couple years from some of these R&D efforts, and can you talk a little bit about how we should be thinking about R&D spend? Then if you can also include any comments on M&A and your appetite for smaller tuck-in deals right now that'd be helpful.", "Greg Lucier", "Sure. Well, I think you've started to see early signs of what has been a very aggressive innovation agenda by the company. So, the development and now launch of the flow cytometer product, which is very disruptive, very proprietary technology, now with SOLiD 4 continuing to show and demonstrate that it is in our belief the most accurate chemistry to read the genome, and you'll hear more in the coming month at AGBT of some other major breakthroughs. You can expect that pace of innovation to continue coming out of the company. As Mark was mentioning, one of the primary motives for bringing these two companies together was to drive the scale around R&D, to really create ever more innovation in life sciences. You're seeing the very early stages of that.", "In terms of the overall spend on R&D, we hover around 10, 10.5%. As we accelerate our organic growth, we think the R&D spend will stay in and around that percentage. Now we're dealing with some very large numbers, and numbers that are far larger than our competitors that allow us to have this scale of innovation that we hope will be unmatched.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Then...", "Greg Lucier", "Acquisitions, sorry.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Your appetite for tuck-in M&A and...", "Greg Lucier", "Yes. We're very, very comfortable with the current portfolio inside the company. Invitrogen did a lot of acquisitions to build up a platform, AB did a few. The combination of the two, we believe has a very strong portfolio as it is. Therefore, we don't have to do any large acquisitions to add to this. However, we do have a good sense of paranoia that sometimes the best ideas are outside our company, and so we will continue to do smaller tuck-in, primarily oriented around technology acquisitions to bring it into the family.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Then just a last one, a clarification on the royalties. Can you give us a sense as to whether your ability to kind of offset there was a function of going back to customers and getting paid what you were owed? Or was it adding the digital PCR patents to the estate and being able to leverage that a little bit more?", "Greg Lucier", "Really all of the above. As I mentioned to some folks at your conference, we have reformulated the licensing team. It's a very capable group of people. They've gone back to existing licensees. They've looked back into our portfolio and gone out to license other technologies. This year they achieved, I think, nice progress to mitigate the decline we were expecting. They've got their work cut out to start for 2011.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Lucier", "You bet.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "It sounds like you guys had a pretty good solid quarter, maybe even picking up some momentum. Could you talk about whether or not there was any notable change in competitive win rates, maybe talk a little bit about stimulus impact to that business and how things are differing across different geographies?", "Greg Lucier", "Let me take the first part of the question. So what we said was we saw some impact of the stimulus in the quarter, about eight to 10 million in the quarter. We think it's now starting to come through the pipeline. In terms of win rates, we believe that the creation of the organization is allowing us to pick up increased market share at key accounts around the world on key areas of technology, whether it's customers wanting to consolidate their purchases into one vendor and save a lot of processing costs or in other areas like qPCR instrumentation where we had a very robust fourth quarter. So we feel good about our win rates and we think in the coming years that we'll be able to actually increase the market share in this industry.", "Bernd, do you want to add any color commentary to maybe some of the emerging markets?", "Bernd Brust", "Sure. I mean, first I think in general on the selling organizations around the world, the combined organization, you really now have the reagent or consumables sales force have now focused on both the AB and Invitrogen portfolios, which gives you a tremendous pull-through and allows the traditional legacy AB team to focus more on instrumentation and get a bigger footprint on that side. We're seeing some tremendous payoffs happening on that end.", "Emerging markets around the world, we continue to see tremendous growth in Latin America, China, Middle East and other countries. Along those lines, we continue to invest in those areas to capture share and be as close to those customers as we can, and those investments will continue to happen.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "That's helpful. Then David, you were really clear in providing background on why gross margin pulls back sequentially as it always does in the fourth quarter. Despite that, the Street was actually a little bit higher with our forecast. So that's probably just a function of poor modeling, but I just want to be clear. Was gross margin about where you expected it to be, and what was the FX impact in the quarter?", "David Hoffmeister", "Gross margin was where we expected it to be. If you look back on last year, the pattern is almost identical on a relative basis. In total on an EPS level, gross margin was or I mean currency had a $0.06 impact.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. One last question, it's probably best for Greg. Your stock performance has lagged the group a little bit in the early part of 2010, recognizing that you guys just outgrew the group in the year by about 700 basis points and generated 300 basis points of operating leverage. Some of the reasons I've heard from some of the bears thrown around have been concerns about your long-term growth outlook and how much leverage there's going to be in the model, not just this year but beyond. So I want to give you an opportunity to address these concerns. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what you think the long-term targeted rate of organic growth is beyond 2010? Could you talk a little bit about whether or not it's right to think that operating margin could exceed maybe the historical peak for Invitrogen, which I believe was about 30%?", "Greg Lucier", "Thanks for the question. I think there seems to be a disconnect between the enthusiasm and confidence inside the company and some voices that you describe outside the company. We actually have never been more bullish on the future of the business. I don't know why there would be any even justification for why our growth rates would somehow go down after 2010. Whether it's just the increased pace of innovation, the innovation that can allow us to enter very big markets like flow cytometry and molecular diagnostics that we're now talking about, or our enhanced global footprint where we can be closer to customers than any other company in life sciences and grow our share, to just new emerging opportunities even beyond the current consideration of what we were even doing as independent companies two years ago, such as biofuels research. There is just a enormous amount of opportunities for this new platform company to grow. So I would just say that there's a big disconnect between how we feel and the confidence we see in the future to the voices you describe.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "I'll just, I guess get to the second part of that and then I'll get back into the queue. From a margin standpoint, are we anywhere close to where you guys think you can be over the next few years?", "Greg Lucier", "What we've said is that we can grow operating margins 50 basis points per year. In the past, we sometimes were asked the question, is there a limit at, let's say, 30% operating margin? We said we don't know. I guess my answer today would be, I don't see any reason why that represents a ceiling on the growth of the profitability of the company. As we increase our investment in proprietary technologies, we should be able to extract higher margins in the company. So I don't see any reason why we can't continue to drive 50 basis points improvement each and every year for several years to come. So I don't see a ceiling on that profitability of the company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company", "Okay. Thanks a lot. I appreciate you taking the questions.", "Greg Lucier", "You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with UBS. You may proceed", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Hey, good morning.", "Greg Lucier", "Good morning.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Just a couple of questions then I'll jump back in the queue on this. So on looking at the Cell Systems business, it was about 4% organic growth in 2009. I guess, how much of this do you attribute to changes in the cell culture process in the sense that customers are starting to get higher yields from some of their cell culture stuff and this is a volume decrease? Just talk about where you see trends in the Cell Systems business going.", "Greg Lucier", "As Mark mentioned, we think that this is an area that was impacted by some economic factors in 2009. We see it returning to historical growth rates of high single digits, low double digits here in 2010 for Bioproduction. There is no question that there is increased efficiencies taking place. At the same time, we believe our share of the molecules on the market is increasing as well. Now the other point I would say is that our guidance for Cell Systems in 2010 is mid to high single digits. So we see it returning to its historical growth patterns this year.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "That's helpful. Thanks. Going to the SOLiD 4, can you tell us what the cost of the upgrade is and how much of your installed SOLiD base would you expect to upgrade? I guess also the question, is what is the installed base of SOLiD?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, with regard to the upgrade, we're making it very affordable for our customers to upgrade to the system. So it'll be $10,000 to upgrade from the customers that are 3 Plus now to upgrade to 4. We expect that the majority of customers will upgrade that installed base and will continue to expand out on that. Then they'll also want to add in the EZ Bead System, which is $50,000 into that, which as we explained in the press release will cut their hands-on time by about 90%. Also improve the efficiency of that upfront ePCR process.", "So the installed base is growing bigger and bigger. We're not giving specific numbers, but we've made a lot of traction in the progress in the market and we think this will continue to reinforce the great roadmap we have by laying out what we're going to do to the end of the year. We've consistently beat and accelerated where we said we'll be on our platform, and now delivering on the platform.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Great. Just one final question. You alluded to investing in your own molecular diagnostic content. Would you care to elaborate?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, we're doing that in several ways. So one, we're doing it in partners. So we announced, for example, the partner earlier in the year with Asuragen, and we're developing that out, now going into clinical trials with BCR/ABL test. There are other partners that we're discussing with to bring proprietary content onto our platforms. We also see through these translational medicine collaborations that you see us setting up there'll be new and novel content discovered there that will come out again onto our platforms. So there are two ways that we see that coming through, both through partnerships and through the partnerships of taking this novel content onto our existing platforms.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley. You may proceed.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah, hey guys. Good morning. So first question just on the synergy opportunity in 2010. The incremental $75 million you guys talked about, can you give us just an idea of where that's coming from, price, cost realization, kind of what are the major drivers in 2010?", "Greg Lucier", "It's 70 million. As you mentioned, it's a combination of revenue and costs. As we said when we kicked off the synergy discussion at the beginning of this year, that initially it was going to be predominantly cost. As time went on we would get more revenue synergies and that's what we expect to happen. So there's going to be a greater mix of revenues.", "As far as costs go, we're going to continue to get synergies from purchasing. We identified earlier plant consolidations, other manufacturing opportunities. We expect to get those, as well as some consolidations and efficiencies in distribution.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. So sort of following on that, how should we be thinking about gross margin in 2010?", "David Hoffmeister", "What we've commented on is at the operating margin level, you can expect operating margins to expand by 100 to 125 basis points.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Given some of the investments you guys have talked about in R&D and SG&A, should we assume that the leverage there is coming on the gross margin front given you've talked about some of these manufacturing synergies?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, you can assume that we will get significant expansion or leverage in our margins, gross margins.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks. Just one other follow-up question on SOLiD, just to follow-up on a previous question. When you guys talked about the price of the genome coming down, is there any change in how you're pricing consumables? Or is this an accuracy, decreasing the coverage that you need sort of per genome to get to the same level of data?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yeah, it's really technological advances that we're making in this. The first advance that we're making in SOLiD 4 is a combination of new reagents, these total precision reagents that we've increased, and also the EZ Bead. That allows us to reduce the cost down for our customers down to $6,000. Then as we go to SOLiD hq, that upgrade will come from greater density from smaller beads. So it's a very straightforward upgrade for our customers also later in the year, and that'll get us up to the 300 gigabases and allow our customers to do runs of $3,000 to get a genome done.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Just to be clear, there's no change in the pricing policy on consumables?", "Mark Stevenson", "There's no change in that, no.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. All right, I'll get back in the queue. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Greg Lucier", "You bet.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Groberg with Macquarie Capital. You may proceed.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Hi, good morning. Just a couple questions. I was most interested in the comments, at least around the business and the outlook that you made, Mark on the research CE market that you think the decommissioning is done and that you actually expect stable revenues going forward. Can you just maybe describe kind of what you're hearing, why you're willing to say that and what you're assuming in terms of additional advances that are made in other kind of longer read, lower cost technologies going forward?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, we see most of the high throughput applications have already actually switched to next-generation sequencing. I mean just the tremendous progress that has been made in the short run technologies as they got longer both in comparative sequencing and de novo sequencing, that switch has already occurred. So the decommissioning that we're seeing and the transfer out of those experiments has actually occurred already.", "What we see in the research market is where people want to do a single experiment and perhaps look at a part of a genome and just do one run, instruments like the 3500 that we introduced that run into smaller labs, into smaller clinics is a very cost efficient way to run that out, to validate that sequence and then translate that into a clinical setting. So that's where we're seeing research applications and good pickup continue in that CE market and continuing to run CE instruments in that space. So that's why we feel comfortable about, as we've seen this year, the stabilization of that business. We're aware obviously of the long run technologies. Again, we'll talk about our single molecule technology coming in at the AGBT conference. We see a good place for that in the market, but it's complementary to other next-generation sequencing tools. We think it's also complementary to CE. We'll be able to have the full breadth across CE short and long runs as we go forward here.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "So if I take what you've said in the past about the CE research business, it's maybe somewhere around a 430, $450 million business for you, which is a pretty substantial business. You're saying that regardless of newer technologies, advances, you think that's about the rate at which that market will stay, the CE research market, using CE technology?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yeah. What you have to keep in mind with your numbers in the market is as we see the CE applications continue to get used into more clinical applications, that validation like we've done on the 3500 to get a CE-IVD mark and now in discussions to take the CE into a 510(k), those applications continue to get into more translational applications into the clinic, and that's when CE is a robust and proven technology. Particularly for a quick experiment, that's exactly what you want to use, the right fit for that application.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Thanks for clarifying the view there. Then just one more on sequencing if I can. On the SOLiD, can you maybe describe two things; one, you've had you and your competitor both introducing systems that are going to make significant advancements here. A lot of promises more towards the back half of the year, I guess. How does that dynamic play in the near term in terms of how you think customers are going to go about purchasing instruments? Does this delay purchases towards the back half of the year? You described what entailed going from the 3 to the 4. Can you maybe just describe as you go from the 4 to the hq what kind of upgrades you need to go to these smaller beads that you described?", "Greg Lucier", "Well, we don't see the market slowing down here in the first half of 2010. I think our announcement here with Ignite is a good example that this is a very robust market. In terms of what's driving it, for us the message is really around accuracy, that the technology is now taking us to a point where you can do really important translational research and accuracy is the key element when you're doing this sequencing. So we see that opportunity opening up here in 2010 for our organization.", "In terms of the upgrade to hq, I'll defer to my colleagues here. Again, it's not a very expensive upgrade once you're into SOLiD 4, which as you heard from SOLiD 3 Plus to 4 is only about $10,000. So we've tried to make this very economical for our installed base. We've continued to tell our customers that the SOLiD platform, the SOLiD technology has still lots of runway from here. As they invest in us, we invest in them.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yeah. I think that I'd just add that what you're not seeing here is any discontinuance of a platform, the switch. So the customers don't feel as they move up that they need any switch. So they continue to invest. They'll invest in SOLiD 4, and later in the year, they can add this upgrade which will add the extra smaller beads on. So they see a path and they just want to get going. They feel now is the time to get sequencing.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Like on the smaller beads, when you talk about an upgrade, do they have to replace a camera or anything like that in terms of the optic side of things? I'm just curious what exactly they upgraded.", "Mark Stevenson", "There may be smaller engineering upgrades that go as we've done in the past with SOLiD 3 to 3 Plus, but there's nothing significant that they'll need to upgrade in this.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Then, lastly and I'll jump in the queue. On pricing, can you maybe talk about what you've realized in 2009, kind of on average for the year? If that was any different than previous years, given the merger here with AB? Then whether or not you expect anything different in 2010?", "David Hoffmeister", "In previous years we've said we've realized somewhere between one to 2% in net price, and that's about what we got this year. We were very pleased with the pricing impact we were able to get on the AB side of the business. We're going to continue that going forward. Our outlook for 2010 is another one to 2% in realized price.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Great. Thanks a million for the detail.", "Eileen Pattinson", "All right. Thank you. We've run out of time, and this concludes our Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2009 Earnings Conference Call. This webcast will be available via a replay on our website for three weeks.", "As a reminder, we will be hosting a follow-up Q&A call for investors and analysts at 11:00 Eastern Standard Time. You can find dial-in information on the Investor Relations website and in the press release issued this morning.", "Thank you again for joining us this morning.", "Operator", "This concludes today's presentation.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and, Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our Web site, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcast and Presentations until February 26th. A copy of the press release of our fourth quarter 2009 earnings and future expectations is available on our Web site under the heading Financial Results.", "But before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 26th, 2009 under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and available in the Investors section of our Web site under the heading SEC Filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change, and therefore you should not rely upon these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during the call today, we will be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2009 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our Web site under the heading Financial Results.", "So with that, I'd like to now turn the call over to Marc.", "March Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, every one, and thank you for joining us for our review of our 2009 results and our outlook for 2010. I feel good about our performance in 2009 and how our employees handled the challenges we faced in a difficult economy. While no company was completely spared from the impact, I\u2019m pleased to say that Thermo Fisher Scientific weathered it very well.", "We successfully executed on our strategy for navigating through these tough times and achieved the goals we set out to accomplish. As a result of this focused execution and the tremendous efforts of our employees across the world, we achieved our financial goals for the quarter and year coming in at high end of our adjusted EPS guidance for 2009.", "Now let me address these actions in greater detail. We took significant costs out of the company. In fact, we took out more than the previously stated $115 million we targeted for the year. During 2009, we initiated the closure of 50 manufacturing sites incremental to our normal run rate. We reduced headcount and we managed discretionary costs extremely tightly. We anticipate that the combination of these actions will benefit us by an additional $25 million in 2010.", "We maintained our commitment to innovation. We spent nearly $250 million in R&D in 2009, the same level of investment we made in 2008, and launched a very strong suite of products during the year. I\u2019ll talk more about that later.", "We continue to expand in Asia. We built on our leading presence by adding about 225 people in China and India last year. We also enhanced our commercial capabilities there to investments and information technology.", "We made strategic acquisitions to complement our capabilities, and we were very disciplined in our approach. We deployed $650 million to acquire seven companies. You probably know of the two largest, Biolab and B.R.A.H.M.S. Biolab gave us leading customer channels in Australia and New Zealand. And B.R.A.H.M.S. added innovative biomarker tests to our growing specialty diagnostic portfolio. The others are small, but promising businesses that straightened our technology positions in gas chromatography, microbiology, and diagnostics, and extended our customer channels in Europe.", "We continue to invest in our people. Unlike many companies, we gave our employees merit increases last year, and that will pay significant dividends going forward. Our employees are energized and determined to regain our growth momentum moving into 2010.", "And financially, we delivered sequential improvement as the year progressed. And primary end markets began to recover. In the third quarter, we returned to adjusted EP S growth. In the fourth quarter, our EPS growth was even better, and we delivered organic revenue growth as well.", "Let me review our results in a little more detail before moving on to our outlook for 2010. For the fourth quarter, revenues were a record $2.8 billion for the quarter, 7% higher than 2008. As I mentioned, I\u2019m pleased to report that we returned to organic growth coming in at 1%. As we said last quarter, consumables are back to growing at historical rates. We also saw growth in services, which reverses the decline we had been seeing in the first three quarters of the year. Sales of instruments and equipment improved sequentially, but have not yet returned to growth.", "We continue our trend of sequential margin improvement, although our adjusted operating margin declined 60 basis points year-over-year. This was primarily due to two factors. One, our productivity in cost actions were more than offset by adverse mix; and second, we had the initial impact of lower margins for the businesses we acquired.", "We were very pleased on the other hand to achieve 5% growth in adjusted EPS over Q4 of 2008 to $0.91, leading to solid growth in EPS during the second half of the year. Free cash flow was another bright spot. We generated a $461 million in the quarter, $100 million more that Q4 last year. So the full year revenues came in at $10.1 billion, a 4% decrease from 2008. Organically, revenues declined 3%. Adjusted operating margin declined by 80 basis points to 17%. Adjusted EPS came in at $3.05, which was the high end of our guidance range.", "Last, we finished the year with record free cash flow generating over $1.4 billion. Just to remind you, we spent $650 million on acquisitions and $450 million on buybacks in 2009. So relative to market conditions, we performed well, and we are in a stronger position than many companies going into 2010.", "Let me talk a little bit about what we\u2019re seeing in our primary end markets as we move into a new year. In BioPharma markets, we\u2019re seeing gradual improvement. We continue to gain share with our top 20 accounts, which are mostly BioPharma customers as growth in these groups significantly outpaces the average growth of the company. It\u2019s clear that our strategy, based on the unique value proposition we can offer our customers, is working.", "The economic climate has actually been good catalyst for change that should benefit our business model. We\u2019re gaining share because we have a portfolio unlike any other company in our industry. In addition, we continue to innovate with the focus on the advanced technologies and productivity improvements our customers want and need, especially in times like this. Even in the face of tight budgets, this unique combination continues to create significant opportunities for us.", "In government and academic markets, global stimulus programs are the biggest story. We've said all along that we expect to benefit between $100 million and $200 million here. We recorded revenues of approximately $50 million tied to global stimulus programs in 2009, primarily from Japan and China for forensic and environmental market applications. We anticipate receiving another $50 million to $150 million in revenues from global stimulus purchases this year as the fall money starts to increase here in the United States.", "In healthcare, sales of our consumable products to US hospitals continue to grow. In particular, we saw a strong demand for flu tests provided by our microbiology business and through our healthcare channel.", "Finally, industrial markets, last quarter I described them as bouncing along the bottom, but now they seem to have stabilized. We do believe we\u2019ve seen the worst and we should even start to see some growth here. As you know, the nature of our instrumentation sales to industrial markets is that they will likely lag general industrial economic growth typically by two or three quarters. So that is the way to think about the pace of recovery here. We're seeing some signs of a pickup in the macro industrial end market. If that is sustained, we should see improved demand towards the end of 2010. At a minimum, the year-over-year comparisons will certainly get easier.", "So as we look ahead, we are excited about the many prospects we have as the world leader in serving science. We had our annual leadership meeting about a month ago with our top 230 managers in the company. This was my first leadership meeting in the role of CEO. And it was inspiring to see how energized the team is about the opportunities we have for 2010 and beyond.", "We\u2019re incredibly focused on getting back to our long term track record of growth. To achieve our goals for 2010, we focused on four priorities. One, investing to drive sustainable top line growth; second, leveraging our unique value proposition; third, expanding our operating margins; and fourth, deploying our capital to create shareholder value.", "Let me briefly touch on each one, first, investing to drive sustainable top line growth. We backtracked in 2009 because of the economy, and we plan to get back on track in 2010. We have many opportunities to grow. We serve attractive end markets. Life sciences and healthcare, which I touched on earlier, offer excellent prospects for us. Let me remind you this represents over two-thirds of our business. Environmental markets, especially air quality monitoring, will continue to offer growth as well. The opportunity right now is in developing markets like China and India. But we are optimistic that we\u2019ll see growth again in the US given the encouraging regulatory enforcement outlook and the fact that climate change may be back on the government agenda.", "We are committed to innovation. We have some excellent examples in 2009. You heard me talk about our new Thermo Scientific LTQ Velos mass spectrometry platform for example. Velos products have had the fastest uptake of any new mass spec product we've ever launched. You\u2019ll see an impressive line of new products from us, both the PITTCON and analytical over the next couple of months.", "Given our track record of successful new product introductions, we are going to increase our investment in R&D this year by approximately $30 million. This is in addition to the natural increase in R&D that occurs when we acquire new businesses. We believe that exciting growth prospects \u2013 we believe that the exciting growth prospects for our leading technology platforms, such as new applications from ASPAC, and new capabilities in specialty diagnostics and biosciences, easily justify these investments.", "We will also accelerate our expansion in Asia. We generated about $1 billion of revenue in Asia today, and have about 3,000 employees there. But there's still plenty of room to grow, especially in China and India. We are in the process of building our second demo lab in China. It will be located in Beijing close to the large universities and government research labs. We\u2019re also setting up a laboratory supply chain in Singapore to support the region\u2019s growing needs.", "Another priority is to leverage or unique value proposition for our customers. And our focus here is to continue to grow at our top 20 accounts at a pace faster than the company average. We will partner with our customers to drive behavioral change, helping them to standardize the way they equip their laboratories and research facilities.", "Through our Lean Lab program, we can help our customers improve productivity, and that is really gaining traction in this economy. We will also leverage our applications expertise across the company to help customers create more efficient workflows for testing the safety of food or performing stem cell research for example.", "Expanding operating margins is also a top priority. We will continue to manage our cost base tightly. Spending money only the most important initiatives, whether it's R&D or IT systems that yield the highest return on investment. We\u2019ll continue to optimize our infrastructure reducing our footprint while expanding our presence in low cost regions.", "And of course PPI, our Practical Process Improvement program, is well-engraved in the company and the way we do business here. Our track record on operating margins prior to 2009 was very consistent. And we plan to return to expanding operating margins this year.", "Last, but an equally important priority, is to effectively deploy our capital, to strengthen our portfolio, and extend our leadership position. We will continue to utilize our strong balance sheet to create long term shareholder value. We\u2019re off to a good start in this regard. In mid-January, we signed an agreement to acquire Ahura Scientific, a leading innovator in handheld spectroscopy instruments. With this portfolio of handheld instruments for chemical analysis and for the health and public safety applications, Ahura Scientific is an excellent complement to our breadth of handheld and benchtop elemental analysis process. This acquisition will accelerate our ability to offer customers an unmatched set of tools for laboratory quality analysis in the field.", "And on Monday of this week, we announced our agreement to acquire Finnzymes, which strengthens our offerings for molecular biology applications. Finnzymes is a provider of high performance PCR solutions. The acquisition augments our portfolio with an integrated suite of bioreagents, consumables, and instruments for improved PCR workflows in genomic research, genetic testing, forensics, and flu testing. We expect both of these acquisitions to close in Q1.", "So now, let me turn to a high level summary of our outlook for 2010 before I hand the call to Pete to give you more details. Based on what we\u2019re seeing in our primary end market today and our key assumptions for the year, which Pete will outline, we expect to grow revenues by 5% to 7% in 2010 to a range of $10.60 billion to $10.80 billion. That should translate to organic growth of between 2% to 4%. We expect to achieve adjusted EPS growth of 8% to 13% to a range of $3.30 to $3.45. So even though the economy at this point of the year is still far from robust, our outlook is positive and we\u2019re pleased to get back on the path of growth.", "Now I\u2019d like to hand the call over to our CFO, Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Pete Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we\u2019re pleased to report solid improvement in our earnings per share for the fourth quarter with 5% growth as of $0.91, compared to $0.87 last year. Full year adjusted EPS was $3.05, down 3%, versus $3.13 last year, and at the high end of our previous guidance of $2.95 to $3.05. GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.65, down from $0.67 in the prior year\u2019s quarter.", "Moving on to the details of our financial results, reported revenues in Q4 increased 7% year-over-year to $2.84 billion. Organic revenue growth was 1% in the quarter, excluding foreign currency translation of positive 3% and another 3% from acquisitions. We had one more day in the quarter compared to last year as a result of our fiscal calendar, which primarily benefits our consumables revenue.", "Our Q4 results continue our trend of good sequential improvement and organic revenue growth. Compared to Q3, we maintained mid single digit growth in consumables, returned to growth and services, and improved to a mid single digit decline in instruments and equipment from a high single digit decline in Q3.", "Full year revenues were $10.11 billion, a 4% decline from our 2008 revenues of $10.50 billion. Full year organic revenues declined 3%, excluding foreign currency translation of negative 2% and positive 1% from acquisitions. For the full year, we had one less day in 2009 as a result of the leap year in 2008. Bookings exceeded revenues in the quarter by 3% and by 1% for the full year.", "By segment, analytical technologies Q4 revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and declined 2% organically. We saw improvement in demand for our instruments, specifically those serving industrial markets, and continued to see good sequential improvement in the quarter across all our businesses. Our specialty diagnostics and biosciences businesses had solid growth in the mid to high single digits. And new products continued to be a growth driver, specifically in our scientific instrument product line. For the full year, analytical technologies declined 7% on a reported basis and 6% organically.", "In laboratory products and services segment, Q4 revenues increased 9% on a reported basis and 5% organically. During the quarter, we a saw solid growth in our laboratory consumables, BioPharma services, and catalogue businesses. For the full year, revenues in laboratory products and services were essentially flat, both on a reported basis and organically.", "Looking at organic growth by geography, we saw North America return to positive growth in a low single digit this quarter. Asia Pacific continued to see strong growth in the high single digits driven by both China and India. The rest of the world rebounded to double digit growth driven by strong demand in the Middle East. Europe declined mid-single digits against the tougher comparison of mid single digit growth in the prior year and continued softness in capital equipment. For the full year, North America declined slightly more than the company average, and Europe declined in the mid single digits. Asia Pac and the rest of the world have positive growth in the low single digits.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, Q4 increased 4% year-over-year to $510 million. Adjusted operating margin was 18%, down 60 basis points from our record 18.6% in the year ago quarter. Q4 adjusted operating margin again showed considerable improvement sequentially, up 70 basis from Q3 \u2013 70 basis points from Q3, driven by continued productivity and cost reduction actions.", "On a year-over-year basis, we also generated strong productivity. However, that was more than offset by adverse segment and product mix, realized price increases less than inflation, excess in obsolete inventory reserves related to site consolidations, and investment to support commercial expansion. Also our recent acquisitions lowered our adjusted operating margin in the quarter by about 15 basis points.", "For the full year, adjusted operating margin contracted by 80 basis points to 17% as compared to 17.8% in the prior year. By segment, analytical technologies Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 2% year-over-year. And adjusted operating margin was 21.8%, down 50 basis points versus 22.3% last year. For the full year, analytical technologies adjusted operating margin decreased 120 basis points to 20.2%.", "Laboratory products and services Q4 adjusted operating income increased by 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, down 60 basis points versus 14.7% in the 2008 quarter. For the full year, laboratory products and services adjusted operating margin contracted 50 basis points to 13.7%.", "Moving to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 41.5% in Q4, flat with the year ago quarter, and up 30 basis points from the previous quarter as a result of volume leverage and the impact of our sourcing and productivity initiatives. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 41.1%, down 20 basis points from 41.3% in the prior year.", "Adjusted SG&A was 21.1% of revenue in Q4, up 50 basis points from 20.6% in the year ago quarter driven by investments to support commercial expansion and our recent acquisitions. For the full year, adjusted SG&A percent of revenue increased 60 basis points to 21.7%.", "R&D expense was 2.4% of revenue in Q4, up 0.1% from last year. For the full year, R&D expense was $246 million or 2.4%, essentially flat with the prior year as we maintained our spending level for technology development to continue building our new product pipeline for future growth.", "Finally, as Marc mentioned, we executed well against the cost reduction plan than we laid out at our May analyst meeting. Exceeding our $115 million cost reduction goal for 2009. We anticipated these actions will benefit us by an additional $25 million year-over-year in 2010 consistent with our original plan.", "Moving below the line, our Q4 adjusted net interest expense increased $3 million year-over-year to $26 million, reflecting a much less favorable interest income environment. Other income was a loss of $2 million, $1 million more than the prior year, primarily as a result of currency transaction losses on foreign entity cash.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the year for the full year was 20%, equal to our full year estimate at the end of Q3, and down 70 basis points from Q4 2008, primarily as a result of the tax planning that we implemented late in 2008 and all of 2009, along with lower overall pretax income, particularly in the higher tax jurisdictions.", "Average diluted shares were $422 million for the quarter, down $5 million from last year, primarily as a result of the $500 million share buyback program we completed in Q2 of 2009. For the full year, average diluted shares were $423 million, down $12 million from $435 million in 2008.", "In terms of the balance sheet, our cash flow performance was exceptionally strong in Q4. Full year free cash flow was $1.47 billion or 114% of adjusted net income after deducting net capital expenditures of $194 million. This was a record year for us and we exceeded our 2008 free cash flow by almost $300 million, primarily as a result of working capital improvement and lower net capital expenditures.", "We ended the year with $1.57 billion in cash and investments, down $185 million from Q3, primarily as a result of acquisitions and a net impact of the debt refinancing we completed in Q4, partially offset by our strong free cash flow. Our total debt was $2.18 billion, up $159 million from Q3, primarily as a result of our debt refinancing.", "Moving on to working capital, we had excellent performance in the quarter. Accounts receivable days outstanding were 45 days, down 8 days from Q3 and 5 days from the prior year. Inventory days of supply were 61 days, down 10 days from Q3 and 7 days from the prior year. Our working capital benefited in the quarter by a couple of days as a result of our fiscal calendar and foreign exchange movements late in the quarter. But we also made considerable, tangible progress. These improvements are mostly sustainable, but they also set a high bar for our cash flow metrics in 2010.", "Moving on to our future guidance, we\u2019re initiating a 2010 revenue guidance range of $10.60 billion to $10.80 billion, which represents 5% to 7% growth, compared to our 2009 reported revenues of $10.11 billion. This guidance includes a little more than 1.5% growth from past acquisitions and divestitures and assumes no future acquisitions and forward divestitures. It also assumes present foreign currency exchange rates, which would have a favorable impact of a little less than 1.5% on our revenue growth. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates.", "On an organic basis, our guidance range represents growth 2% to 4%. At the midpoint, we expect both segments to have positive organic growth with slightly higher growth than the laboratory products and services segment.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, we\u2019re initiating a 2010 guidance range of $3.30 to $3.45, which represents 8% to 13% growth over the 2009 adjusted EPS of $3.05.", "To give you a little more detail on our earnings guidance, following are some of the key assumptions included in our guidance. First, adjusted operating margin expansion of 40 basis points to 80 basis points, compared to 2009. Positive contributors to our margin expansion are pull through on organic revenue growth and marginal rates; the full year benefit of our 2009 structural cost action and the completion of facility closures initiated in 2009; practical process improvement and lean and low cost region manufacturing; global sourcing net of direct material inflation, including low cost region sourcing and pricing, although we expected this amount to be lower than in past years as a result of a tougher pricing environment, primarily on capital equipment; headwinds that will unfavorably impact our margin expansion; our salary increases and other inflation; one-time 2009 cost actions, such as furloughs and short term discretionary cost controls, a portion of which will reverse in 2010; slightly higher stock compensation expense; and, increased investments in a few key strategic areas, in R&D to accelerate long term growth, primarily in our mass spectrometry, specialty diagnostics, and biosciences products in selling and marketing, primarily in emerging markets, but also to optimize our European commercial infrastructure, and in information technology, primarily related to our Thermo Scientific Web site and ERP implementation, so viewing these investments as deploying our capital and expect to earn a significant return from them, primarily beyond 2010.", "Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting the current weak interest rate environment to continue. But our Q4 2009 refinancing and higher average cash balance in 2010 will result in about $30 million of improvement in our net interest expense year-over-year. Our guidance is based on an adjusted income tax rate of 21.5%, up from 20% in 2009, primarily as a result of higher income marginal rates.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $420 million to $425 million, essentially flat with 2009. Consistent with past practice, our adjusted EPS guidance does not include any other significant assumptions with regard to future acquisitions or divestitures, share buybacks, or other external uses of our capital. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $275 million to $300 million.", "Finally, some additional items that will affect our revenue growth. We previously announced that (inaudible) Biosite will terminate our supply agreement with them effective June 30 of 2010. We estimate that this will lower our 2010 revenue by approximately $130 million, offset by about $40 million of revenue from an alternative supplier, for a net reduction of $90 million or about 0.9%. The H1N1 Flu had a positive impact of $50 million on our revenue in 2009, resuming a normal flu season in 2010, which would lower revenues by about $30 million year-over-year or 0.3%. Global stimulus programs, as Marc mentioned, added about $50 million to our revenue in 2009. We\u2019re expecting $150 million of global stimulus revenues in 2010, which would contribute about 0% to 1% growth year-over-year.", "Our Q1 2010 fiscal calendar has four more days than Q1 2009, and our Q4 2010 calendar has four less days than Q4 2009. This shift will have an impact on our year-over-year revenue comparisons in those two quarters, primarily in consumables. And lastly, the anniversary date of our Biolab acquisition is April 30th, and the B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition was completed on October 1st. Neither acquisition will factor into our organic growth until their respective anniversary dates.", "So in summary, we\u2019re excited about our growth prospects for 2010 and beyond. And we believe we\u2019ll continue to strike the right balance between prudent cost management and growth investments to maximize long term shareholder value.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) In order to allow everyone in the queue an opportunity to address the Thermo Fisher Scientific management team, I would like to ask that you limit your time on the call to one or two questions. If you have additional questions, please return to the queue and pose your question in turn.", "Our first question comes from Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Hi. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So it seems like the business is seeing some pretty substantial improvement in some of the end markets and it feels as if you guys sound pretty conservatively optimistic here on the trends as we had into 2010. So if we\u2019re to look at what we\u2019re seeing in the end market versus where the guidance is, where do you think the biggest leverage points are in terms of if the economy were to continue to improve at the rate we\u2019re seeing, with obviously, GDP growth coming in pretty strong and hopefully strong for the first quarter? Where do you think the key leverage points are to drive us to the upper end of the guidance and potentially beyond as we head into 2011, both from an end market perspective as well as some of the investments that you\u2019re making in the business?", "Marc Casper", "So, Ross, in terms of the positive factors that could lead to the higher end of the guidance, clearly stimulus coming in stronger than we had forecast would be one area. As we looked at stimulus, we feel good about the range that we had given back in April of last year. Japan and China have been particularly strong. In the US, there\u2019s clearly activity going on, but the money\u2019s actually falling relatively slowly. So that could be an upside towards the higher end. I would also then say on the industrial side, depending on how GDP growth picks up, that would also be a driver.", "On an encouraging front, we are seeing our services business in industrial customers starting to improve, which is a sign that the instruments and equipment are being utilized, and that\u2019s the very first indicator of an improving situation. So I think those are the two big drivers that one would think about getting to the higher end of the growth rate.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thanks. And just one additional question, as we think about where the balance sheet\u2019s positioned today, how are we thinking about \u2013 in an improved environment leverage levels and optimum capital management in terms of what you need to drive the type of returns in this business that you\u2019d like to deliver to shareholders. And to that, you talked about improved M&A environment. You guys have executed on that more recently. What should we expect in 2010 in terms of that and to be the focus?", "Marc Casper", "Ross, if you look back historically, and I think that also is the way we think about it going forward as well, which is we\u2019re very focused on using the company\u2019s strong cash flow generation and strong balance sheet to create shareholder value.", "As I said in the past, we had an interesting M&A environment over the last \u2013 just a year or so which is \u2013 there was very little activity in the first half of 2009 because nobody wanted to sell their company, if you will, off of the low valuations of 2008. You\u2019re starting to see a modest pickup in activity, not dramatic, but we did with B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition last year. We\u2019ve done two private deals in January and February that our companies that we\u2019re probably thinking about selling, but really had to wait until there was a window. So you\u2019ll see some activity in our industry, I think, during the course of this year. And for those acquisitions that really meet our criteria of dramatically strengthening our portfolio and generating a real return for our shareholders, you\u2019ll see us to be active from that perspective.", "In terms of leverage ratios and those things, obviously we focus on making sure that we\u2019re creating value and we continue to look at our balance sheet to make sure we\u2019re deploying it wisely.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai of Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on the nice quarter.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Quintin. Good morning.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Again, just following up a little bit on the industrial pick-up. Marc, are there any other initiatives that are out there that may be not in your guidance, but things like alternative energy or nuclear power potential that could impact Thermo?", "Marc Casper", "I would say that longer term, there are a couple of things on the regulatory front and the government investment front that are really good positive catalysts. But I\u2019m not really believing that that\u2019s going to dramatically affect 2010.", "Nuclear\u2019s quite interesting for us, but as primarily the expansion in China. We picked up a very large order at a new facility in the fourth quarter that shifts over a multi-year timeframe, but it gives us a sense of the power of our (inaudible) business in the nuclear industry. And I think that is encouraging, but that is a multi-year benefit.", "Air quality is the other one I mentioned briefly in my comment, which is effectively, as governments get more concerned about global warming, that\u2019s a really positive for our air monitoring business. We are by far the industry leader in emissions monitoring. And whenever you hear about more regulations and things that come out of a smoke stack, typically you can think of Thermo Fisher benefiting from that. So again, those are really good catalysts, but probably not very significant in 2010.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "Thank you. And then I remember at the start of 2009 we talked about a Q1 de-stocking. So actually, if you look at 1% organic revenue growth that you posted in this last quarter, was that against maybe a potentially tougher comp last year? Do you think there might have been some stocking in the fourth quarter of 2008?", "Marc Casper", "Pete, why don't you answer that.", "Pete Wilver", "Okay, Quintin, so on the consumable side, I don\u2019t think there is a shift from Q1 to Q4 last year. I think that was solely a Q1 event. But certainly on the equipment side, we actually hung on to our growth longer than some other companies and had a relatively strong Q4 in terms of total organic growth for the company of 4%. So that was actually a pretty good number given the environment that we\u2019re in last year. But I would say it was probably more on the instrument side than it was on the consumable side.", "Quintin Lai \u2013 Robert W. Baird", "All right. Thank you.", "Marc Casper", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hey, good morning. And Marc, congrats on the quarter as well.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Tycho. Good morning.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "I think last quarter you had talked about regarding stimulus, a 50% capture rate on the grants around mass spec. Can you talk a little bit about whether that\u2019s holding? And then also, you talked about reinvesting in mass spec, if you could talk about that and maybe also the competitive dynamic, obviously, with Danaher and (inaudible) getting a little bit more active in the market, that\u2019d be helpful.", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So a couple of different points, to address. One, is in terms of the stimulus funds capturing mass spec orders, the way that I would look at it is that we launched our new suite of mass spectrometers, the Velos platform and ASNS in the middle of last year and that has \u2013 in the fastest uptake of any product that we\u2019ve ever launched is mass spec. And our Orbitrap franchise had record bookings last year. So we\u2019re seeing very strong demand. A lot of those grants were written around our technology. A lot of that money hasn\u2019t yet turned into orders for anybody. We\u2019re confident in the competitive position of our technology. I\u2019m particularly excited by the fact that the typical grant allocation of $500,000 was increased to $600,000, which really phased well into the Orbitrap family. So we feel very good about that position.", "In terms or R&D, we had a firm commitment last year to maintain our R&D expenditure because of the great track record that we\u2019ve had in bringing out innovative products. Even though the end markets were tough, we maintained that commitment. As we look at the opportunities going into 2010 and certainly going into 2011 and '12, we\u2019re very excited about what our technologies can be used for, and we're making a conscious decision to increase our spending by about $30 million, not just for mass spec, but also to strengthen our products and specialty diagnostics and biosciences to go after new applications that we think can accelerate our long term growth. If you think about it, we could go out and spend $30 million on a technology acquisition. We think we're going to get a much higher return by putting the $30 million into our own R&D capabilities. We know the track record of our team. They're terrific. And we think it's going to be really a no-brainer in terms of the returns we'll get down the road.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "And then can you comment on the competitive dynamic and how you view the Web (inaudible)?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. There are always tough competitors out there in mass spectrometry. And what's great about mass spec is everybody claims that they've got the best and the most exciting, and I think that's fine. And you've heard us say in the past that we always like to have a lot of buzz in the market because that means there'll be more funding going into mass spec. I think our track record for itself in this area. We've gone from a distant player nine years ago to a market leader over that period in time. And we feel very good about our prospects. And we never sit back and rest in our (inaudible). We step up to the challenge that our competitors are putting out there. And we feel great about the technologies that we have.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And as we think about this year, and I know Pete talked about some of the operational leverage on the financial guidance, but can you talk about where you see the biggest opportunities? Is there additional headroom on PPI to roll that out across the company? Is it additional facility closures? Can you just talk about where you see some of the leverage in the model?", "Pete Wilver", "Hi, Tycho. I'll answer that. I would it's really on the organic growth side. So we're doing everything that we can do from a PPI standpoint. We certainly don't want to \u2013 I mean we can deliver more margin expansion in the short term by cutting back on those strategic investments that I and Marc talked about. But that's not where we would want to get additional margin expansion in 2010. It would really be just in terms of pull through on the incremental organic growth that's really the upside opportunity.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from John Wood [ph] of Jefferies & Company. Please proceed.", "John Wood \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Hey, thanks a lot. Pete, on the cash flow outlook, have you built the working capital assumptions in line \u2013 you ended 2009 basically at all-time lows on the inventory and receivables. Is that what you've modeled in 2010 or will you start to chew up a bit more working capital as you start to grow again?", "Pete Wilver", "My assumption in the guidance is that those metrics are ones that are going to be tough to duplicate in 2010. And even if we did, given the fact that we're going to grow, we will use additional working capital, so I'm assuming something in the range of $100 million in incremental working capital usage in 2010.", "John Wood \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. Great. And then on the CapEx, it seems like that's a bit ahead of the historical trend line at $250 million or so. Is that just catch up spend after spending less in 2009? Is that the right level to use beyond 2010?", "Pete Wilver", "Yes. I would say our average is going to be $250 million. That's basically what we did in 2008. Not consciously from our level, but in terms of the businesses, they had plenty on their plate to do in 2009. So they ended up spending a little bit less than what we would normally spend. So I would say 2010 is a little bit of a catch up year. So $250 million is a better run rate going forward.", "John Wood \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay, understood. And then, Marc, understanding your comments on the M&A side, is it a priority for you and/or the Board to communicate a more consistent strategy in terms of returning cash to shareholders? Or should we expect that in the absence of the M&A opportunities, stay tuned for what comes beyond that?", "Marc Casper", "The way I think about it is, we review this with our Board periodically. And we discuss the M&A landscape. We discuss various ways of returning capital to our shareholders. And periodically, if you look back over the last many years, we have returned capital to shareholders. And we really haven't done any forward communication in terms of that, so. At some point in time, we've had buyback authorizations. The other points in time, we don't. And that's been our approach. What I can say is we're always talking internally about what's the best way to generate returns for our shareholders, and we'll continue to do that.", "John Wood \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. You would expect the past strategy to continue for the foreseeable future in terms of the communication.", "Marc Casper", "Yes. In terms of how we communicate, yes. As things change, we'll certainly communicate that to our shareholders.", "John Wood \u2013 Jefferies & Company", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc Casper", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derek De Bruin of UBS. Please proceed.", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Hi. Good morning.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning.", "Pete Wilver", "Hi, Derek.", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Hey, just two quick questions. You mentioned that analytical technology to your equipment business was down \u2013 the equipment business was basically down mid single digits. Could you just give a little bit more breakdown on industrial equipment versus analytical instrumentation for laboratory usage? How do you model \u2013 what should we be thinking about that as we go into next year or going into 2010?", "Marc Casper", "Generally, we don't break it down with a lot of granularity by segments and markets. But it's clear that the industrial side was the weakest of that customer set, but improved in the fourth quarter. In a way, it's a positive, but it's still going to be the weakest part of our business where your pharmaceutical, and academic, and government customers are going to be a little bit stronger in terms of where those instrument sales were in the last (inaudible).", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Okay. And just another question, so on the \u2013 on looking through Asian investments, could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing the growth opportunities in Asia. Could you just do a little bit more \u2013 is it mostly industrials investment now by the domestic \u2013 but domestic industries, are they starting to invest in the academe? Can you just talk about how you see the Asians rolling out in terms of domestic investment, multinationals, (inaudible) in different markets and what you're doing?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. The two biggest markets for growth are clearly China and India. I'll comment (inaudible) in a moment. In China, historically, you saw a big emphasis on infrastructure and industrial type demand. You are seeing a much bigger push into life sciences, primarily on the academic research side. And we do a lot of work with the Chinese Academy of Sciences, a lot of interesting stem cell work going on there that we are a big supplier to.", "So you're seeing that type of demand increase. You're seeing multinationals move more activity to China. You're seeing R&D spend go up, both the pharmaceutical and industrial companies (inaudible) equip new laboratories. And the reason we're putting it in the second demo lab is we want to tap into that growth.", "In India, you're seeing a continued push towards more clinical research being in India. We opened up a clinical packaging facility there. And you (inaudible) make investments to support. But still it's primarily life sciences and healthcare-related growth. Clearly, India needs a lot of infrastructure investments, but that has not been a \u2013 not as much of a driver yet.", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "In terms of other targets within the prospects of R&D spend in Korea, Taiwan are good as well and provide growth? Or those are still smaller opportunities than you would see in something like India and China? I just want to follow it up with this. Given that there are so many growth opportunities in Asia, it's like when or if it does the Chinese life sciences, which is still very (inaudible), when does that potential become a competitive challenge?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of local suppliers?", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Of local suppliers, yes.", "Marc Casper", "We monitor that closely. You see, local suppliers really are the very commodity-oriented type products. You don't see them in a significant way in instrumentation or life science research free agents. And part of the reason that we're building a very capable presence of manufacturing in low cost regions is to be able to compete whenever a new threat comes up. So we feel that our quality is world-class. And where they will take a very low cost in some of those markets and we'd expand our manufacturing to address that should that become a real threat. It's not a real threat today, but it's one that we keep a very close eye on.", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "And how much of your manufacturing is at the Asian focus right now (inaudible)?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of what we manufacture in Asia today, we manufacture about $253 million of (inaudible).", "Derek De Bruin \u2013 UBS", "Thank you.", "Marc Casper", "Sure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Marshall\u00a0Urist of Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Yes. Hi, guys. Good morning. So the first question was just on some of the assumptions and guidance. I know you've been asked about end markets. I was hoping maybe on that 2% to 4% organic you can help us to understand more explicitly what's the underlying assumption on the instrument side as well as what you're assuming for your industrial customers for '10 if you get to that 2% to 4%.", "Pete Wilver", "Sure. In terms of the consumables equipment services, we honestly don't rollout the company that way. It's much easier for us to do that on a backward look than a forward look. But if you go back to what we talked about as the (inaudible), we're pretty much in line with those numbers, which is consumables in the mid single digits growth, which is basically where we are already. We had equipment in the low single digits decline \u2013 mid single digits decline (inaudible) about flat. And then services in low single digits growth. So that's about where we are. Again, we don't rollout the data that way. But nothing has materially changed from what our assumptions were back at that point in time.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Sorry, and just to be clear from that then, you're saying looking forward then \u2013 it assumes that instruments are flat in '10?", "Pete Wilver", "I said yes, mid single digit decline to flat.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, got you. Great. And then again, would \u2013 just to be clear, would your industrial customers recovering, with that be upsize to those expectations?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. It depends on how strong the recovery. What we're assuming is a slow recovery that we benefit from late in the year just given the lag, we're thinking second half of the year is where we get some benefit from it. If you see a bigger pick up in GDP growth or you see it accelerating faster, that will be an upsize. On the flip side, if you don't see that recovery and the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter, we're anticipating that \u2013 it's something \u2013 if macro view gets worse, then obviously that would be a raise. But think of it as a gradual recovery forecast.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. And then just second question on price, given some of your comments that the pricing environment is getting difficult. Should we still be assuming that prices is a net positive? Or is it going to be more moving towards neutral if we think about the top line and also from a margin \u2013 gross margin perspective?", "Marc Casper", "Price is still a net positive in the range of about 1.5%. When you look at that, pricing is still strong on consumables, and that hasn't changed. What is changed a little bit, and this is not dramatic, is that the capital equipment on size of the market is a little bit more difficult to get priced than it was in years past. And that's not a surprise after a year where you've had across the industry volume declines. People really lump that volume and it's the normal part of the cycle. So we think that over time, that comes back to a stronger pricing environment. In the short term, that's a little bit more challenging, less so in high end instrumentation, more so in the mid range to lower end parts of the market.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay, got you. And one last one, just on the Biosite agreement, I'm just curious. Is it a goal? Are you guys working internally to offset more of that? Or is that what we should be thinking where things will be in the back half of the year when that rolls off?", "Pete Wilver", "Well the assumption that I gave, which is to lose about $130 million of revenue from the Biosite contract, and then to make up about $40 million from the alternative supplier. That's our best guess at this point in time. If you get that $40 million, we obviously have to do a lot of good execution in order to make that happen. Bringing on a new supplier is no small task. Of course, there could be some upside to that, but that's the midpoint of where we think we're going to end up.", "Marshall\u00a0Urist \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug\u00a0Schenkel of Cowen and Company. Please proceed.", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Hi. Good morning, and thanks for taking the questions.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning.", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Just a quick follow-up to one of Marshall's questions, on pricing, just to be clear, it sounds like you guys are still getting of a customary \u2013 or (inaudible) to get the customary couple of points on price this year. And if so, again, when do these price cuts \u2013 I'm sorry, these price increases get rolled through the system?", "Marc Casper", "In general, prices \u2013 most the pricing starts at the beginning of the year, not all of it does because some customers have contracts. So you get a little bit that rolls in throughout the year. But most of it starts at the beginning of the year. It's (inaudible) across the (inaudible).", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. And it's about a couple of points typically that you get on the consumable side, is that right?", "Marc Casper", "We'll probably have a little bit more and that translates to about 1.5% across the portfolio.", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. And then in Q3 of last year, the way I remember it is there's a delay in shipment at some analytical technology instrument, I think largely NASDAQ's, those got transitioned into the fourth quarter rendering the comp this year on that side a little bit more challenging than normal. Any chance you can just talk about what the magnitude of that headwind do you think turned out to be in the fourth quarter of this year.", "Pete Wilver", "It was around $15 million of revenue that shifted from Q3 to Q4 last year.", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Okay. And one last one, last year, we on the cell side got a little ahead of ourselves with our Q1 forecasts. This year, Q1 looks to be one of the most favorable comps we've seen with you guys for a while. In Q1 last year, you had days going against you. You had an uncharacteristic slowdown of the top 20 that counts. There was inventory de-stocking that was starting. The industrial end markets started to become a mess. This year, you got four days coming back. Recognizing you don't provide quarterly guidance, any commentary you can provide on how we should think about the seemingly very favorable dynamics in Q1? That will really be appreciated. Thank you.", "Pete Wilver", "I think you've laid it out pretty well. Certainly, Q1 is going to be one of the easier comparisons that we have in our history. And basically, I think you need to think about all of the things that you mentioned. The only thing that I would say is in terms of the calendar comp, the way to think to think about the calendar comp, it doesn't really impact us with one day. But when you think about four days, you need to think about that incremental revenue. Of course it's going to be organic growth. But it's like acquisition or foreign exchange revenue, it's going to pull through at our average rates, not the incremental rates you would expect for organic growth because we're adding fixed costs for four days as well. So that's the only caveat I would give. You need to think about it that way.", "Doug\u00a0Schenkel \u2013 Cowen and Company", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Lawson of Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.", "Patrick Mooney \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "This is actually Patrick Mooney filling in for Peter. Thanks for taking the question. You guys mentioned you're seeing some strong co-activity in the US stimulus, but not much is materializing in sales yet. How much of the $50 or $150 million boost in 2010 do you anticipate coming from the US? And when do you anticipate those funds being targeted?", "Marc Casper", "So there's not a precise number if I use geography. But certainly, the majority of it will come from the US market. And you'll also see a little bit in Europe and a little bit in China and Japan. It will be much \u2013 it will be very much towards instrumentation. So if you think about the bulk of the stimulus funds, it's around instruments. There's some follow on through equipment, some follow on through consumables. But think of it benefiting particularly on the (inaudible) the most.", "Patrick Mooney \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. And then the service \u2013 the return to growth, was that more a recovery on the industrial side? Or was Biopharma more willing to outsource some large projects in the quarter?", "Pete Wilver", "Biopharma Services business, as I mentioned, did have nice growth in the quarter. So that was one of the things that picked up the revenue growth profile in that side of the business. But we also saw it just started a normal service of upper instruments. It didn't return the growth, but it was basically flat in the quarter. And that was pretty much across the board. I can't say it can be attributed to one market segment over another.", "Patrick Mooney \u2013 Thomas Weisel Partners", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac\u00a0Ro of Leerink Swann. Please proceed.", "Isaac\u00a0Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning, guys.", "Pete Wilver", "Good morning.", "Isaac\u00a0Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "I think, guys, on the initial budget proposal the other day from the White House in inclusion of about another $800 million in incremental FDA funding for food safety. I think that's about 16% of your business, if I remember correctly. So I'm wondering how you think that might help or hinder your outlook for 2010 as that budget goes to the usual betting process in Congress.", "Marc Casper", "We think it's a smaller proportion of our expenditure to be in the single digits of the total company. And I think we commented a couple quarters ago, if you look at the food safety environment, you see a lot more activity in China and Europe, and Japan in terms of ensuring a safe food supply. So we think it's very encouraging for our industry as well as in particular if the US is going to be stepping funding in regulations. We have good relationships with the FDA. And we have had our team working with them on different technologies. So I feel good about our prospects. And given the success we've had in other markets, I think that should be a positive for us this year and beyond.", "Isaac\u00a0Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Great. Thanks. And then secondly, just looking at the assets you brought in specialty diagnostics, that was obviously a bright spot on the quarter and there're lots going on for this year as well. Could you maybe touch on the long term strategy that you have there to build off the current asset base that you have, and expectations for how that grows versus the overall business?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. When you look at our acquisition strategy, the larger things we do are going to be centered towards our analytical technology segment. We see great prospects across specialty diagnostics, analytical instruments, and bio sciences. And interestingly enough, although they are different sizes, we get three deals in one of each \u2013 one for each of those three businesses within the segment. So (inaudible) has really built out our biomarker capability in specialty diagnostics. Of course, it's a nice add on to analytical instruments giving a really good technology.", "It's very important in really safety applications. What that product does is it detects unknown samples, so used for airport screening, military applications, if you don't know what's in it, package of chemical liquids, you can tell what it is without destroying the product. And then the last one was (inaudible), which really strengthens our offering of our sciences. So you'll see us building our portfolios over time as the right deals are available where we can place shareholder value.", "Isaac\u00a0Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thank you. And very lastly, on just in-house versus distributed products, any thought on the long term goals for the mix between the two, and then maybe how you \u2013 how we should think about incremental margin benefits to the company as that mix progresses?", "Marc Casper", "Well each year, roughly, if you look at the mix of our channel business, we increase the self-manufacturer's portion of that by about a point a year. If you think about it, roughly, a third of that \u2013 of the catalogue and channel is self-manufactured product. This year, it goes up by about a point. So that's the basic view. And then obviously, we make a lot more money on our self-manufactured products than we do through our distributed products in that case.", "Isaac\u00a0Ro \u2013 Leerink Swann", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Marc Casper", "Welcome.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Butler of Barclays Capital. Please proceed.", "Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. Marc, you made comments about record mass spec in 2009. Could you quantify that a little bit more? Was that in units or was that in total revenues? And I have a couple of follow ups please.", "Marc Casper", "Sure. My comment was around both bookings, in terms of \u2013 and that would be in dollars as well as \u2013 as revenue continues to grow as well, so a very strong one on both (inaudible) and shipments.", "Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you. Two financial questions, if I may, the up margin guidance of 40 to 80 bits and the pull through from the organic revenues, that's sided to one business unit or the other lab products or analytical tech or is it equal?", "Pete Wilver", "In terms of the organic revenue growth?", "Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Yes, or as it turned to up margin improvement.", "Pete Wilver", "In terms of (inaudible) productivity actions and those types of things, I would say it's not weighted one way or another. But in terms of the organic growth pull through, at any point in our guidance, we're probably going to see higher growth and leverage to our products and services, and we're going to see in analytical technologies in 2010. And certainly, the gross margin is much higher in analytical technology than in laboratory products and services so that overall, we'll have somewhat diluted effects on our gross margins.", "Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Thank you. And then lastly, on the tax rate differences from the guidance in '10 from that of what was in 2009, does that imply or skewed to an increase in overall US revenue? Is that how you arrived at the higher tax rate?", "Pete Wilver", "It's not really a skew to US revenue. It's just simply that as we make \u2013 we have some tax planning that creates reductions in our taxes similar to a mortgage deduction. It's a fixed amount. And as our income goes up, all the incomes attached at incremental rates, whether it's happening in the US or internationally. So it's really just a \u2013 it's almost a mixed impact of having higher incremental income.", "Tony Butler \u2013 Barclays Capital", "Appreciate the time.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Operator, we're going to take one more caller.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon\u00a0Groberg of Macquarie Research. Please proceed.", "Jon\u00a0Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research", "Good morning. A quick question to you or Marc, whoever wants to answer. If you look at this quarter, both divisions, first quarter, I can see \u2013 (inaudible) where you had top line and organic was only about 1%, 1.5%. You didn't get the operating margins expansion year-over-year, and you laid out some reason why in this quarter. I'm just thinking for investors, as we think about longer term, those that might say, \"Look, after the Fisher merger, you just really can't get the leverage in the model that you've got in the past.\" Can you maybe just talk about those dynamics and how you see the margins story playing out over the next year or even two years?", "Pete Wilver", "I think the way to look at it is really the guidance that we've laid for 2010, which has basically low single digits organic growth, low to mid, and 40 basis points to 80 basis points of margin expansion, which is pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past. We've always been able to deliver in the past. As I mentioned, we are making some key strategic investments in 2010, which is a little bit of a dilution of that margin expansion, specifically in 2010. But as we see the benefits of those investments in terms of higher growth from new products in Asia and so forth, we'll certainly get that margin expansion back. So I don't think there's anything \u2013 we will see any difference long term in our thesis of being able to get close to 100 basis points of margin expansion on mid single digit organic growth. That's still where we see the capability on this business.", "Jon\u00a0Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research", "Is there some \u2013 maybe just to clarify, is there some minimal \u2013 I'm seeing (inaudible) this quarter. I know there's some (inaudible) that you're talking about. Is there some minimum amount of organic growth that you need in order to at least be flat in terms of year-over-year operating margins?", "Pete Wilver", "That's tough to say. I would say, we can deliver margin expansion with flat organic growth. The business can do that. But it depends on what the comparison is like. There are lots of things that happen in any given quarter. But there's no reason we couldn't deliver a small amount of margin expansion even with flat organic growth.", "Jon\u00a0Groberg \u2013 Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just a clarification, I guess, on the share count, I know you're buying back these converts. I'm just curious what's going into your assumptions for flat share count year-over-year. Thanks.", "Pete Wilver", "Well the reason we're assuming flat share count is we're \u2013 hopefully not optimistically, but assuming a higher stock price as we go through the year. And so as \u2013 we still do have converts. And so, as we increase the stock price, that increase is the option in convert solution going through time. So that ends up washing out the effects of the converts refinancing.", "Marc Casper", "So let me make a quick closing comment. We're very proud of how our employees performed in 2009 to achieve our goals. We successfully executed our plans in response to the economic environment. And at the same time, we continued to invest in the future. The actions we took positions very well for growth. I look forward to updating you on our progress as the year unfolds. Thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thank you.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

Welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific First Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. My name is Carmel, and I\u2019ll be your coordinator for today. At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions)", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning. And thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading Webcast and Presentations until May 21, 2010. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading financial results.", "So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks we may make about the company\u2019s future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company\u2019s Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2009, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and also available on the Investor section of our website under the heading SEC filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change and therefore you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also, during the call, we\u2019ll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So, with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us for a review of our first quarter results in 2010. We\u2019re pleased to report a strong start to the year with record revenue and EPS performance in Q1. I\u2019m incredibly proud of our teams and their determination in achieving our operating and financial goals for the quarter.", "Our production teams responded extremely well to increasing demands from our customers. Our commercial teams are making new connections for our customers across our portfolio to leverage our unique value proposition. And, as usual, we had strong results through practical process improvement or PPI which is how we increase productivity to better serve our customers around the world.", "All of this helped to continue the growth momentum we began in Q4 and puts us solidly on track to meet our goals for the year. We have emerged from the recession a stronger industry leader as a result of the actions we took in 2009, and that is clearly evident in our first quarter results.", "Let me give you a quick overview of our financial performance in Q1. We reported record first quarter revenues of $2.7 billion for the quarter, 19% higher than 2009. This translates to 13% organic growth, which was slightly better than we expected coming into the quarter.", "The easy comparison with the very weak quarter last year and four more calendar days also helped. Still, we had strong operating performance across the company with solid double-digit revenue growth in both of our reporting segments, Analytical Technologies and Laboratory Products and Services. We also recorded strong double-digit growth not only in Asia but in the North American markets as well.", "We\u2019re pleased to report that our adjusted operating margin returned to historic levels, improving by 200 basis points year-over-year to 17.5%. This was primarily due to pull-through from a strong topline revenue growth and the continuing benefit of our cost saving initiatives including our on-going focus on PPI and global sourcing.", "Last, we\u2019re pleased to report that our adjusted EPS results for the quarter were first quarter record at $0.84, a 35% improvement over 2009. So, all in all, it was an excellent quarter and a great start to the year.", "Let me spend a few minutes describing the conditions of our key end markets at this point. The take away here is that market trends are in line with our expectations and similar to what we experienced in Q4 of 2009.", "Let me give you a high-level view of what we\u2019re seeing four months into the year. In BioPharma markets, capital spending is still constrained but as we\u2019ve said before, we believe we have the ideal value proposition to support new operating models being put in place by pharma companies to improve their competitive positions. Our top 20 accounts showed strong double-digit organic growth in the quarter, ahead of the company\u2019s overall organic growth rate.", "Our announcement last month about our expanded relationship with Eli Lilly is a terrific example of how we\u2019re supporting these new models. We will be taking over responsibility for Lilly\u2019s in-house clinical trials materials manufacturing, packaging and labeling operations at their technology center in Indianapolis.", "The objective is to use our expertise to speed the delivery of innovative medicines to patients while helping Lilly to reduce of some its fixed costs, definitely a win-win for all parties.", "In government and academic markets, global stimulus programs had a positive impact on the quarter, particularly in our mass spectrometry business. We had over $60 million of stimulus sales in Q1, much of it coming from Japan and some of it from the United States.", "I want to know here that our performance in mass spec overall was incredibly strong in Q1 even beyond stimulus. Based on our stimulus-related sales and bookings so far this year, we fully expect to achieve our goal of $50 to $150 million in 2010 as we previously stated.", "Turning to healthcare, the landscape here is similar to what we saw in Q4. Moderate growth and consumables but still some constraints in capital spending, our results were in line with these dynamics.", "Our healthcare customer channels continues to face the Biosite headwinds and although our microbiology business was affected by the very light flu season, sales of our specialty diagnostic consumables overall showed solid growth in the quarter.", "Last, I\u2019ll cover industrial markets where obviously our comparisons with Q1 last year made for a much better quarter in our businesses that served this sector. Certain markets such as metals continue to lag. But overall, activity is largely as we expected, reflecting a slowly recovering economy.", "The fact that we saw a pickup in spare part sales tells us the capacity utilization is recovering across the industrial economy. However, it looks like it\u2019ll be a few quarters before we see the benefit of later cycle investments being made by our customers here.", "Let me now turn to some of the exciting developments of the past few months that will contribute to our growth momentum. Our proven strategy of continued investment and effective cost management gives us many opportunities for creating shareholder value. We have a number of excellent examples so far this year.", "First, we continued our leading track record of innovation. The first quarter is always a very active time for new product introductions and we stood out again this year at major industry tradeshows around the world.", "The overriding theme under our thermal scientific technology brand was this performance matters in driving bold progress for our customers, not only in the research laboratory but in a range of routine and field application. We were able to demonstrate our depth of capabilities, which results from our unique combination of technology leadership and applications expertise.", "In addition to exhibiting the most powerful new mass spectrometry research tools, we introduced a range of instruments and consumables designed specifically for routine testing. For example, our new TSQ Quantum XLS and ISQ single quad systems deliver industry-leading performance of food testing, forensics and environmental applications.", "We also launched an innovative web-based software system called LIMS-on-Demand so customers connect all aspects of their laboratory operations without having to make significant investments in a traditional laboratory information management system. This brings enterprise-wide functionality to our customers who are running small to mid-sized labs.", "In another promising development, just after quarter end, we now see opening of a food safety response center at our Dreieich facility in Germany. This is the first global food testing laboratory devoted specifically to containing costly and life threatening chemical contamination.", "You probably recall the melamine crisis that started in China and led to economic and health ramifications all over the world. Our center is strategically located near Europe\u2019s leading food safety research institutions. It features a team of experts working with state-of-the-art thermo-scientific analytical instruments to rapidly develop methods that can be replicated by regulators, contract testing labs and food producers to screen for contaminants and contain a potential crisis.", "We also built on our progress and presence in China where we reported strong double-digit growth. I traveled to China at the end of March to visit of some our operations and key customers. And the continued growth in various markets reinforces our strategy of on-going expansion in the region. I\u2019ll give you three examples that illustrate the range of opportunities there.", "First, China is investing heavily in multiple forms of energy production. Over the next 10 years, the country plans to build more than half of the world\u2019s new capacity, mostly in the form of nuclear power.", "In Q1, we won a multi-million dollar order to provide radiation monitoring equipment for plant and worker safety. We expect to ship these products in 2011 and 2012. This positions us to be a key participant in this high growth market. You may recall that we moved the headquarters of our environmental instruments business to Shanghai well over a year ago to focus on opportunities just like this.", "Second, companies of many industries are building new R&D labs in China. During the quarter, we won significant orders to equip labs for a multi-national petrochemical customer, a leading CRO, as well as a major Chinese pharmaceutical company. These customers chose us because of the range of technologies and choices we offer along with our expertise in laboratory operations.", "Last, we launched our PCT biomarker for sepsis which we recently gained through our B-R-A-H-M-S acquisition to the Chinese healthcare market.", "The last point I want to highlight, is that we continue to deploy our balance sheet to create shareholder value. We closed the acquisitions of Ahura Scientific and Finnzymes during the quarter, which added new hand held technologies and PCR work flows to our offering. And just after quarter end, we acquired Proxeon, a supplier of products for proteomics applications.", "Located in Denmark, Proxeon is recognized for its ability to offer a simplified proteomics workflow based on nanoflow chromatography technology. This LCMS solution complements our leading portfolio of proteomics tools based on our ion trap and hybrid capabilities.", "To recap our acquisition activities, we have spent more than $260 million year-to-date on complimentary acquisitions. We will continue to use our disciplined approach to evaluate on-going opportunities that we believe will create additional shareholder value.", "Last week, we also announced a $750 million stock buyback authorization and we took advantage of current favorable conditions in the debt capital markets to refinance some of our debt. Pete will provide a little more detail on these transactions later in the call.", "The takeaway here is that the significant strength of our balance sheet will continue to provide us with opportunities to create value.", "It is nice to have a strong first quarter behind us as we look ahead to the rest of 2010. As I said earlier, it was a little better than we expected at the beginning of the year. These results along with the expected benefits are a buyback and refinancing activities led us to raise our 2010 adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $3.40 to $3.50. This would result in 11% to 15% growth over 2009.", "Despite the increasing foreign exchange headwinds, we are also raising the low-end of our revenue guidance to a new range of $10.65 to $10.80 billion based on our solid operating performance and the acquisitions we made so far this year. This would lead to 5% to 7% growth in revenues over 2009.", "So, to summarize, first, we\u2019re off to a good start to the year operationally. Second, we continue to put our strong balance sheet to work. We raised our annual guidance as a result of these two points. And as the year progresses, while the comps will become more difficult, I feel good about our outlook for 2010.", "With that, I\u2019d like to hand the call to our CFO, Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Pete Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we\u2019re pleased to report significant improvement in our earnings for the first quarter with 35% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to a record $0.84, compared to $0.62 last year. GAAP EPS in Q1 was $0.56 also up significantly from $0.35 in the prior year\u2019s quarter.", "Moving on to our topline performance, we reported a 19% increase in revenues year-over-year to a record $2.68 billion, organic revenue growth 13% in the quarter excluding favorable foreign currency translation of 3% and another 3% from acquisitions.", "We had strong growth across our portfolio in Q1 with instruments and equipment growing in the mid teens, consumables growth in the low double digits and services growing in the high single digits.", "I\u2019m very pleased with these results, although it\u2019s important to note that we had a very easy comparison with minus 7% organic decline in the 2009 quarter. We also had four more days in the quarter, compared to the last year as a result of our fiscal calendar, which primarily helped our consumables businesses. As a reminder, the fourth quarter will have four fewer days, so we\u2019ll lose the incremental calendar benefit at the end of the year.", "We continue to strengthen our backlog with bookings exceeding revenues in the quarter by 2%. By segment, Analytical Technologies Q1 revenues grew 18% on a reported basis and 10% organically. All of our key growth platforms contributed to these results including those primarily serving industrial markets. And as Marc mentioned, mass spec was particularly strong.", "On the negative side, our microbiology business grew slower than the segment average as it was affected by a very weak flu season. Some of our analytical instruments product lines that serve late cycle industrial markets are still down year-over-year, although we see signs that they\u2019re stabilizing.", "In the laboratory products and services segment, Q1 revenues grew 19% on a reported basis and 15% organically. During the quarter, we saw consistently strong growth across the segment in both laboratory equipment and consumables and our BioPharma services business returned to high single-digit growth.", "By geography, we saw double-digit organic revenue growth in North America and Asia Pacific driven by very strong growth in China and Japan. The rest of the world continued to grow faster than the company average though from a relatively small base. Europe returned to positive growth in the low single digits this quarter, compared to a mid single digit decline in the prior year.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, Q1 increased 34% year-over-year to $468 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 200 basis points from 15.5% in the year ago quarter.", "The year-over-year margin expansion resulted primarily from pull through at marginal rates on the organic volume growth along with a net impact of our prior year cost reductions actions, as well as our global sourcing and PPI efforts. Pricing also contributed positively to our margin expansion but somewhat less than in prior quarters.", "By segment, Analytical Technologies adjusted operating income increased by 34% year-over-year in Q1. And adjusted operating margin was 21%, up 250 basis points versus 18.5% last year.", "Laboratory products and services Q1 adjusted operating income also increased by 34% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 13.9%, up 160 basis points versus 12.3% in the 2009 quarter.", "Moving to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 42.4% in Q1, up 170 basis points from the year ago quarter. This was primarily a result of marginal pull-through on the strong organic revenue growth, as well as our global sourcing efforts and the cost reduction initiatives that we implemented in 2009.", "Adjusted SG&A was 22.5% of revenue in Q1 down 10 basis points from 22.6% in the year ago quarter with favorable volume leverage this quarter offsetting our continued investment in commercial expansion and slightly higher compensation expense -- stock compensation.", "R&D expense was 2.5% of revenue in Q1, down slightly from last year primarily as a result of significantly higher revenues this year diluting the percentage of spend. On a dollar basis, we increased our R&D spending even after adjusting for foreign exchange and acquisitions. So we continue to invest in technology development to expand our new product pipeline for future growth.", "Moving below the line, our Q1 adjusted net interest expense decreased $5 million year-over-year to $20 million, driven by lower interest expense as a result of the refinancing we completed last November.", "Other income was a loss of $3 million, down $6 million from last year, primarily as a result of currency transaction losses on foreign entity cash, compared with transaction gains in the 2009 quarter.", "As forecast, our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, up 1.5 points from the prior year\u2019s quarter, primarily as a result of higher income at marginal rates. And average diluted shares were 418 million in the quarter, down 7 million from last year, primarily as a result of the $500 million share buyback authorization we completed in the second quarter of last year.", "With regard to the balance sheet, our cash flow performance remains very strong. Quarter to date free cash flow from continuing ops was $293 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $50 million in the quarter. Free cash flow for the quarter was down slightly versus last year driven by investment in working capital to support significantly higher revenues.", "We ended the quarter with $1.44 billion in cash and investments, down $131 million from Q4, as a result of acquisitions and the settlement of convertible debt partially offset by our strong free cash flow.", "Our total debt was $2.07 billion, down $109 million from Q4, primarily as a result of convertible debt redemptions initiated by bond voters, which I\u2019ll talk more about later.", "With regard to working capital, we had good performance this quarter as we continue to make tangible progress in this area. Accounts receivable days outstanding were 50 days, down seven days from the prior year and inventory days of supply were 67 days, down 11 days from the prior year. Both metrics increased sequentially from our excellent performance in Q4 but this was expected given the seasonality of Q1 versus Q4 working capital balances.", "Before I move on to our 2010 guidance, I\u2019d like to provide a brief overview of our recent refinancing activities. Since November, we\u2019ve issued $1.5 billion of new debt to take advantage of the current favorable capital markets and to reduce our exposure to convertibles in higher cost fixed rate debt.", "In Q1, we used cash to settle $120 million of convertible debt plus the associated premium. And in Q2, we\u2019ll be using the proceeds of our $750 million April bond offering plus cash on the balance sheet to retire $500 million of 6% and 8% straight debt and another $218 million of converts plus premium.", "I\u2019d like to point out that there will be a few month lag between funding and resumption of some of the debt in Q2, which will cause some minor negative interest carry in the quarter.", "The result of these refinancing actions will be lower interest costs along with much better match between our fixed variable interest rate mix and our cash flow profile. We\u2019ll also have good accretion as a result of retiring $640 million of converts since Q4 and the associated share premium, which of course will become more accretive as our stock price increases. So overall, an excellent use of our balance sheet to generate shareholder value.", "Now, for our 2010 guidance, we\u2019re maintaining the high-end of our revenue guidance and raising the low end by $50 million from our previous range of $10.60 to $10.80 billion to a new range of $10.65 to $10.80 billion. This range represents growth of 5% to 7%, compared to our 2009 revenues of $10.11 billion.", "Our guidance includes a little more than 2% growth from past acquisitions and divestitures and assumes no future acquisitions or divestitures. It also assumes current foreign exchange rates, which would have a slight unfavorable impact of a little less than 0.5% on our revenue growth. Consistent with past practice, we haven\u2019t attempted to forecast future foreign exchange rates.", "Even though we\u2019re maintaining the high-end of our revenue guidance, I\u2019d like to point out a number of changes from our previous guidance. Specifically, we increased our organic revenue growth by about 1% from a range of 2% to 4% to a range of 3% to 5%, as a result of increased confidence in our outlook after delivering strong Q1 results.", "And we added about 0.5% as a result of the acquisitions we closed since we issued our previous guidance. These two factors were offset entirely by less favorable foreign exchange translation of over 1.5% as a result of a stronger dollar.", "In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising both the low and high-end of our previous guidance resulting in an $0.08 increase in the midpoint and a $0.05 narrower range. Specifically, we\u2019re increasing our previous range of $3.30 to $3.45 to a new range of $3.40 to $3.50, resulting, which represents 11% to 15% growth compared to our 2009 adjusted EPS of $3.05.", "The primary drivers for increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance are the expected decrease from the debt refinancing and $750 million share buyback that our board authorized last week. Along with slightly improved operating performance based on our strong Q1 results.", "We\u2019re on track to complete the refinancing activity as announced and for modeling purposes our guidance assumption is that we will complete the share buyback ratably over the next 12 months.", "To wrap up, it was an excellent quarter and we\u2019re pleased to see continued positive momentum across the company.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Good morning. And congratulations on a record quarter.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ross.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "So, Marc, the market commentary was very helpful, as we look at sort of Q1 results for a lot of your customers, the numbers coming in are considerably above what the Street was looking for. It feels like momentum is building in the recovery and we\u2019re still not sort of inventory rebuild and kind of even some potential for some capacity build-out. As we sort of think about the economy maybe being a bit stronger than we had thought a few months back.", "Can you point to specific businesses where today maybe the order commentary is starting to get more positive but we haven\u2019t seen the turn but you\u2019re expecting hopefully at some point in the next six to 12 months, we\u2019re going to get a bit more leverage and pull-through through the revenue line?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So, a few things. I think when you look at the first quarter, as we said, it came in a little better than we expected. And I think when you put your original guidance out there especially coming from such a bad and tough year in 2009 for the global economy, just the fact that you get through a good quarter is a good thing. I mean, there\u2019s less uncertainty for the rest of the year now. So in and of itself, that\u2019s helpful.", "When you look at the various parts of the business, really, the longer, cycle decisions on the industrial side is what still six to 12 months out. So, it\u2019s, when people are actually having to build factories or expand capacity, that\u2019s still a way out, what we\u2019re seeing is clearly capacity utilization is increasing.", "So spare part demands up, the short cycle type instruments which are not massive decisions, things break, things need to be replaced, they\u2019re being bought, hand-helds, really very strong momentum.", "When you\u2019re making the decision I\u2019m going to expand a new line, build a new factory. We\u2019re having some inquiries at this point in time, but that means it\u2019s still several quarters away. Those aren\u2019t orders yet. Those are long lead time items. So that\u2019s really the thing that is out in the future.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And that\u2019s more your process instrumentation type businesses?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. It\u2019s the industrial part of the analytical instruments business. So, it is everything from bulk element to where you\u2019re doing quality control to the process instruments online instrumentation.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "And one quick one for Pete. We look at the growth in OpEx and the quarter. I mean, obviously, the topline was phenomenal. But as we sort of look particularly on the SG&A line, how could we sort of tease out what we saw this quarter in growth there.", "Was some of that maybe from the day\u2019s impact? Was that more in line with what we\u2019ll see organically versus the topline through the rest of the year? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense for the OpEx side. How much of the selling expense et cetera was impacted by days versus actual increased spend and when will we start to see the other cost saves from last year continue to flow through?", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah. There are a couple of things going on there. One, as you said, we had four more days in the quarter. So, we picked up four more days of fixed costs. So, the 13% organic growth came with four extra days of expenses whereas in a normal quarter you wouldn\u2019t have that.", "In terms of the $25 million of cost reduction actions that we\u2019re getting in terms of carryover, we got about actually half of that in Q1 in terms of savings and we\u2019ll get the other half spread out over the rest of the year.", "And then as we go through the year, we will ramp-up our investments in our commercial teams in the areas like Asia, which is -- what was our original plan. So you\u2019ll see a ramp-up in the spend, but of course, we\u2019re expecting a ramp-up in the dollars of revenue as well.", "Ross Muken \u2013 Deutsche Bank", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Pete Wilver", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question from Jon Groberg from Macquarie Capital. Please proceed.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Yeah. Thanks a million for taking the call and congratulations on a great quarter. So can you maybe, Pete or Marc, you mentioned that pricing was less than maybe you have seen in previous quarters. Can you maybe dive into a bit more detail in terms of the puts and takes in terms of where pricing was stronger and maybe where it was not as strong?", "Pete Wilver", "Sure. You know, we still did get price, something a little bit more than 1%. And right now, we\u2019re seeing it much easier to get price into consumables area than it is in the instruments and equipment.", "And a recovery period, there\u2019s just a little bit more competition out there as all of the suppliers are trying to get the growth back. So, we\u2019re seeing just a little bit more competitive environment on the equipment and instrumentation right now than we\u2019ve seen in the past.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then one follow-up. You mentioned a lot of the, some of the things to take into consideration of such as extra days. Can you talk about maybe some of the other things like where you stand, for example on Biosite revenues, if that\u2019s, if you\u2019re losing those faster than you thought or if it is at about the rate you thought.", "And also, there was a snowstorm in the Northeast, one of your big competitors mentioned impacting business maybe whether or not there was an impact to you guys in the quarter?", "Pete Wilver", "Sure. On Biosite, we\u2019re pretty much on track with what we were expecting on Biosite both in the quarter and what we\u2019re expecting for the full year. So, that headwind net of the alternative supplier that we pick up, that\u2019s about the same assumption.", "Flu actually got a little bit worse. We were expecting a $30 million hit year-over-year, but the Q1 flu season was extremely weak. So that probably added another $5 to $10 million to the headwind there.", "And then, as far as the snowstorm, that really is a minor impact for us. It\u2019s not something that came up in any of our business reviews as a significant number.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "Pete Wilver", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please proceed.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking the questions. First question on U.S. stimulus, you guys sounded positive relative to what we\u2019ve heard from some of the other companies in the group.", "Do you think you\u2019re doing better from a competitive standpoint in capturing stimulus dollars and presumably instruments are doing a little bit better than consumables? Are consumables spending starting to pick up a little bit when it comes to stimulus?", "Marc Casper", "So, Doug, we\u2019re pleased with the progress that we\u2019ve made on stimulus. As you recall, it\u2019s well over a year ago, we forecasted $100 to $200 million of revenue. That we would get from stimulus. We got $50 million last year. So, we said, we\u2019d do $50 to $150 million this year. We did $60 million in the quarter. And when you look at the bookings for future quarters, we\u2019re going to be solidly in that range that we said.", "So, we feel good about how stimulus is flowing. Japan has been very impressive. We\u2019re starting to see funds flow in the U.S. Obviously our instrument technologies are really being extremely well embraced by our academic and government customers. So, we feel good about it.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Okay. Great. And one follow-up or I guess a second question, any chance you could just provide a little bit more color on the rationale to the Lilly deal and maybe talk about the margin profile of the agreement. It sounds like this was mostly opportunistic rather than defensive. Is this --was this the case and should we envision other deals like this down the road?", "Marc Casper", "We have a really attractive BioPharma services business. It\u2019s one of our six core platforms in the company. We do a lot of partnering with our customers to really leverage our scale and expertise and our global footprint.", "So, many, if not all of the major pharmaceutical and biotech companies work with us in the clinical trials process and we have crafted a number of partnership proposals over the years to leverage that.", "Over the years, we\u2019ve bought facilities and things of that sort. We\u2019ve helped them consolidate facilities and in this one, it\u2019s just a nice example of a company like Lilly, which is a world-class company going through a change process where they were comfortable with us running their facility in their campus and leveraging our expertise.", "And so, it\u2019s not opportunistic, its very core to how we operate. We have the dialogue all the time with our big customers. And we think this is a really nice win for the company and I think it continues to allow us to demonstrate our market leadership in that part of our business.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Marc Casper", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Yeah. Hi, everybody. Good morning.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Marshall.", "Pete Wilver", "Good morning, Marshall.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "So, first question was just on guidance and maybe what\u2019s baked into your expectations over the balance of the year. If you could just talk through some of the major end markets, industrials, BioPharma, top 20, academic, government, are you expecting adjusted of course for the day, but sort of current levels of spending or does this contemplate continued improvement from here?", "Marc Casper", "We\u2019re assuming that it\u2019s pretty much at the current slowly recovering economy. So, the conditions we saw in the first quarter would continue throughout the balance of the year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it from a guidance perspective. And by the market segments, that\u2019s pretty consistent across that group.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks. Then Pete, just a question on kind of understanding gross margins in the quarter. How big was the FX benefit and maybe, the benefits of absorption and higher sales levels and then sort of the underlying productivity improvements and should we think you guys see some gross margin pressure over the next couple quarters, from volume or they\u2019re, sort of more offset as we go through the year?", "Pete Wilver", "In terms of FX, it really doesn\u2019t change the rate. We\u2019re pretty naturally hedged there, so that pretty much FX revenues fall through to the bottom line at our averages. So, that\u2019s not a factor.", "The way to think about it is that productivity and inflation price and the investments that we\u2019re making kind of net out to zero and its all volume pull-through. Which sort of explains why, when you look into the second, third and fourth quarter, obviously the volume increase year-over-year is lower, so we\u2019re expecting lower margin expansion overall, for the rest of the year.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from First Analysis. Please proceed.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "Thank you. Two questions. One, can you quantify the impact of the additional days in the quarter?", "Pete Wilver", "Well, as you know, it\u2019s very difficult to come up with a precise answer. So, I can give you a range. It is probably about a positive 4% to 5% benefit.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "Okay.", "Pete Wilver", "\u2026 in the quarter, which of course, we\u2019ll lose 4% to 5% in Q4 because of that.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "Okay. Thank you. And then Pete, how did your gross margin increase so much sequentially versus the fourth quarter on a lower level of revenue?", "Pete Wilver", "To be honest, I haven\u2019t done the sequential bridge. Yeah, I haven\u2019t done the sequential bridge. I think, we probably had a few more of the kind of year-end cleanup items in Q4 than we had in Q1. But other than that, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything materially different.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Thomas Weisel Partners. Please proceed.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Peter.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Good morning, Marc. I wonder if you could talk through the growth in the North American market, what was the major driver there?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. In North America, it was really nice to see customers clearly spending again, very, very strong performance in life sciences mass spec, which we\u2019re very pleased with how the year started there.", "We obviously had good showing at Pitcairn and that\u2019s reflected in good activity across our instrument businesses more broadly in North America. Lab equipment was very strong, across the board, but North America, nice to see, the lab equipment business picking up.", "And then consumables especially on to the research laboratory, again a really strong start to the year. So very broad-based improvement in North America. Obviously, we had a tough first quarter last year so the comparison is easier, but nonetheless a good start to the year.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Thank you. And then just one for Peter on bookings. Assume they\u2019re ahead of revenue growth. What was it like in the book average and what was ahead of the book average sounded like academia was ahead?", "Pete Wilver", "Honestly, we don\u2019t track bookings at that level. I can tell you that bookings were ahead of revenue as I said, by 2%. The Analytical Technologies segment was up a little more than the average and laboratory products and services was up a little bit less than the average. So that\u2019s about the level of detail I\u2019ve on that.", "Peter Lawson - Thomas Weisel Partners", "Okay. Thank you so much.", "Pete Wilver", "Sure.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, J.P. Morgan. Please proceed.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Tycho.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Good morning. And maybe starting off with a question on guidance. I know, you bumped up organic revenue growth, you talked a minute ago about your kind of thoughts in the end markets.", "Can you talk at all as to whether factored into this is return on some of the higher R&D investment? I mean to what extent do you expect that to start to kick in this year?", "Marc Casper", "Tycho, I would say that we wouldn\u2019t anticipate any return on the increase because those are longer term projects and we had articulated that in our original guidance. That\u2019s really a late \u201811, 2012 timeframe.", "We are obviously seeing the benefit of products that we have launched in 2009, and we\u2019ll launch in 2010 this year. But it wouldn\u2019t be attributable to the particular increase and spend. That\u2019s a little bit longer term return.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then your comments a minute ago on stimulus and you mentioned Japan. Was there an impact here from the supplemental budget, I know, some of the other companies have called that out as a driver in the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. I mean, that\u2019s part of what was going on. It was a real desire by Japanese customers to get these products installed and ready to about by end of \u2013 by March 31st. So, really a very dynamic market for us in the first quarter.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. And then just one last quick one on, you had some questions a minute ago on the Lilly agreement. But can you talk more generally as you go and work with your customers, are you getting more interest in longer term agreements, more strategic. We hear this all the time in the CRO world about agreements with pharma getting more broad and strategic. Can you talk more about what your customers are asking for?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. I mean, our bigger customers are clearly asking for assistance with the challenges that they are facing. And that means they\u2019re looking for how do you get more productivity out of the R&D pipeline at the pharma companies and there\u2019s no short-term fix to that.", "So they are typically coming to a company like Thermo Fisher with a value proposition saying, how you\u2019re going to help us be more productive on the scientific side. And that\u2019s longer agreements, working with us much more closely in a deeper fashion. The Lilly example is one but, many of the other large pharmaceutical companies are working with us with our channels business, with technology access, broadly across the company to help them meet their challenges.", "Tycho Peterson - J.P. Morgan", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc Casper", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird. Please proceed.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Quintin.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Hi. Good morning. Congratulations on a nice start. Hey, a lot of my questions have been answered. Marc, you\u2019ve continued to make really nice tuck-in acquisitions. Could you kind of refresh us on your view, on the M&A landscape right now and especially on some of the smaller acquisitions? Is the fact that you\u2019ve got such a large sales channel attractive for maybe some of the sellers to try to join your organization?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. When you look at and I\u2019ll give a broad answer to this question. You look at the M&A landscape, clearly, as I\u2019ve said in the past, because 2009 was a relatively quiet period of time especially the first half. There\u2019s been more activity and more companies that have, come up for sale. And we\u2019ve looked at many and picked the ones that we feel are passionate about in terms of improving our offering to our customers and where we think we can create unique value.", "In this particular year, we are very excited about building out our hand-held offering with Ahura, continuing to strengthen our Bioscience reagents with Finnzymes. And then Proxeon, obviously we have a really strong position in proteomics, whether it\u2019s a reagent business or incredible mass spec portfolio. But we like their technology and we brought that part of the business.", "When we evaluate acquisitions, we\u2019re looking at how do you generate returns. And one of the things we look at is what\u2019s the value we bring because we\u2019ve an incredible reach to customers globally, we\u2019ve a high degree of confidence that we can drive revenue synergies. We don\u2019t pay for revenue synergies per se, I think, that\u2019s something that\u2019s upside for our shareholders.", "But when we look at a lot of the deals that we did, we plug them into our channels and we\u2019re focused on accelerating organic growth and that sort of incremental value that we\u2019re able to create for our shareholders.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird", "Thank you very much.", "Marc Casper", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies. Please proceed.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Jon.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies", "Hi. Thanks a lot. Marc, you mentioned double-digit growth in the top 20, and could you tease out the consumables versus capital equipment trend within that? I guess what I\u2019m getting at is does the merger disruption we see more impact the instrumentation or the consumables in your view?", "Marc Casper", "You know, when you look at the top 20, I think the way you think about it is more customer specific than product specific. And depending on where integrations are, customers are different phases of decision making.", "And I think you can say for the top 20 is very much how we characterize what\u2019s going on in the BioPharma markets more generally, which is capital is flowing but certainly more constrained. Consumables and meaning that people are doing their daily work is stronger. I mean, that\u2019s just the nature of where that customer set is right now.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies", "Okay. Thanks a lot. One quick follow-up for Pete. Can you quantify the benefit of the sourcing in PPI to the margins in the quarter?", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah. The total productivity net of investments is a little over 1% in terms of margin expansion. But, as I said, that\u2019s offset by the inflation. So, it sort of nets to zero.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies", "So, there was 1% or so core inflation in that?", "Pete Wilver", "It\u2019s actually a little bit higher than that, probably closer to 1.5%. Because and then we picked up close to a half a percent in terms of price. That\u2019s at the EBITDA level not at the gross margin level.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Rob Hawkins from Stifel Nicolaus. Please proceed.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thanks. Can you expand a little bit on the German global food testing lab and whether you guys envision expanding that to other regions of the world or is this going to be the one big one for you?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. So we have a number of applications, laboratories around the world. And I was in Germany a couple of weeks ago to visit the facility. Effectually, what we\u2019re doing here is a lot of the regulators in Brussels, it\u2019s the logical place for us to put it given our critical mass in Germany.", "We have a dedicated lab to work on food safety and really focus on chemical contamination. What we learned and we\u2019ve got a lot of business out of the melamine scare and crisis over a year plus ago, is that, there was in general a lag in being able to respond to that crisis across the industry and the regulators, we followed up with them after the crisis and they basically said, we have to be more proactive, they do. and the more we can help them, the better off we are.", "So we set this lab up. We had an interesting opening where we had a number of customers come in, understand our capabilities, interact with our scientists. And they\u2019re aware if there is ever a problem we\u2019ll be right there partnering with them to get the methodologies put in place. And be able to reduce the time to respond to contain any potential crisis.", "So I think one global center is the right approach here because effectively the food chain is pretty global and customers are going to be comfortable with the Dreieich as a logical location for that.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "No. Competitive needs to be in South America, Asia, closer to where the stuff is manufactured, it doesn\u2019t matter?", "Marc Casper", "I think the reality is we have all of our commercial application teams in those markets. And it\u2019s more, you\u2019re getting samples, basically, to a single laboratory. So, I think this is at least how we\u2019re thinking about Europe and overtime, if we need to expand elsewhere, we certainly can. We have the global footprint to do that.", "Rob Hawkins - Stifel Nicolaus", "Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, UBS. Please proceed.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Hi. Good morning.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "So, one quick question and one kind of philosophical. So, what, Pete, are you using for kind of like your share -- your outstanding share count target for the end of the year?", "Pete Wilver", "It\u2019s around 415 million.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Okay. Thank you. And I guess, Marc, you raise your (inaudible) growth by 5-point. The industrials are still lagging. I guess, what do you need, what do you need to really see, I think, to give you comfort, you\u2019ll consistently get to more of back to kind of like sustainable mid to single-digit range of that. Is it really just the industrial that is kind of missing or there are some other parts still out there in the economy that you need to see come back in?", "Marc Casper", "You know, Derik, thanks for this very important question. So a couple of different points. We started the year, at one level of expectation getting the quarter behind us, we raised our organic growth outlook by a point of 3 to 5.", "You might recall there are a couple of company specific things that we face this year which is really around Biosite and flu comparisons, which is about a point. So, that 3 to 5, you can think about it. And we don\u2019t do a lot of these mental reconciliations. But it\u2019s really 4 to 6 because of the company specific decision to move away from Biosite.", "So, in our view is, this is going to be a mid single-digit year. The things that overtime, will get incrementally more positive is going to be industrial, right? It\u2019s probably late this year, early next year. It\u2019s several quarters away. But that\u2019s a positive. But we already feel like we\u2019re going to be there this year in terms of that mid single-digit organic growth.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Great. Thanks, Marc. That\u2019s very helpful.", "Marc Casper", "You\u2019re welcome.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Apicerno. Please proceed.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Marc, if you want to make a few comments?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So with a record first quarter, it\u2019s clear that we\u2019ve emerged from the recession a stronger industry leader. We\u2019re pleased to report another quarter of growth and excited about the many opportunities we have to build on that momentum. I look forward to reporting on our progress throughout the year. Thanks for joining us on the call. And for your continued support of Thermo Fisher.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Please be aware that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the headings Webcasts and Presentations, until August 27, 2010. A copy of the press release of the second quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our review of the second quarter. The last time I spoke to most of you was at our Analyst Meeting back in May. If you recall, our theme for the meeting was leveraging our leadership to drive earnings growth. It was a great opportunity to share with you how we are driving a combination of growth investment and operating performance to achieve our earnings goals. I'm pleased to tell you that we're right on track with our strategy and that we delivered record EPS performance again in Q2 on solid top line results. I'm especially pleased with our performance because the business environment obviously still has its challenges. However, we have built a company that is the recognized industry leader. As such, we have three key strengths that gives us a market advantage and drive our performance.", "These strengths are: our unique depth of capabilities; second, our proven track record of operating performance; and third, our commitment to continued investment for growth, a combination of developing new technologies and making complementary acquisitions. We discussed this back in May in some detail. I will highlight some recent examples today that show you how these strengths not only contributed to our strong results for the quarter but position us for a great future.", "First, I will run through our Q2 financial highlights. We reported second quarter revenues of $2.65 billion, 7% higher than 2009. This translated to 5% organic growth, which was in line with our expectation for the quarter. Our revenue growth reflected strong performance across our Laboratory Equipment, Consumables, Clinical Diagnostics and Biosciences businesses. We also saw strength in our Analytical Instrument businesses that serve applied markets, such as food safety testing and environmental monitoring. We are especially pleased with our organic growth results, given the headwinds of a weak flu season and the Biosite contract transition, which, together, lowered our organic growth by over a percentage point in the quarter.", "We delivered solid adjusted operating margin expansion in Q2, achieving 17.6% versus 16.8% in the year-ago quarter. Through proven operating discipline, we are fully leveraging our top line revenue growth for pull-through to the bottom line and benefiting from our ongoing cost-saving activities, including practical process improvement, PPI lean and global sourcing.", "Last, we're pleased to report that adjusted EPS was a second quarter record at $0.84, 14% higher than 2009. We continue to build on our strong track record of delivering double-digit EPS growth.", "So I'm proud of how our teams executed operationally and their efforts resulted in a strong quarter. This, combined with our excellent performance in Q1, added up to a great first half of the year for Thermo Fisher. ", "I'll spend a couple minutes now framing what we're seeing in our key end markets at this point in the year. Interestingly, despite everything we hear about in the news, as a company, we haven't seen any dramatic changes since Q1. ", "In biopharma markets, capital spending is still under pressure. Our view is that the pharma market got tougher as these customers continue to evaluate their cost structures. I'm sure you've heard about the recent site consolidations in a number of big pharma companies, and we don't see this abating in Q3. While pharma is weak, we continue to see strength in biotech, as evidenced by strong performance in our Biosciences business in Q2.", "Turning to academic and government markets. We benefited modestly from stimulus programs, with some additional funding being released in the U.S. This complements the strong revenue we recorded in Q1 tied to stimulus programs in Japan. We expect to see some continuation of stimulus-related orders in revenue from U.S. programs in the second half.", "Looking at healthcare. As you see from other companies, demand in this market is generally soft. This is driven by fewer doctor and hospital visits along with the very weak flu season. From a Thermo Fisher perspective, on the other hand, our Clinical Diagnostics business, in particular, such as drugs of abuse tests and specialty assays, showed strong growth in the quarter. ", "Finally, I'll cover industrial markets. While we had an easy comparison with the 2009 quarter, we are definitely seeing some improvement in the industrial economy across the globe. For example, our Portable Analyzers business, which serves a broad sector of the industrial market, showed very strong growth in the quarter.", "Let me now turn to some business highlights from Q2. At the beginning of my comments, I referred to our depth of capabilities and commitment to growth investment as key differentiators for us in the marketplace. I'll give you a few examples of how this positions us to meet the changing needs of our customers.", "First, we were the headliner again this year at ASMS, the leading mass spectrometry conference. One highlight was our new suite of informatics products. These software advancements, such as Proteome Discoverer, virtually reinvent mass spec-based workflows for life sciences, fully leveraging the power of our leading Thermo Scientific technologies including the Orbitrap.", "For more routine applications, such as water or pesticide analysis, our new triple quad system, the TSQ Quantum XLS, significantly raised the bar. It offers the flexibility, speed and sensitivity our customers need to improve productivities in their laboratories.", "In the clinical research and specialty diagnostics markets, we are highlighting our capabilities at the AACC Expo, which is happening as we speak out in Anaheim. Among several launches at this show is our new workflow for the analysis of immunosuppressant drugs. This comprehensive solution offers clinical researchers a workflow that is seamless and easy-to-use. It leverages technologies across several of our businesses including Specialty Diagnostics, Analytical Instruments and Laboratory Consumables.", "Also on display at AACC are biomarker market tests from our Bronze business, which we acquired last fall. This is the first time we showcased these product at a major trade show under the Thermo Scientific brand. We are extremely pleased with the performance of this business, which has continued to deliver strong double-digit growth.", "Shifting gears a bit. The devastating news about the crisis in the Gulf of Mexico has been front-and-center in the media. But I'm pleased to report that we're playing a positive role here. During the quarter, we developed new analytical screening methods to rapidly detect oil contamination in seafood. You may recall that we announced the opening of our new Food Safety Response Center back in early April. Well, our timing couldn't have been better. We secured samples from the Gulf and our scientists at the center worked around-the-clock to develop step-by-step testing procedures that can be implemented at food safety and environmental laboratories. These new methods, which are based on our instruments, equipment and consumables, are available to any government agency, company or laboratory around the world.", "I'd also like to mention some of our notable accomplishments in China as well, which, as you know, is a key growth a geography for us. We won a multimillion dollar project from China's major oil and coal company to design, construct and equip their new R&D center, which is being built from the ground up. The center will focus on developing various clean coal technologies. We also continue to see strong demand for our environmental instruments across China, and in fact, our air and radiation monitors are being used at the World Expo currently being held in Shanghai.", "In addition to these business highlights, let me cover our recent capital deployment activities and what we've done there to create shareholder value. In the first half of the year, we deployed approximately $0.75 billion of our capital. Our focus during the time has been on both acquisitions and stock buybacks. ", "First an acquisition update. In Q2, we completed the acquisition of Proxeon, and just after quarter end, we closed on the acquisition of Fermentas. Proxeon, as we mentioned last quarter, is a supplier of products that creates simplified workflows for proteomics applications. These technologies complement our leading ion trap and hybrid systems by adding capabilities for nanoflow liquid chromatography.", "Fermentas, which we closed just a couple weeks ago, is a global provider of molecular and cellular biology tools for genomics research. Its broad product line includes reagents, enzymes and other life science research and diagnostic tools. Fermentas also offers key technologies for PCR-based testing. This, along with our Finnzymes acquisition in Q1, significantly strengthens our offering for high-growth PCR market applications.", "Also of note, the integration of Ahura Scientific, which we acquired in Q1, is going very well. To remind you, Ahura Scientific is the leading provider of portable spectroscopy analyzers. With these products, we now have an impressive lineup of portable analyzers that bring advanced technologies to our customers who need to perform rapid precise analysis in the field.", "Another way we have deployed capital is through stock buybacks. We spent $187 million in Q2 under our $750 million repurchase program, which was authorized in April. Pete will cover this in more detail in his remarks.", "Moving on to our guidance. We're pleased with our strong performance in the first half, which puts us solidly on track to meet our goals for the full year. We remain confident in our outlook for earnings growth in 2010 and are, therefore, maintaining our adjusted EPS guidance of $3.40 and $3.50 per share. This would lead to 11% to 15% growth over 2009.", "On the top line, we're adjusting our guidance to reflect less favorable foreign exchange rates and the addition of our recent acquisitions. We now expect to generate from $10.60 billion to $10.75 billion in revenues in 2010, which would result in 5% to 6% growth year-to-year.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me summarize our key takeaways for Q2. We had another strong quarter delivering solid performance at the top line and record EPS results. These results led to a great first half of the year and position us well to achieve our objectives for 2010. While we will face FX headwinds and tougher comparisons in the third and fourth quarters, we are confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals for the second half of the year. ", "With that, I'd like to turn the call to our CFO, Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we delivered another quarter of strong operating performance, with 14% growth in our adjusted earnings per share to a second quarter record of $0.84 compared to $0.74 last year. Our results were even stronger if you take into account weakening foreign exchange rates, which, as I mentioned in our May Analyst Meeting, created $0.01 per share headwind compared to our guidance assumptions at the beginning of the quarter.", "GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.57, up from $0.49 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of our improved operating performance. ", "Moving on to our top line performance. Reported revenue in Q2 increased 7% year-over-year to $2.65 billion. Organic revenue growth was 5% in the quarter excluding foreign currency translation of negative 1% and a 3% benefit from acquisitions net of divestitures.", "As Marc said, flu and the Biosite transition negatively affected organic growth by over a percentage point in the quarter.", "Our results in Q2 continued our trend of solid growth across our portfolio, with Instruments and Equipment and Consumables both growing in the mid-single digits and Services growing in the low-single digits.", "We also continued to strengthen our backlog with bookings exceeding revenues in the quarter by 2%. In the Analytical Technology segment, Q2 revenues grew 10% on a reported basis and 5% organically. In the quarter, we saw especially strong growth in our Mass Spec, Clinical Diagnostics and Biosciences businesses. Also, a number of our Instruments businesses serving industrial markets continued to strengthen and contributed nicely to growth.", "On the other hand, growth in our Microbiology business was negatively affected by a tough year-over-year comparison with high H1N1 flu sales in the prior year and overall weakness in the healthcare markets, as Marc mentioned.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q2 revenues grew 5% on both the reported and organic basis. During the quarter, we saw strong growth in Laboratory Equipment and Consumables, partially offset by the same flu headwinds and soft healthcare market that are affecting our Microbiology business as well as the Biosite contract transition that we announced previously.", "Looking at organic growth by geography. North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific all grew in the mid-single digits in Q2 this year versus mid-single-digit declines in each region last year. Rest of the world grew slower than the company average against a tougher comparison of high-single-digit growth in the prior year.", "Q2 adjusted operating income increased 11% year-over-year to $466 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.6%, up about 75 basis points from 16.8% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion resulted primarily from strong pull-through on the organic volume growth and the benefits of global sourcing and practical process improvements. This was partially offset by strategic investments in R&D and commercial resources to drive future growth.", "By segment, Analytical Technologies' Q2 adjusted operating income increased by 13% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 20.6%, up about 55 basis points versus 20.1% last year.", "Q2 adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services increased by 10% year-over-year, and adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, up about 60 basis points versus 13.6% in the 2009 quarter.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 42.3% in Q2, up about 125 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven primarily by strong pull-through on organic revenue growth and our global sourcing efforts, along with PPI and the cost-reduction initiatives that we implemented in 2009.", "Adjusted SG&A was 22.0% of revenue in Q2, up about 10 basis points from 21.9% in the year-ago quarter, reflecting our continued investment in commercial expansion and slightly higher stock compensation expense. ", "R&D expense was 2.7% of revenue in Q2, up $12 million or about 30 basis points from last year, reflecting our increased investment in technology development to expand our new product pipeline for future growth.", "Moving below the line. Our Q2 adjusted net interest expense decreased $4 million year-over-year to $21 million, driven by lower interest expense as a result of our debt refinancing initiatives, partially offset by lower interest income due to lower interest rates earned on our cash balances. ", "Other income was a gain of $0.2 million, up $1.3 million from last year, primarily as a result of currency transaction gains of foreign entity cash this year compared with transaction losses in the 2009 quarter.", "Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.5%, flat with Q1 and up 1\u00bd points from Q2 2009, primarily as a result of higher income at marginal rates. ", "As Marc mentioned, during the quarter, we used $187.5 million of our current $750 million stock buyback authorization to purchase 3.7 million shares. Average diluted shares were 416 million in the quarter, down 8 million from last year, reflecting the benefit of our share buyback programs in 2009 and 2010, as well as the redemption of a significant portion of our convertible debt.", "I'm pleased to report that we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and that our cash flow performance remains solid considering the working capital investment required to support our top line growth. Year-to-date free cash flow from continuing ops was $520 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $107 million. ", "We ended the quarter with $1.32 billion in cash and investments, down $123 million from Q1, as free cash flow in the quarter was more than offset by cash used to repurchase our shares, pay down debt and make complementary acquisitions.", "Our total debt was $2.13 billion, up $62 million from Q1 as a result of our Q2 debt refinancing.", "With regard to working capital, we continued to have good performance this quarter. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 50 days, down three days from the prior year, and inventory days of supply were 68 days, down five days from the prior year.", "Moving on to our 2010 guidance. As you saw in the press release and heard from Marc, we are maintaining our previous adjusted EPS guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50. This represents 11% to 15% growth compared to our 2009 adjusted EPS of $3.05. We're also confident in our previous outlook for 2010 organic revenue growth of 3% to 5% as a result of our solid first half results and our current outlook for the second half.", "As I mentioned at our May Analyst Meeting, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past several months against many of our key foreign currencies has created about 1% headwind in terms of our reported revenue growth for the year. And this is being partially offset by our recent acquisitions, which will contribute about \u00bd% to our full year reported growth. ", "As a result of these factors, we are adjusting our revenue guidance from our previous range of $10.65 to $10.80 billion to a new range of $10.60 billion to $10.75 billion. This revised range represents growth of 5% to 6% compared to our 2009 revenues of $10.11 billion.", "As usual, our guidance does not include any significant assumptions with regard to future uses of capital, other than our previously announced $750 million share buyback authorization, which we expect to continue to utilize over the remaining nine months of the authorization. ", "In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the rest of 2010 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets for the remainder of the year.", "To reiterate some specifics about our second half outlook, as we stated in our call last quarter, our growth in margin comparisons get much tougher in the second half, and in Q4, we'll lose the four calendar days that we picked up in Q1. We also faced significant headwinds in the second half, with the termination of the Biosite contract as of July 1 and a very strong flu season last year versus our outlook for a normal flu season this year. Both of these items will impact Q3 comparisons more heavily than Q4.", "So in summary, we delivered another quarter of solid operating performance and strong financial results. With a great first half behind us, we're well positioned to achieve our 2010 financial goals. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "I just wasn't clear about your comments on the healthcare environment. I know Thermo is a little bit more diversified relative to some of the other tools players. So did you see an organic growth headwind from volumes in the quarter similar to a lot of other healthcare companies? And can you quantify that for us?", "Marc Casper", "Sure, Marshall. Let me give you a context of what's going in healthcare. We clearly, from a market perspective, which we serve, represents about a quarter of our revenue. The U.S. portion, clearly, saw headwinds in the market. As you read in the papers, as you see from other companies, I'm sure healthcare companies, it appears that doctor visits, hospital visits are down, and we see that in some of our Consumables businesses. When you look at Thermo Fisher specific, you have at the beginning of the Biosite transition, which puts a little bit more headwind on us, but we also had very, very strong positive performance, again company-specific, in our Clinical Diagnostics business, where drugs-of-abuse, specialty assay, as I said, extraordinarily strong growth in the quarter. So I think we're actually executing well, but the market conditions was clearly tougher.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then second one from me is just on Europe. I know you had touched on this lately, but there's been mixed signals sort of across the board and maybe just give us your thoughts on, specifically, what you're seeing there, both on the Consumables side and Instruments side and maybe comment on some of the different end markets in Europe and what your thought is in the quarter and what you're thinking for the rest of the year.", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of Europe, the performance regionally didn't vary a lot around the globe in the quarter. Obviously, we all read the headlines about Europe, but we're not actually seeing that in our business performance. So the business performed well in Europe. We saw strength across our Specialty Diagnostic businesses, both Anatomical Pathology Clinical Diagnostics did well. Our Industrial businesses did well in Europe. So while we read things, when you look to the Thermo Fisher specific, actions, we haven't seen really a change in trajectory in Europe at the end of the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So a lot of moving parts in terms of your business, and I just want to sort of follow up with what Marshall was keying in on. And so relative to coming into the year, as we look to the various end markets or the geographies, I mean, I know organic growth guidance hasn't changed meaningfully. But I think the end markets, we've seen some trends, whether it's in biopharma in terms of, you cited the site consolidations or in the healthcare market or in the industrial market that have either improved or deteriorated. As you look across the base piece of business, is there anything you're seeing trend-wise that was a bit of a surprise to you versus the beginning of the year? And then relative to that, as we think about kind of the organic growth guidance for the back half of the year, does it sort of assume most of the things that we see today kind of stay as is, e.g. no sort of industrial pickup and kind of the weak hospital volumes kind of continuing into the back half?", "Marc Casper", "So a few thoughts, Ross. One is I think one of the things that our investors appreciate is that the company is very predictable and has good visibility into the end markets. So if I think about our organic growth outlook that we've had for the year, what we said at the beginning of the year, what we said at the end of the first quarter and what we say today is we still feel good about the organic growth outlook for the full year. So I think that's a positive. We serve four key end markets and I think it's important to realize that there haven't been dramatic changes, but I think it's always helpful to say were the subtleties are. So industrial's getting a little bit better. Healthcare got slightly weaker. Pharma got slightly weaker. Biotech got slightly stronger, but these are all very, very subtle changes. When you look to the second half of the year, what we're assuming is exactly what we assume with our guidance, which is a slowly recovering economy, which we're seeing the signs of in our performance, and not dramatic changes off of that. There are upsides to it, which is a strengthening economy, more stimulus funds would be upsides. A double-dip recession would be downside. But right now, we're not seeing really big deviations from our original guidance.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "And do you feel like, Marc, that as we sort of see this gradual recovery and we get to a more normalized environment, that the way the business is performing versus what you see in the market from your peers, kind of affirms sort of the strategy originally behind the merger and that you're kind of able to gain share, able to leverage the size and scale and then able to inevitably deploy the cash flow on nice acquisitions like Fermentas?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, I feel great about our strategy and our execution. If I think about where we are from building the company, we have clear advantages with our depth of capabilities; we gaining share with our large customers; we continue to build out our Biosciences and Analytical Instruments business, which have better growth prospects; we're accelerating R&D investments. All of those things allow us for a continued improving long-term growth profile for the company and continuing to capitalize on our position as the undisputed world leader in serving science.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "Perfect. One quick point for Pete. Looks like there was a little bit of a change to the amortizable intangibles. Could you just sort of walk through that and whether or not that has any sort of EPS impact or core earnings impact?", "Peter Wilver", "Well, we excluded intangibles from our adjusted earnings per share calculations, so it wouldn't impact our adjusted earnings per share.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "But there was a change in the assumption, correct?", "Peter Wilver", "Not in terms of an assumption. I mean, we hit the end of the Kendro amortization, so the number went down slightly. But that was the only thing that I'm aware of [indiscernible] (0:37:36.9).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Marc, in your comments, I think you talked a little bit about pharma maybe getting tougher. I just want to kind of parse that out a little bit. I've always kind of been of the view that you're able to gain traction among your pharma customers, despite some of the consolidations. So can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing from your top accounts, the top 20? And then are you seeing more interest in strategic agreements like you have with Lilly? If you could just talk about the dynamic on pharma, that would be helpful.", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So, Tycho, once again, this was another quarter where our top accounts grew faster than the company average. From everything that we read, we continue to gain share at those accounts. So I think clearly, the strategy that we have is being executed well and our customers appreciate the value proposition. So I feel very good about that. I'd put just the additional context, which is I think with all the site closures, I just think you have pharmaceutical customers, in general, just tightening up on capital spent right now, and I think that's going to continue at least through the third quarter. Do I think that's a permanent trend? No, I don't. But do I think it's a shorter-term thing that companies in our space face in the market? Sure. And like our position better than everybody because we have a unique value proposition that helps our customers through more challenging times.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And is there risk, I guess, in the near-term that there's a glut of kind of used equipment coming on the market with the site closures? Or I mean how do we think about whether that's going to be disruptive?", "Marc Casper", "There have been site closures in the past. You see stuff in second hand. It really has never materially affected, I think, anybody in terms of performance, in terms of really that much stuff coming at our markets. So I don't think that'll be a big issue.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Just a question on the M&A deals. With Fermentas and Finnzymes, you've got some nice products and PCR. Can you talk a little bit about where you see your PCR franchise going? And how you're looking to build that out?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So first of all, PCR is a major product category and I think it's one that as a company, historically, we really didn't participate much in, and I think it's important that we do participate in the market. The two acquisitions that you mentioned, Finnzymes and Fermentas, it really just helped strengthen our offering. It adds enzymes, reagents that obviously complement some of the existing products that we had as well as Finnzymes also adds instrumentation capabilities for us as well. So it's an area that other companies have very large positions. We are an early participant. I think the patent landscape is changing over the next couple of years and I think will be well positioned to accelerate organic growth in our Biosciences business by making some moves now and get ourselves set up for some good growth down the road in that market segment.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then just one last quick one on food safety. You called that out and I think in conjunction with the issues done in the Gulf. Can you quantify that? And is that something we have the think about in terms of presenting comp next year? Or are we at kind of a steady state now where the food testing business is off a reasonable growth rate and it's really going to be impacted?", "Marc Casper", "I don't think you have to worry about the comps. I think you're seeing steady growth there. Particularly, what's going on in the Gulf is not material to our business, but I think it shows you what kind of huge impact we can have with our customers in terms of making a difference in society. But you're not going to hear us talk next quarter or next year about tough comparisons versus food safety as a headwind down in the future.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Marc, could you give us a little color on how the demand was between your kind of high-end Consumables and Instruments and your low end? I mean, did you see any difference? And then kind of as an addition to that, give us an update on your vitality index parameters.", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, In terms of the difference between the high-end Instruments and Reagents and the Basic Equipment, you can essentially look at the two segments, and the organic growth rates were essentially the same. So I would say there's not a material difference between the two pieces of business. And as I said, also you can look at the Instruments and Equipment and Consumables growing at a mid-single-digit growth rate. So it's pretty much across-the-board performance. And in terms of our product vitality, we are seeing an increase year-over-year in our product vitality as a result of some of the investments that we made last year and that we're continuing to make this year. It's not a huge percentage increased but we are seeing an improvement in the metric.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "One of the questions I think that also came around this quarter was China and China demand going forward. A lot of the stuff that you -- you signed contracts, like in oil and gas and the nuclear side environment. I guess what's your long-term view on the commitment to Chinese demand in these areas that Thermo serves?", "Marc Casper", "So Quintin, when you look at the situation in China, I highlighted a couple very different types of examples. One that you've heard a lot about, which is environmental monitoring, instrumentation for infrastructure and that continues to be strong. And we continue to believe that there are good prospects there. We are starting to do more new lab works. And what was particularly interesting about the new lab win that I highlighted in this particular quarter is that it is a Chinese organization. So we've done a lot of new lab establishments, but they've been traditionally for multinationals. And this is a huge government entity that has toured the multinationals, and basically said, \"I want Thermo Fisher to set up my lab.\" When I was over in China last, I met with their new CTO of this organization, and he's excited about equipping those laboratories with our equipment. When I look forward to what's going on in China, I think it's always helpful to know that the comparisons bounce around every quarter. So we don't expect smooth, steady growth every single quarter, but we do expect China to be the fastest-growing geography for a number of years to come. And we see a broad-based growth prospects for the business.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Pete, could you give us kind of the update on the major margin drivers, kind of quantify raw materials and sourcing and PPI? And also talk about the net pricing contribution you realized, both top and kind of direct margin, if you will, in the quarter.", "Peter Wilver", "I'll start with the pricing. As we said last quarter, the pricing environment is a little bit tougher today, specifically on routine instrumentation, than it has been in the past. So we're not seeing as significant contribution from price. On a gross level, it's around 1%, where in the past, we've seen more like 1\u00bd% and 2%. So that contribution is not as strong. In terms of PPI, global sourcing and the other cost actions that we took last year, that's having a pretty significant positive impact on our EBITDA margin year-over-year to the tune of, we could say, one and a half to two percentage points. That's being offset, obviously, by inflation, which we start out the year every year in a hole and also some of our investment in R&D and commercial resources, which is diluting margins by around 50 basis points or so.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "That comment, the 50 basis points was inflation, R&D and commercial? Or just R&D and commercial?", "Peter Wilver", "No, just R&D and commercial. The inflation doesn't quite offset the productivity but it's a pretty significant number.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. And then just commenting on the Asia. You commented that that your Asia growth was mid-single digits. Was that off a harder comparison? I'm surprised that growth rate's not a bit higher. And I'm just forgetting exactly what happened in this period last year in terms of the Asia comp, if you will.", "Peter Wilver", "The Asia comp was a little tougher last year. It wasn't a huge comp. The toughest comp that we had was rest of the world, which is a high-single-digit positive number. I think in Asia, we're just looking at some timing. Obviously, in Q1, we had a huge order in Japan. So we don't have that particular volume in Q2. So I think it's just timing of orders rather than a comparison issue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Marc, can you maybe just talk a little bit more, you made a couple acquisitions in the PCR and you answered some questions surrounding those. But can you maybe broaden that out a little bit more, I guess, in terms of maybe your appetite for moving into some of the other areas of genetic analysis within the life sciences side of your end markets maybe one of the faster-growing buckets? And I think previously, there was a little bit more reluctance to move in there, and I don't know if you're looking at PCR as a unique situation given some of the patent issues or if there's a bit more of an appetite to maybe move into some of those other markets.", "Marc Casper", "So when you look at the acquisitions, Jon -- let me answer it. Let's look at what we've done this year. We spent a little over $500 billion. And what we have focused on, certainly, in 2010 is buying businesses that serve attractive markets, that in our combination with our business, will help us accelerate growth and that we add unique value. So you can just look at something that's more industrially oriented, kind of field-based, Ahura Scientific, while we have the best channel to market with our portable elemental analyzers. We have an incredible stable of spectroscopy technologies. You put those two businesses together, it not only serves a more attractive market, on average, but also, we bring unique value to it. If you look at our bioscience acquisitions, both in Finnzymes and Fermentas, the same thing. We have a very strong Biosciences presence; we didn't participate as much in PCR. These two assets together plus our reach to the market and some interesting changes to the IP landscape gives us an ability to accelerate growth from those businesses. So that's how we think about it. Proxeon, we obviously have great strengths in proteomics. We're adding to the workflow there, again, attractive markets. When we think about genetic analysis, the way we participate today is really on the diagnostics side. We have a very strong presence in doing genetic analysis there. We don't play in the sequencing market in any material fashion. It's not a space that we've spent a lot of time or effort to think about in terms of trying to get into. So that's how we think about the various segments and how we're deploying capital to leverage our unique depth of capabilities and ultimately continue to add to our organic growth long-term.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, thanks. That's helpful. I think in your guidance, Pete, you said you assume that flu would be normal. A lot of people are talking about maybe not having any flu, whatsoever, given a lot of flu in the channel from last year and also just not seeing much in the Southern Hemisphere. And so I'm just curious, if flu were to come in -- if it weren't to be a normal season in the second half, if it were to be more minimal, just what kind of impact would you expect that to have on your guidance, all else equal, obviously?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, that's a very difficult number to get at because our flu revenues are not just the actual flu kits, there's also kind of flu-related revenue based on that sort of tends to drive hospital visits and usage of other consumables that we sell. So it's a tough number to get at. Just to give you an idea, we've already got baked into our numbers a $20 million decline year-over-year because of flu. Between kind of the H1N1 blip, it gives you a rough order of magnitude of what kind of revenue we're looking at there. So it's just impossible to predict what that would be.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Right. So just to clarify, $20 million reduction year-over-year for the second half?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, that's what we have baked into the numbers right now. That's to get back to a normal season.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Pete, first, Biosite is at about $25 million a quarter in the second half?", "Peter Wilver", "No. for the second half, the total impact is around $90 million negative. So it's about $45 million negative. Now we do have an alternative supplier that we're bringing up to speed that's going to offset some of that. So it probably net's down to around $55 million, I guess, pretty close to your $25 million a quarter.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "So in the second half, between H1N1 and Biosite, is that, what, about 200 basis points of impact on organic growth?", "Peter Wilver", "No, not quite 200. It's about 150 basis points, I would say.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "What is the assumption for organic growth in the last two quarters of this year?", "Peter Wilver", "So the range, if you look at our full year guidance range, it's 3% to 5%. So for the second half of the year, it's basically negative 1% to plus 2% is what that range translates to.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Why is that?", "Peter Wilver", "In terms of the negative 1% to plus 2%?", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Yes.", "Peter Wilver", "And I know it feels a bit weak compared to what we've reported in the first half of the year. So again, as I said, if you look at our full year, it's 3% to 5% organic growth. If you take out flu and Biosite, it's more like 4% to 6% growth. If you look at the first half, it 8\u00bd% growth organically, and the midpoint of that guidance range would basically be flat. So we've got 8\u00bd% going to flat. As we talked about, we have a calendar shift between the first and fourth quarters as well as the flu and Biosite headwinds would actually impact the second half more dramatically than the first half. And we also have much different comparisons between the two halves of the year. So if you basically adjust all the results to remove all the noise, the first half grew about 7% organically, that's adjusting for the calendar and Biosite and flu compared to minus 6%. So you've got plus 7% compared to minus 6% in the first half. At the midpoint of our guidance, the second half, again, adjusting for all that, is around 4% growth compared to flat last year. So if you net the two, you basically have flat in the first half and say, positive 2% in the second half. So we're really looking at accelerating growth into the second half of the year.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Okay. And then, Marc, Europe, mid-single digits seems to be a good bright spot, geographically. What's going on there?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of Europe, a few things: One is when I look at the performance of the business, we saw good performance across the geographies. No particular geography within Europe was materially worse than another. And I was particularly pleased because our healthcare-related Diagnostics business did very well. Our industrially related businesses also did quite well. My pharma comments are probably equally true in Europe and North America, where there's a little bit more reticence to spend right now. But we saw a good second quarter. We're paying close attention to what's going on from everything we read about, governmental austerity programs. But on the other side, there's been some early talk about increasing funding in Europe in 2011 for research and innovation, which could be a positive next year as well. So we keep a close eye on it, but right now things continue to progress well in Europe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalli (sic) [Bhalla] from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Just wanted to follow up on that Europe question. Can you talk a little bit about pricing that you're seeing in Europe? I hear what you said earlier about the 1% rising you've gotten overall, but I'm curious about Europe, specifically. And then can you also quantify the impact of stimulus in the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So in terms of pricing, it didn't vary much in Europe versus other geographies in terms of price competitiveness. As Pete said, high-end instruments a little bit more competitive in terms of where pricing environment is globally versus Consumables where pricing is sticking more easily. So we didn't see a big geographic view at this point. From a stimulus perspective, roughly in the quarter, $15 million of revenue. That puts us, when stimulus started last year at about $125 million. We're well within the $100 million to $200 million range. We're well within the range we said this year. We continue to expect to see some stimulus funding in the back half of the year as well.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "You mentioned that the Analytical Instruments were strong in the applied markets. Just wondering if you could expand on Analytical Instrument performance in some of your other end markets, if there were also growth or were there any declines.", "Marc Casper", "Yes, so when you look at our Analytical Instruments businesses, applied markets were strong; portable analyzers, which serves broad-based industrial was strong; in general, mass spec did well. There was nothing that we really had very significant headwinds, other than our part of our Process Instruments business, which is our metals and minerals business, the very, very long cycle economically capital-intensive business. Those are late-cycle business. That still is weak, but there's some brighter spots starting to pick up there as well. So the things you'd expect to be picking up in this stage of the economy define. The very late cycle stuff is still a few quarters out, but in general, I feel good about what's going on in Analytical Instruments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Marc, you commented about the industrial markets having easy comps and improving. But the question is can you say that on a sequential basis, such that even in the back half, that would be an improvement?", "Marc Casper", "So the comparisons get, as Pete said, broadly tougher in the second half of the year, which will make the organic growth number on a reported basis a little bit lower. But I believe that the end markets will continue to improve slightly as the year progresses. So I think that the market conditions are continuing to improve. The late-cycle stuff will slowly improve as well, and that means that I'm feeling better about industrial halfway through the year than I did at the beginning of the year. It just translates, as we anticipated, into a very, very strong organic first half and a slower organic growth in the second half. But that's exactly as we articulated in February. We articulated that again exactly in the same way in April. And we're just reminding everybody today in July of how the calendarization works, but we feel that the markets are improving.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much, and, Pete, based upon that articulation for guidance in May, there were comments made, I seem to recall, around the acquisitions contributing 2%. Obviously, FX at that time was $1.22 and currently at $1.29. I'm actually curious if, in fact, your projections for the rest of the year are for a weaker or stronger dollar. And moreover, is the acquisition pace going to decline based upon May versus the second half?", "Peter Wilver", "So the comments back in May -- so what's included in our guidance today is about a 3% tailwind from acquisitions, so that's including all the acquisitions that we've  completed to date. Our forward-looking revenue guidance doesn't include any other assumptions for future acquisitions, so it's just that 3%, which is the acquisitions that we've completed so far. The \u00bd% that I referenced in terms of our guidance in terms of the headwind, that was versus our previous guidance that we gave in our Q1 earnings call. In May, that was sort of a middle point. We chose not to change guidance. We did reference the fact that we had FX headwinds at that point in time and we weren't changing guidance until it settled down a little bit. At this point in time, the rates that we have included in our guidance at this point are lower than they were in Q1, but they are slightly better than what was happening in the May time frame. We just chose not to update guidance at that point in time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkels (sic) [Schenkel] from Cohen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So in your prepared remarks, you stated that end markets are holding up at about levels you saw in the first quarter. Just to be clear, were there any surprises related to, say, sales patterns in Europe or the industrial end market or biopharma related to the broader macroeconomic backdrop that became more pronounced, say, at the end of the quarter and the early part of Q3? Or is it really business as usual, and that's the way it's been throughout the first half?", "Marc Casper", "Pretty much business as usual, very much in line with what we expected, which is slowly improving economic situations. So we weren't surprised. Healthcare, clearly, got a little bit weaker. Hospital visits, doctor visits were down. I don't think anybody had a crystal ball on the particular one. But surprise is a strong word. I'd say that I tried to give you the nuances of each of the segments and what kind of little better, what were kind of little worse, but nothing really surprised us per se.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And nothing more pronounced at the end of the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "No, nothing from a timing perspective that really changed.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. You spent a lot of time talking about hospital weakness, particularly in the U.S. It doesn't sound like things really changed any pronounced way in other geographies. With that in mind, assuming that's correct, if there were to be a slowdown in Europe, should we be concerned about anything along the lines of the destocking dynamics that we saw last year, I believe, to some degree in the U.S. market?", "Marc Casper", "We're not overly concerned about that. The European healthcare portion of our business is not a huge portion of our business. Because in healthcare in particular, within the company, it's more heavily weighted towards the U.S. So even if there were dramatic changes, of which we're not clearly not anticipating, I wouldn't expect that to have a very significant impact on our performance.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Japan was a bright spot for a lot of companies in the first quarter. I'm not sure if you mentioned that in your prepared remarks. If you did, I missed it. But how did Japan fare relative to Q1?", "Marc Casper", "So Japan was phenomenal in Q1. We had an incredible mass spec performance, which we're very proud of, in terms of capturing stimulus funds. The first half was good but the second quarter was clearly weaker than the first, not a surprise, which is why Asia-Pacific growth was around the company average. Now clearly, China and India continue to perform well for us. So broadly, we feel fine about what's going on in Asia.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Does a stronger dollar, at all, increase the likelihood that you might do more M&A in sort of geographies? I'm just wondering if, Pete, that affects the way you guys think about things in a material way.", "Peter Wilver", "No, it really doesn't. Obviously, you can't exactly time those kinds of things anyway. If you look at how quickly the euro changed over the last month or so, it takes a while to close deals, so it just doesn't enter into the equation when we're looking at acquisitions.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Hey, Pete, your net interest expense for the quarter was several million dollars higher than what I was expecting. And it's like [ph] (1:04:22.6) what's your target for that for the full year?", "Peter Wilver", "Well, the net interest expense, probably why it's higher than what you thought it would be is that we had to carry the kind of double debt until we could retire the $500 million note that didn't get retired until July 1. So the full year is basically consistent with what we were saying last quarter, other than we did a couple of acquisitions. So it's between $70 million, $75 million.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Got you. And I know last year -- I'm going back to the question of the Biosite contract. I know last year, you had roughly $20 million headwind in Q1, Q2, Q3. But I thought that was kind of annualized in Q4. There wasn't any problem in Q4. Was there another change in that contract that I completely missed?", "Peter Wilver", "Other than the fact that, yes, it's totally transitioning away from us as of July 1, but we did experience basically not as quick a transition away from us on the BNP product, which was the original contract modification. So we actually did have a little more revenue in Q4 last year than what we might have expected. So that still created a little bit of a tough comp for us, again, this year in Q4.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And the calendar days issues in Q4, that's, by my calculations, somewhere between a negative 2%, negative 3% headwind that it created.", "Peter Wilver", "No, as we said in Q1, we could benefitted about 4% to 5% in Q1, so we expect to lose 4% to 5% in Q4.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And I guess the -- you had about $0.01 impact on FX for this quarter that you took. Is it I mean roughly the same type of impact the next two quarters?", "Peter Wilver", "Well the $0.01 was just the change in guidance. So the full impact of FX -- I don't have it off of the top of my head. I mean the change is basically $0.03 from our previous guidance, so yes, the change is about $0.01 a quarter from where we were before.", "Marc Casper", "So said another way, Derik, when you think about maintaining the guidance effectively, what we're saying is that we're going to offset the FX headwinds that we saw, about $0.03. We feel good about the organic growth prospects and the operating performance and feel like we can offset the FX headwind. So that's really the only thing that changed when you look at last quarter to this quarter.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. And then just one final comment because I'm getting from investors. I mean you have any crystal balls in terms of looking at what happens to the NIH funding and the government funding as you kind of look at next year. There's going to be elections I think 2011. What are your sources telling you?", "Marc Casper", "We don't have a crystal ball. More is always better. That's what we always prefer. There's probably going to be some increase in governmental spending in Europe in that realm. And clearly, what we read and hear about the priorities is that NIH is an important priority. Exactly how that's going to translate into funding is unclear.", "Thanks. So let me just do a couple quick closing remarks. First, we are pleased to deliver the record EPS results that we did in the quarter. We had a very strong first half of the year, driven by our operating performance. That puts us on track to achieve our financial goals for the year. Thanks, as always, for your continued support of the company, and I certainly, and Pete certainly looks forward to updating you next quarter.

Please proceed.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, Diana, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bernd Brust, our Chief Commercial Officer, are available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company.

", "I'll now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen, and thank you, all for joining us. Coming off the heels of our Investor Day just a few weeks ago, we are going to keep our prepared comments short this morning. ", "So let's get started. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth. Revenue grew 6% organically to $906 million, 8% excluding the impact of H1N1 sales in 2009. Operating margins expanded by 290 basis points to reach a record 30.1%, and earnings per share grew 15% to $0.91 for the quarter.", "We are pleased with our results for the second quarter in the first half of the year, which are a reflection of the fundamental strength of the business and the essential nature of our product offering. I'd like to extend my thanks to our teams around the world for their commitment to excellence and relentless focus on execution.", "As I do every quarter, I'll take a few moments to talk about these results, give you an update on the integration and provide some color on the strength of our end markets. First, we continue to be very focused on the integration, and I'm pleased to report good progress towards our goal of putting actions in place that will generate $175 million in annual synergies by the end of 2010. ", "In the second quarter, we continue to execute on an integration plan, including the placement of over 50 dual-branded supply centers around the world and further optimization of our combined eBusiness platforms. We are seeing good traction from these efforts and achieve new records for the number of the total transactions, both in North America and globally, that will process through eCommerce channels.", "In terms of synergy capture, these actions, as well as many others, will generate another $15 million in annualized synergies, getting it halfway to our full year goal. Looking ahead in the second half of the year, we will continue to optimize the programs already started, as well as implement new initiatives, including additional site consolidations and cities where we have multiple offices, continuing to build out the combined eBusiness platforms and optimizing our distribution network.", "Now beyond these integration activities, Life Technologies is well positioned to capture opportunities that will continue to drive strong revenue growth. Commercial execution, coupled with a broad product offering of innovative tools ensures that our products are an essential part of our customers' workflows. Recent launches have gone very well. Customer response to Attune, our flow cytometry offering and the ViiA 7 PCR instrument have been very positive, and the sales of our latest CE instrumentation, the 3500, have reinvigorated that business. Since the launch of the 3500 in Q4 of last year, we have placed approximately 400 instruments and demand continues to be very robust.", "I'll take a moment now to walk you through more notable points on Q2 performance and give some color on what we're seeing on our end markets. The Americas delivered 7% organic growth in the quarter, 10% without the impact of H1N1. End markets in the Americas remain strong, with pharma and biotech continuing to pick up steam. Evidenced by the strong demand for our discovery and assay services business and double-digit growth in bioproduction. On the research side, stimulus-related revenues for the quarter were approximately $10 million, about the same as we've seen in prior quarters.", "Our outlook for the stimulus is unchanged. We continue to estimate that we will generate more than $100 million in stimulus-related revenue over the life of this program. However, since we have not observed the material ramp-up in spending since the third quarter of last year, we estimate that stimulus-related revenues will be around $10 million per quarter in the second half of the year, with the rest of the benefit realized in 2011.", "Europe grew 4% organically in the quarter. Growth for the quarter is slightly less than in recent periods due to the uncertainty about future government funding levels. At this time, we have no reason to believe that there will be declining government funding for our research in major European markets, such as U.K., Germany and France. However, some of our customers have reported that there have been delays in the release of funds from the institutions to researchers. In addition, researchers seem to be cautious in their spending due to fears that future funding may be curtailed. As a result, spending in these countries on both consumables and instruments softened towards the end of the quarter.", "The situation in some of our smaller markets, such as Italy and Spain is slightly different. Funding in these countries have been negatively impacted to some degree as a result of the current economic environment. Revenue growth in these countries was flat during the second quarter. Looking forward to the second half, we expect that for the European region as a whole, revenue growth will be in the low-single digits or mid-single digits, excluding H1N1.", "Moving on to other markets, Asia-Pacific had another strong quarter, growing 19% organically. End markets in the Asia Pacific region remain healthy, particularly in India and greater China, which grew an excess of 30% in the quarter. We were well positioned in these markets to continue to drive robust growth.", "There's no change in our outlook for Japan. In the second quarter, Japan declined 4% organically as a result of a very difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, Q2 of last year included revenue from a large police order, as well as H1N1. Excluding these items, Japan grew 3%, in line with expectations.", "Now before I hand it over to David, I'm pleased to announce earlier this week, our Board of Directors approved a two-year $350 million share repurchase program, which is consistent with our strategy of balanced capital deployment. We intend to begin repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter after we have redeemed the 2% convertible notes in August, and we are within our target leverage ratio of 2x to 2.5x EBITDA. In general, the timing and amount of purchases would depend on quarterly fluctuations in cash associated with operating cash flow, capital expenditures and further debt prepayment. ", "We remain committed to the financial goals we've outlined previously, and our priorities for cash remain the same. We will continue to pay down debt to keep our leverage within 2x to 2.5x EBITDA, as well as make investments in the business that will drive future growth and then return excess cash to shareholders. ", "And with that, I'll turn it over to David.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $906 million. Currency had a positive impact of 1.5 percentage points on reported revenue growth. And acquisitions and divestitures contributed half a point to growth. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6% organically.", "Genetic Systems had revenue of $235 million, representing 7% organic growth. Sales of CE instruments, including the new 3500 Genetic Analyzer and sales of CE consumables to research and clinical labs, grew in the mid-single digits. This was partially offset by a year-over-year decline in CE instruments and consumables sold into the applied markets, as this business experienced a difficult year-over-year comparison due to the Japanese police order received in 2009.", "Customer feedback on the SOLiD 4 and ECB platforms continues to be very positive. As a result, the Next-Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth during the quarter. At this point, approximately half of the installed base of SOLiD 3.5 instruments has been upgraded to the SOLiD 4 platform.", "Molecular Biology Systems grew 2% organically to $434 million in revenue. Excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 6%. Growth was driven by strong results in the Genomic Assays and Molecular Biology Reagents businesses. Demand for Genomic Assay products grew in the high-single digits. The Molecular Biology Reagents business grew in the mid-single digits and benefited from strong double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, particularly China.", "Cell Systems had revenue of $230 million representing 13% organic growth with strong demand across the portfolio. Double-digit growth in bioproduction was driven by continued improvement in demand from European and North American pharmaceutical customers, as well as the timing of large orders.", "The Dynal Beads business also benefited from an improvement in pharma, biotech and clinical diagnostic end markets, resulting in double-digit growth for the quarter. And lastly, our Primary and Stem Cell business grew in the mid-teens, driven by worldwide demand for both media and reagents --", "As I mentioned earlier, currency added 1.5 points of growth to revenue for the quarter, including the impact of our hedging program. The positive impact to EPS was approximately $0.04, including foreign currency effects accounted for in revenue and other income.", "Moving on to other items. Second quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 67.7%, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the prior-year quarter. This improvement was primarily due to positive price realization, synergies, manufacturing productivity and an increase in royalty revenue, partially offset by a mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by 60 basis points due to currency and increased sales of lower margin bioproduction products. ", "Second quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year's levels to $341 million. This was as a result of headcount additions related to acquisitions and increase in depreciation resulting from capital expenditures associated with the AB and Invitrogen integration and currency. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 1%, mainly due to currency.", "Non-GAAP operating income was $272 million, an increase of 19% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 17% excluding currency. This quarter, operating margins reached a record level of 30.1% representing 290 basis points of improvement year-over-year. This operating margin expansion primarily resulted from improved gross margins and synergies.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, $1 million from currency gains and interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 29.5%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191 million shares. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price in the quarter due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.58, which includes $0.21 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.09 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.91.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow, our ending cash and short-term investments were $706 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $642 million. Cash from operating activities was $228 million, capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $203 million. Included in our cash flow from operations is approximately $25 million of favorability associated with hedges on inter-company loans as a result of increased volatility and currency rates. Return on invested capital increased 40 basis points to 9%.", "Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.64 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $1.1 billion and our senior notes of $1.5 billion. For the first half of 2010, revenue increased 8% organically, gross margins expanded 130 basis points and operating margins expanded 310 basis points. We feel good about our results thus far and are focused on continued execution in the second half of the year.", "With that, I'll now move on to our expectations for the rest of this year. EPS is now expected to be in the range of $3.35 to $3.50. Our full year guidance for organic revenue growth is unchanged and is still expected to be in the mid to high-single digits.", "Given Greg's commentary on stimulus and end markets, I'll provide a bit more color on second half of  expectations. As a reminder, when we provided guidance in the beginning of the year, we stated that the difference between mid and high-single digit organic revenue growth was dependent on the amount of stimulus-related revenue that would be recognized during the year. We've not seen a notable increase in quarterly stimulus-related revenues since the third quarter of last year.  As a result, we expect second half organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits. Revenue from prior acquisitions will add approximately one point to growth in each quarter. ", "In terms of year-over-year comparables, keep in mind that in the second half of 2009, we had $15 million of H1N1 revenue per quarter, approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter from the Japanese police order and stimulus revenues of $15 million.", "Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, I'll provide some detail on the expected impact of currency on our results. With rates as of June 30 and including the impact from our hedging programs, currency is expected to have a small negative impact on revenue, and no impact on EPS in the third quarter.", "In the fourth quarter, currency is expected to have a negative three-point impact to revenue growth, and EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by $0.04 to $0.05. Q3 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter and a decline in royalty revenue. Operating expenses in Q3 are expected to be approximately the same as in Q2. ", "As we indicated on the last earnings call, we are reinvesting a portion of the operating-income impact from stimulus back into the business to fund future growth opportunities. These investments, which are primarily focused on R&D and commercial projects in emerging markets, began late in the second quarter and will continue through Q3. As a result, R&D expense as a percentage of sales in the third quarter will be slightly higher than our full year guidance. We continue to expect full year R&D expense to be 10% to 10.5% of revenue.", "Q3 operating margins are expected to be approximately the same level as last year. For the full year, operating margin expansion is still expected to be within 175 to 225 basis points. We expect the average diluted share count for the second half of the year to be $192 million to $194 million shares assuming an average stock price between $45 and $50.", "And finally, we've received a number of questions on our hedging programs as it relates to next year. Because of the continued uncertainty about the global economy and the resulting impact on exchange rates, we opted in June to continue with our currency hedging program in 2011. At this point, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011 and intend to execute additional hedges each month until we are hedged for the full 12 months. Share repurchase program will be used to help mitigate the impact of currency on EPS.", "And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, David. A quick note before we get started. Recently we've received feedback from a number of you that one-on-one calls are preferable to the post earnings Q&A call. For this reason, we will not be holding a post call today. If you have questions following this call, please contact me directly. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A, so I would like to ask everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions that you'd like to ask, please get back in the queue. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from the line of Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Greg, could you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing, I guess, in Europe? I mean, it sounds like the spending slowed as delay of release of funds. What kind of visibility do your customers get in terms of when some of those funds will be released? And then, kind of, what's the long-term forecast for Europe, given the fact that those are big research mandate that was just put forward in terms of 2011 budgets?", "Gregory Lucier", "I think what we saw in the second quarter was a reaction to the heightened sensitivity around the whole European fiscal crisis. And so that seemingly had a ripple effect through spending at the bench level on a company like ours towards the end of that second quarter. Now that's kind of a short-term reaction, and that's why our comments are that, perhaps that could persist a bit through the second half of the year. On long term, the second half of your question, it's unclear, but our opinion is that this side of government funding will probably remain intact. And it centers around what you said in that, the larger countries are committed to a agenda of innovation. And therefore, at least in their public pronouncements that we can understand, they have said they're going to ring fence innovation funding, and so again, we rely on that to say that over the next couple of years, the European business should do okay. So that's what we know at this point. We're not predicting dire consequences, and yet at the same time, we think the robust growth we saw in the last couple of years may be modulated a bit over the next couple of years.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "The improvement that you're seeing in U.S. pharma, is it broad-based or are you seeing maybe increased growth from companies that have completed some of their recent M&A activity?", "Gregory Lucier", "What we've always seen in that pharma sector is an account-by-account variability. And so our top accounts are not always our top accounts year-over-year. It just changes depending on their own particular spending or situation they find themselves that may be due to an integration. So overall, we're certainly seeing, in aggregate, a nice recovery. But the individual companies and their respective growth rates has changed this year versus last year.", "Operator", "Next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "First, in Molecular Biology Systems, that seems to be an area that some folks are pointing to as a blemish on an otherwise good quarter. By my math, when you strip out the impact of H1 [H1N1] in Japan, and I think you highlighted this, you did 6% organic growth in the quarter. I just want to make sure that this was consistent with your expectations given the comps and make sure that nothing is changed regarding competitive landscape or the environment relative to where you were in Q1. And then the second question kind of related to organic growth, David, if you mentioned this I missed it, but could you just talk about how H1 versus H2 compares organically when you strip out all the one-timers that you mentioned for the first half and the second half?", "Gregory Lucier", "Doug, on the first part of your question, your math is correct. The Molecular Biology business had organic growth around 6%, and you have to remember that's a very large franchise. So that's 6% on a big number. So actually, I think the results were very robust actually, and I think it also is indicative that we continue to invest in Molecular Biology. Respective in one of those segments in the PCR franchise, we have the broadest product offering by far. We have millions of assays available on demand, and it really is the standard that people continue to come to more and more. So we feel very good actually about the Molecular Biology results, so I'm glad you clarified that. David, on to you in terms of the second question Doug asked.", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes. So Doug, so just let me repeat in terms of what was the impact on H1N1 and the other onetime items on our results for last year and our second half results. So H1N1, we had $15 million of revenue per quarter last year. Another major item was the Japanese Police order, and that was approximately $8 million to $9 million per quarter last year. And then finally, we had stimulus revenues in the second half of $15 million, and that was $5 million in the third quarter and $10 million in the fourth. That answer your question?", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Yes, it does. I mean, I guess part of the reason I asked this is there has been some concern in the quarter with some other companies that organic growth optics don't look good and that organic growth is actually slowing down in the second half. I'm just doing a quick math based on those headwinds, which frankly, you did outline last quarter as well, so those are nothing new. And I want to make sure my math is correct that when you strip the headwinds out of the first half and then you strip headwinds out of the second half, it actually looks like, even though you're guiding organic growth to mid single digits in the second half, that it actually looks like things are accelerating in the second half if you strip everything out. Is that the right way to think about things?", "David Hoffmeister", "That is correct. We don't anticipate any significant change between the first half and the second half.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe just first question for David on kind of the margin improvement, and understanding your comments about kind of the third quarter and how you're going to be reinvesting. Well, can you talk a little bit about how much of what you're seeing here is sustainable? And I asked because I know at your analyst day, you highlighted a lot of productivity initiatives and you highlighted things like non-refrigerated TaqMan reagent and things that seemingly should have a nice impact on margins going forward. So can you talk about kind of the sustainability of manufacturing productivity? And I don't know if you can quantify how much this quarter came from price versus royalty versus some of those productivity enhancements.", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes. Yes, I mean, you're absolutely right, Tycho. We did talk at Investor Day a lot about this. Nothing is changed. We continue to expect to get 50-plus basis points of operating margin improvement over the next several years. So we believe that the changes that we make are sustainable, and that we've got further improvements that we can make. In terms of the impact of price, we continue to get price improvement that is in line with what we've had in the past, and we're averaging one to two percentage points of price. And it has, through the upheaval in the economy over the last couple of years, not changed, and we're seeing that same type of improvement this year.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I mean, from this quarter, the 100 basis points you saw, can you break out how much was from price versus other factors?", "David Hoffmeister", "I can't do that right off the top of my head at this point.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe then just a follow-up for Greg on SOLiD. As we think about the launch of hq later this year and then obviously the PI at the lower end, could you talk a little bit about where you're seeing interest from customers in terms of core academic centers and then the non-traditional markets for SOLiD?", "Gregory Lucier", "You bet, Tycho. I have Mark Stevenson here with me. I'll let Mark answer that in more detail.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, Tycho. So we continue to see uptake of genome centers, the smaller genome centers that are getting into this, particularly in the area of cancer where we see the accuracy that we get with the SOLiD System, really an uptake in that one. People want to do those kind of experiments. You saw some of the announcements we've made and some of the uptake in some of the cancer centers both here in North America and in Europe during the last quarter. And we expect, as we launch the SOLiD PI, we'll broaden that base and with the hq, bring the cost of the genome down even further and so continue to see good progress into the market with the SOLiD technology. We also mentioned in the script a very good feedback on the EZ Bead, which is taking away. One other thing important to our customer and the workflow is much more simple and straightforward upfront sample preparation now with that EZ Bead System.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Can you talk about Bioproduction? You called that out as being strong. How sustainable are the trends there, and kind of what you're visibility to the back half of the year for that business?", "Mark Stevenson", "We feel good about the Bioproduction business. Again, it's account-specific. But the macro environment for us, we continue to see uptake across that, and have actually broaden our portfolio there with the introduction of more assays and products into the Bioproduction area as they continue to see that's a good market for us.", "Operator", "Derik De Bruin, UBS Securities.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So just to follow up on some of Quintin's questions on the funding environment. There's also, obviously, been a lot of concern from amongst people about what happens in the U.S. following the midterm elections. And I guess, what are you looking at now in terms of what are you hearing on the NIH budget in fiscal 2011 and the initial take on fiscal 2012? And I guess, what are your embedded expectations in terms of budget increasing?", "Gregory Lucier", "Here's what we currently believe, that the NIH budget in 2011 will probably be up by about $1 billion if the House Appropriations recommendations hold. So over the next 12, 18 months, funding should be pretty good. Into 2012, I think it's a bit more uncertain. But potentially, the NIH could be flat to slightly down. Inside of that though I will tell you that a lot of our work is preparing around where the money would be spent, because it won't just be everything 5% or 3% or flat. There will be changes in how the funding actually gets spent, and we certainly saw this earlier in the Bush administration and I think we learned pretty smartly on how to navigate that. So again, the next couple of years then because of, at least stimulus, the 2011 NIH budget being probably okay and growing, and then the changing and funding towards where we see real strength in our portfolio, the next couple of years should be okay in United States.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Thanks for the color on the FX impact for next year. I guess when we start thinking about where your hedges are in place, what's the euro-dollar number that you kind of got -- the exchange you kind of have the hedging blend [ph] so we can kind of watch that?", "Gregory Lucier", "You're talking about next year?", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Next year, yes.", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, I think we need to go through the second half of the year before we know what our rate is going to be. But we'll provide that, obviously, when we talk about our outlook for next year.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And you had given some general rules of thumb. I'm looking at the impact of currencies on EPS for this year, a 10% move has you -- I think you said it was a $0.06 impact or something like that. It's like, I guess, would those same types of rule of thumb hold for these next hedges, or is it that bar has reset?", "Gregory Lucier", "Bar has reset.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "First question, just more -- I know there's been a lot of questions about this, but maybe to take a step back and just kind of talk about how does Life grow and what are the strategies for growth if, given the exposure to academic, market and government funding broadly as we think about that for the long term, if it is a flattish funding environment. How do you guys think about growth opportunities? Do you deploy capital differently? Sort of what's the strategy, and how are you thinking about that?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, first of all, about 30% of our portfolio is in what we call the broadly applied biology segment. So Forensics, Bioproduction, Animal Health, and those segments are growing very fast, and we see them continuing to grow as a percentage of the portfolio. So that's a good thing. Second, in terms of academic funding over the next couple of years, I think if you take my earlier comment, we think it's going to be okay. It's probably more of the funding environment we saw in the 2003 and '04 type of time frame, and we actually grew okay through that period by really focusing the portfolio on where the money would be spent. And I think that a very important point to be made is that all products aren't equal, and the funding does get directed then in a certain way and you just simply have to have the portfolio to capture it. So I think we're feeling pretty good that we'll be able to do well in the overall funding environment in the U.S. and Europe. And then lastly, importantly, is the geographic aspect, which is, we have built a very robust infrastructure across Asia. And I think you can see the benefits of that investment by our continued very strong growth across Asia. We are direct in a lot of the main countries. We're going ever more direct in all of the countries. We're building logistics centers across the region. And so geographically, we're exposed to where higher growth will be. So when you couple all of that together, Life Technologies will do fine over the next couple of years.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "I know you guys had talked about, with the convert out of the way, starting a buyback program. And obviously, free cash flow will start to inflect in 2011. So would just be curious as we kind of move past this, maybe you could give your kind of updated high-level thoughts on -- are buybacks likely to be the major use of capital in this $350 million over two years. So is that how you guys are thinking? So is that going to be the major strategy, or is there more opportunities on product tuck-in acquisitions?", "David Hoffmeister", "I think our philosophy and our plans for use of cash are unchanged. Our number one priority is to pay down our debt. And as we've said many times before, target is to get and remain within a leverage ratio of 2 to 2.5x EBITDA. Second point that you bring out is we're going to continue to invest in the business organically and inorganically. And then third, our philosophy on excess cash also remains the same. We intend to return that to shareholders. A primary vehicle that we've used is share repurchases, and we will continue.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jon Wood, Jefferies & Co.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So David, you will be within your target leverage ratio next week, correct, when you pay out the convert?", "David Hoffmeister", "Actually, there are a variety of ways of calculating the leverage ratio. So the one we've most often use is our credit agreement, but each of the rating agencies also have a calculation. Moody's, for example, is slightly different than ours. That's why we're saying that by the end of the third quarter, we will be within our target leverage ratio for all of the rating agencies on all of the calculations and anticipate to begin the buyback then in the fourth quarter.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then on the cash flow statement, can you just disclose the divestiture proceeds from the mass spec [mass spectrometry] JV, and then talk about whether you've paid the taxes yet on that proceed number?", "David Hoffmeister", "That's a good question, Jon. Why don't we get the answer to that, and we'll have a follow-up conversation with you on it.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Jon Groberg, Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So just one quick question for you Greg. You've often talked about one of the strengths of the portfolio is that it's not that price-sensitive, and in terms of when you tried lowering prices, it hasn't really stimulated a lot of demand and that's why you get some price -- a lot of good pricing ability. Then I'm just curious, specifically within the PCR portfolio, have you tried that overtime? I'm just curious, there's been some, obviously, a lot of announcements around people trying to get more into that business. I'm curious just you view of how effective price is as a mechanism in the PCR space.", "Gregory Lucier", "I think what gets highlighted is in that particular space, there's a lot of the very low end reagents and otherwise. And actually, they've always been around, at least for the last several years, kind of the low end of that segment. We have products from that segment as well. So my comments really still pertain globally to this business, that the relationship between price and volume is not a direct connection. And that's due to a lot of the friction of publications, previous experiments. There's just inertia to switching. And when you have market leadership like we certainly do in the PCR business, people are inclined to stay with their products, and so we benefited from that.", "Operator", "Your next question will come from the line of Steven Lichtman, Oppenheimer & Co.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "First, I was wondering the update on single molecule, still expecting to have a beta launch here towards year end?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, we still, as we updated at the Investor Day, making good progress in developing the system and continuing to engage with customers around the early access and discussing the experiments and applications that they see for single molecule sequencing.", "Steven Lichtman - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.", "And then on CE, certainly seemed like it's picked its head up here a bit more than expected. Is it really driven by the launch of the 3500? Anything else in the sort of end markets you can comment on relative to CE?", "Mark Stevenson", "The CE, as we expected with the launch of the 3500, that really goes into markets such as the clinical testing market. We have the CE-IVD mark. Recently, we launched assays that start to go into that like a  BRAF assay. And so we see that uptake falls forward into that CE space. In addition in the Forensics space, launching more kits, more geographic expansion. And they see franchise is robust in that segment, continues to be the right technology choice for those applications where you have a couple of genes that are very variable that you want to analyze.", "Operator", "And the last question will come from the line of Tony Butler, Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "David, is there any way to characterize the revenue synergies in the quarter that you may be seeing with the combination of the companies?", "Gregory Lucier", "Would you like to talk about some of the -- I think sources of revenue synergies would be helpful.", "Bernd Brust", "Sure. In the revenue synergy sources, we touched on a few in the earlier comments around combined supply centers, leveraging our combined website. When you look today at the portfolio, where many of these types of sources were purely tied to one of the companies, they're now combined. Our selling organization has been restructured where commercial teams we have consumables, sales reps have carried both the AB [Applied Biosystems] consumables as well as former Invitrogen consumables. It gives our instrument teams more time to focused on -- focusing on instrument placements. And so all of those combined, they have driven many of the synergies that we have indicated in our earlier calls.", "Operator", "And this concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Eileen Pattinson for closing remarks.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you. This concludes our second quarter earnings conference call. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. This webcast will be available via a replay on our website for three weeks.

Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So first kind of a housekeeping. So what's the interest expense forecast for 2010? I guess, could you talk about -- I think you have some converts coming up in 2011, can you just talk about the debt claim plans and what you're expectations are for the converts?", "Gregory Lucier", "The first part of your question was the interest expense?", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Yes, for 2010. I mean, another kind of pay downs of things. I'm just questioning where the expense numbers are coming out?", "Gregory Lucier", "So the interest expense is $110 million to $120 million. And then in terms of the converts, it obviously depends on the share price, but assuming the share price continues to rise, we would expect to retire or call those converts when they're due.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And I guess I'm a little bit -- I think I'm a little bit surprised and certainly, that I think some of the investors are going to be surprised the fact that you're reporting double-digit growth in your SOLiD franchise. And I guess a couple of questions. Are you still on track throughout the SOLiD, the upgraded SOLiD, the hq, by the end of the year? Is the throughput commentary that you still have on that the same? I think it was a 200 g [ph] throughput per round there. And I guess, just where are those labs that you're placing new instruments in?", "Mark Stevenson", "First, just to confirm, actually it was a strong double-digit growth that we experienced in the quarter and it was the best quarter ever that we've have for SOLiD. So we've got great traction in that and saw that in the overall growth, actually like sequencing brand franchise it's not only solid you see but also strong sales of CE of the 3500. It's really across a range of labs. I mean, with regard to SOLiD, as I've mentioned in the first question, the appreciation of the accuracy is there in terms of both finding these rare mutations as I've said in  the quote sort of needle in the haystack that accuracy matters. And so that's very much appreciated. That also translates into lower throughput cost when you're doing how much coverage you need. So that's one thing. On the second part of your question, we're very much on track to launch the systems. We'll give much more detail about that and our plans next week at ASHG and update you on where we are both on the platforms and throughput, and very much is an upgrade of old parts for all our customers. So they're coming with us on this journey. We've made tremendous improvement in the performance of the system, and they are coming with us on this journey as we carry on and get greater performance out of the system.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist. [Morgan Stanley]", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Just a big picture question on how you're kind of thinking about overall business trends. Typically, you guys talked about closing stronger sort of sequentially into the end of the year, both in terms of margin momentum and organic growth. So given the commentary that you've had, I guess, is there no change in sort of the sequential momentum that you're thinking about it purely a function of the tougher comp from last year? And I guess, on the margin side, sort of a similar question but sort of asking given some of the spending that you delayed this quarter, is some of that going to get pushed in the next quarter so we can kind of think about underlying margin momentum sort of improving sequentially, if we kind of share some of that spend between the two quarters.", "David Hoffmeister", "Right. So really, the commentary on the fourth quarter is nothing but the comparable issue. So as you know, fourth quarter is traditionally one of the larger ones of the overall year. It continues to be. And again, it just relates to the 2009 fourth quarter comp that we have. The way you think about margins is right on. They will increase, but it will be modulated somewhat by the increased spending that we'll have in the quarter on some of these projects.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one follow-up is just on the Molecular Biology Systems trends in the quarter, sort of flat organic, 4% without H1N1. Can you kind of talk about what the kind of biggest trends were there? And any sort of change from last quarter or over the first half, in terms of the sort of excluding H1N1 benefit but kind of the core business there?", "Gregory Lucier", "I think the only commentary about that piece of the business was it was probably more than any other part of our company impacted by the information technology project we had in Asia and the overall -- a little slower growth we had in Asia in the quarter. So again, fourth quarter, we expect Asia to snap back into the high-double digits again, and you'll see that business snap back up to higher organic growth as well.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Charles Butler. [Barclays Capital]", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Greg, a strategy question. You recently hired a medical officer to come on board. I'm curious just exactly to whom would he actually interface? Or is he just providing advice to you all in the board? And moreover, is he actually on board now? Just a very interesting decision.", "Gregory Lucier", "Dr. Paul Billings is on board now. He interfaces with myself, with Mark, with Bernd in terms of customers and the board as well. It's the first several moves you'll see from us and that we will announce to continue to evolve the company to be not only very strong in research, but increasingly strong in medicine. As I've said in the past, all of these molecular tools are getting pulled into the medical environment, and we have to get the company ready to become more hospital oriented, more genomically medicine oriented, and this is the first of the several announcements that you'll here over the next year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg. [Macquarie Research]", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So just one quick clarification, on the FX for '11, Dave, is that a net number in terms of all the other activities you had in place in for '11 as well or is that purely an FX number, the $0.12?", "David Hoffmeister", "Just FX, but is net of our hedges.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Right, but not the buybacks, before you gave the number kind of bracket around some other things. So just FX right now is $0.12?", "David Hoffmeister", "Correct, I understand your question. No, it does not include any buybacks, that's just foreign currency.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And then, Greg, how are you going to go about evaluating the R&D that you've been spending and the money that you spent on Ion Torrent. Can you maybe just talk about one, obviously, there are a lot of new technologies that are percolating out there, companies trying to go public, a lot of people involved in the space. Can you maybe talk about one, how it is that you decided on Ion Torrent. And two, how you're going to kind of evaluate all of the spend that's been going on in the sequencing business, going forward?", "David Hoffmeister", "Well, John, we have been evaluating the technologies associated with sequencing for the last several years. We've had, and we still have, a standing team that is fully 100% dedicated to that effort. And our major requirement for sequencing to really explode the market was a turnaround time, the ability to get fast results. And as we looked at that, we just really came to the conclusion that the current generations of technology wouldn't get you to the measurement of hours in that regard versus the current days. And so Ion Torrent, as we got to understand it better, tested better, understand where it was going, really presented to us the technology that would enable this technology to move into the clinical realm, and that's why we made the acquisition of Ion Torrent. We continue to monitor all sorts of different paths to read the genome. But again, we're quite bullish that we have the right platform here to complement the very high accuracy -- even higher accuracy than it's even known today that Mark will talk about this next week of SOLiD. And yet, get to this turnaround time that I think will become quite essential to really unlock the big diagnostic markets. So that's why we did Ion Torrent. And, yet, I would just finish that we're not resting. We continue to monitor and watch, but we feel very confident that we have a great set of technologies here.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Isaac Ro. [Goldman Sachs]", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "I want to ask some question about NIH funding. I understand the outlook here at a macroeconomic environment level is somewhat uncertain, but I'm just wondering what you guys are assuming for NIH funding growth over the next three to five years?", "Gregory Lucier", "Isaac, next year should be pretty good. We think it'll go up a couple of percentage points, and the stimulus continues to meander along through the course of the next several quarters, which will be okay. So I would tell investors the next year should be fine. As we look to 2012 and beyond, those are the conversations that are taking place today. But as I've said in other settings, I'm actually hopeful that it will be okay. And I think it pertains back to an innovation agenda that a lot of our political leaders see is needed by the United States. And so there's not going to be a mad rush to balance the budget on the backs of the NIH. I mean, quite frankly, that's not where our overspending has been. And so the more of that message, I think, is appreciated and shared by more and more folks, the more I feel better about that NIH will come through this pretty well okay. So that's kind of our current outlook right now.", "Isaac Ro - Leerink Swann", "Second one would be on the PCR business, maybe, David, if you could outline sort of the kind of growth you've seen in that business year-to-date. And then you said switch pricing in PCR has helped drive that growth?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, maybe Mark...", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, I mean, we still see good growth overall in that qPCR market. It's really a breadth of portfolios. So now as we've introduced the ViiA 7, we have a refresh of the high end of our price points in the instrument side and all the way down to the lower price points on that system. And going forward, evermore, we're reinventing that game in terms of how we think about qPCR, both in terms of what you've seen us do in a couple of acquisitions in getting to higher throughput and also moving into the world of digital PCR, which we think is going to be really big going forward here.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Great. This concludes our third quarter earnings conference call. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast will be a available via a replay on our website for three weeks. Thank you, again, for joining us this afternoon.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's presentation. You may now disconnect. Good day.", "Operator", "Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Life Technologies Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. My name is Tony, and I'll be your coordinator for today. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the call over to your host for today, Ms. Eileen Pattinson, Head of Investor Relations. Please proceed.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, Tony, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer.", "In addition, Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer; and Bernd Brust, our Chief Commercial Officer, will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I'll now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen, and thank you all for joining us. I hope you had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. As you can see from our results, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line growth.", "Revenue grew 6% organically to $869 million. And excluding the impact from the H1N1 pandemic, as well as the very large forensics deal for the Japanese police, organic revenue grew 9% for the quarter, driven by strong demand for both instruments and consumables across all of our customer end markets. Operating margins expanded by 170 basis points to reach 29%, and earnings per share grew 19% to $0.87 for the quarter.", "On a year-to-date basis, organic revenue has grown 7.5% over prior year, 9.5% excluding H1N1 and that Japanese police forensics deal. Operating margins have expanded by 270 basis points. These are terrific results for the third quarter and for the year-to-date and is a testament to the execution mindset of our teams from around the world.", "Now this quarter marks the 16th quarter in a row that we have exceeded expectations on both the top and bottom line. I'm particularly proud of this achievement as it demonstrates ability and commitment to deliver consistent, strong financial results to our shareholders.", "Since 2007, EPS has grown at a compounded annual rate of 19% from $2.03 to the current consensus of $3.43, and free cash flow has more than doubled. Looking forward, you can expect the same focus on execution and commitment to great results as you've seen in the past.", "This management team has built an incredibly unique business that is proven to be resilient enough to manage through the ups and the downs of the market that naturally occur over the years. With opportunities for both revenue growth and margin expansion that we see in the horizon, there's just no reason to believe that we will do anything but strengthen our position, allowing us to deliver double-digit organic earnings growth per share in 2011 and the foreseeable future.", "Let me share with you our thinking about how we will deliver on this promise by walking you through a little bit of history. Over the last two years, we've been taking very deliberate average action to set the stage for our future. The planning process began actually several years ago when we set out to create optimal portfolio products. Today, we believe we had the best mix by far in the Life Science tools industry. 20% of our revenue is derived from proprietary instruments, which drive demand for the higher-margin consumables that make up the remaining 80% of our revenue stream. The consumables portion of our portfolio provides stability and add to the resiliency of the company over time. In addition, specific investments we've made over the last few years have refreshened certain aspects of our portfolio, such as PCR, and laid the groundwork for Life Technologies to build leading positions in areas such as synthetic biology and genomic medicine. With the recent close of the Ion Torrent deal, our portfolio optimization is largely now complete. The stage is set for us to leverage this industry-leading portfolio for significant growth.", "The balance of our product portfolio is only part of the story. Our revenues are also diversified by region, affording us a certain level of protection in periods where weakness in any one region could negatively impact a less resilient business. As a result, we've been able to grow to some relatively challenging periods in the last few years.", "Since 2007, Life Technologies has grown organic revenues each and every quarter between 5% and 11%, even during some very difficult funding environment and when the overall market was flat or declining for our competitors. In order to manage regional expansion and the overall growth in volume we have experienced, we have reinvested in the business to build a scalable infrastructure so that new products and technologies could be easily incorporated into our network.", "Since 2007, we have consolidated eight ERPs into two main systems and grown our e-commerce platforms to the point where over 50% of our global transactions are processed through this high-margin channel of the web b2b connection in automated supply centers. Our investment in emerging markets, such as China and India, have enabled us to build out direct sales channels and distribution networks to build and meet the needs of these customers and their growing supply demands.", "As a result of this effort, Life Technologies' unparalleled scale and scope in its commercial, manufacturing distribution capabilities around the globe.", "So with the infrastructure now in place, we look to refine and optimize their operations. Again, since 2007, operating margins have increased 390 basis points from 24.9% to the 2010 consensus estimate of 28.8%. But there is still a lot of room for improvement here. Over the next three years, we will continue to drive significant margin expansion to very specific programs, designed to capture productivity in manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.", "The creation of multi-mix manufacturing site is a very good example of the programs we're working on. Our substantial expansion of the Frederick, Maryland  Campus and the continued growth of our Singaporean operations this year are key to this trust. Through these efforts and others like them, we can maximize operational productivity and expect to be able to deliver margins in excess of 31% in 2013.", "While we are executing on the strategies that I have described to you today, we are also laying the groundwork for future revenue growth. Researchers in every field of science use our products to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Over the next few years, we will leverage our strength in R&D and manufacturing to launch thousands of innovative products in the fastest-growing areas of research.", "We also see a very bright future in applied markets, where for a relatively low cost, we can adapt the technologies used in biological research for use in fast-growing industries, such as forensics, and food and water testing. Over the next few years, we will be focused on building out industry-leading franchises in high-growth technology areas, applied markets and emerging geographies, all of which will be key drivers of growth for the company going forward.", "One of the greatest benefits of our portfolio is that our product mix heavily weighted towards high-volume, higher-margin consumables allows us to generate significant free cash flow on a very consistent and predictable basis. Since the acquisition of Applied Biosystems, our priorities for the deployment of this cash have been to pay down debt, invest in the business and then return any excess cash to shareholders.", "At the end of Q3, we reached our target debt levels, and with the recent acquisition of Ion Torrent, we believe our product portfolio is where it needs to be to drive significant future growth. In keeping with our philosophy of balanced capital deployment, the level of investment to acquire technologies will now come down in the next 24 months to approximately $100 million or so per year. After we have serviced our debt requirement, excess cash will be returned to shareholders.", "So I've given you a little insight on what we've been working towards and more importantly, some thoughts in the future and what we can achieve. We'll go into more detail of our specific plans in the Q4 call in February, but suffice it to say, we are very optimistic about the future and confident in our ability to deliver on our financial goals in the very same consistent fashion that we have now done in the past. The track record is proven.", "Thanks. And with that, I'll hand it over to David to give you an update on the integration and more details on our  financial results for the third quarter.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. This quarter, revenue grew 8% to $869 million. Currency had a positive 0.5 impact on reported revenue growth, and acquisitions added 1.5 points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 6%, and grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police deal.", "Moving on to the divisional results, the Genetic Systems division had revenues of $227 million, representing 12% organic growth. Overall, sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 5% for the quarter, driven by high-single digit growth in consumables and continued strong demand for our recently launched 3500 Genetic Analyzer.", "Growth in this business was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison, resulting from last year's Japanese police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 9% for the quarter.", "The CE business has proven to be incredibly resilient and continues to be the gold standard for many sequencing applications, not only in research, but increasingly in forensics and other applied markets.", "Sales of CE consumables and instruments into hospital clinics and labs for diagnostic testing are particularly strong and have been a major driver of growth for the 3500 instrument.", "Lastly, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated very strong double-digit growth during the quarter, driven by record sales of the SOLiD 4 system. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $415 million, flat to last year. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4%, driven by strong demand for Genomic Assays and the recently launched ViiA 7 PCR instrument.", "Customer reaction to the ViiA 7 has been very positive, and this is the first of several innovations that will refresh our entire qPCR franchise.", "Shelf systems had revenue of $221 million, representing 15% organic growth. Growth was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. The Bioproduction, Dynal Beads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.", "Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: The Americas grew 8%; Europe 5%; Asia-Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 1%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese police order, the Americas grew 10%, Europe 6%, Japan 13% and Asia-Pacific 11%.", "Revenue growth in the Asia-Pacific region is slightly lower than in the past due to the timing of orders and a slowdown in order processing associated with an information systems implementation. This is similar to what we experienced when we implemented systems in Europe and the U.S. The project is now largely complete, and we expect fourth quarter growth for the region to return to historical levels.", "In line with expectations, stimulus-related revenues for the third quarter were approximately $10 million. We also expect $10 million of stimulus-related revenue in the fourth quarter, the same level as prior year.", "Moving on to other items. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.8%, largely unchanged from the same period last year. Higher price and synergies were offset by mix, particularly increased sales of bioproduction and instruments.", "On a sequential basis, gross margin declined by 90 basis points, primarily due to lower fixed cost absorption as a result of lower volume in the quarter.", "Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 3% over prior year levels to $328 million. The increase was a result of acquisition-related headcount additions and an increase in depreciation, resulting from integration-related capital expenditures. Sequentially, operating expenses declined 4% as a result of cost controls implemented in the quarter, including a slowdown in spending on some commercial projects in our emerging markets.", "These projects, such as building out our e-commerce platforms in Asia, are expected to ramp back up in the fourth quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating income was $252 million, an increase of 15% over prior year, including the impact of currency, and 12% excluding currency. Third quarter operating margins were 29.0%, representing 170 basis points of improvement year-over-year. Operating margin expansion, primarily resulted from synergies and other operating expense reductions.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $5 million from currency, and interest expense for the quarter was $27 million.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate was 25.8%. The tax rate is lower in the quarter due to the benefit of a one-time savings associated with the consolidation of foreign entities. This contributed approximately $0.02 to EPS.", "Other items contributing to the lower tax rate are the settlement of prior year IRS audits and an adjustment to account for a higher portion of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions. These other items contributed an additional $0.02 to earnings per share.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was $190.1 million. As you will recall, our share count is impacted by our stock price due to our convertible debt and employee stock options.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.56, which includes $0.22 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB14-1 and $0.06 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.87.", "Moving onto the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $537 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $706 million. Cash from operating activities was $215 million. Capital expenditures were $28 million, and free cash flow was $187 million.", "Return on invested capital increased 20 basis points to 9.2%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.", "Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.3 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $1.5 billion. During the quarter, we retired $350 million of convertible debt.", "As for our ongoing integration efforts, during the quarter, we executed plans to generate an additional $25 million in annualized synergies. Specific actions included the completion of the European back-office consolidation, site consolidations in Asia and the placement of approximately 90 dual-branded supply centers worldwide.", "At this point, we're on track to meet our goal of $175 million in annualized run rate synergies by the end of the fourth quarter, a year ahead of schedule.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect organic revenue growth to be in the mid-single digits, but slightly lower than the third quarter due to a difficult year-over-year comparison. As a reminder, organic growth in the fourth quarter of last year was 11% as a result of several large one-time items. Revenue from acquisitions will add approximately 1.5 points to growth in the quarter.", "Due to the volatility of currency rates over the last couple of months, our estimate of the impact of currency on fourth quarter results has changed. As of September 30 rates, currency is expected to be neutral to the fourth quarter revenue growth and EPS.", "Q4 gross margins are expected to be lower sequentially due to the impact of mix and lower price realization. Operating expenses in Q4 are expected to increase sequentially due to projects and activities that were delayed in the third quarter, acquisition-related expenses and increased depreciation from integration-related capital expenditures. Operating margins for the quarter are expected to expand approximately 150 basis points year-over-year.", "The fourth quarter effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29.5%, and the full year effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 29%, excluding any impact from the R&D tax credit. If the R&D tax credit is extended, then the full year tax rate will be reduced by approximately a point to 28%, and that would add $0.02 to earnings per share.  Our full year EPS guidance does not include any benefit from the tax credit.", "Average diluted shares in the fourth quarter are expected to range from 191 million to 192 million, assuming an average stock price of between $46 and $50 a share. To date, we've repurchased 2.7 million shares at a cost of approximately $128 million, and are on track to complete the $350 million repurchase authorization and the repurchase of shares associated with the Ion Torrent transaction by the end of the year.", "As Greg mentioned earlier, we're proud of our results so far this year and feel good about our ability to deliver on our financial goals. We are nearing the end of a successful integration, and despite minimal impact from the stimulus, we are on track to deliver between $3.48 and $3.52 earnings per share for the year.", "And finally, since the dollar has weakened considerably over the last few months, I'll give you an update on the expected impact from currency on our 2011 results. As a reminder, we have currency hedges in place for the first seven months of 2011. We do not intend to hedge the remaining five months of the year.", "As of September month-end rates, EPS is expected to be negatively impacted by approximately $0.12. In order to help you estimate the effect of currency for 2011, we've calculated the impact on earnings per share if all currencies moved by 5% versus the dollar. And our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same. In this case, the impact on earnings per share would be plus or minus $0.11.", "And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Eileen. Eileen?", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thanks, David. We have about 20 minutes for Q&A, so I'd like everyone to limit themselves to one question and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions after that, please get back in the queueu. Tony, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Quintin Lai. [Robert W. Baird]", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Looks like that it did get a little better from you from last quarter. So kindly give us a little color on what you're seeing now in terms of the market demand, given what you saw in Q2? And then as a quick follow-up, you put out a press release earlier this morning about the single-read accuracy for the SOLiD. Could you give us a little update or maybe a preview of what you're going to show next week?", "Eileen Pattinson", "Yes, Quintin, we actually missed the first part of your question. Could you repeat the first part of that?", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "No problem. So the first part was really just Europe, that was one of the issues that came up on the last call. It looks like they may have been trailing down. And then this quarter, it looked like that you got back on schedule with 5% growth and then 6% excluding H1N1. So just kind of a discussion of just how the trends have been going in Europe.", "Bernd Brust", "This is Bernd. On the European market, as we shared in our last earnings call, we saw some changes in buying behavior. We also thought they were fairly short term, funding already at that point have stabilized in two to three core markets, being Germany and France. Now with the U.K. funding announcement from lastly, I think we have the full picture in place again. So when you look at the European market, I think our outlook of low to mid-single digit growth, the execution is good. The portfolio is holding up against that well. The performance is there, and we see no change in that performance coming in the next foreseeable future.", "Mark Stevenson", "And just a follow up, Quintin, it's Mark here. on the second part of your question. So yes, we're very excited. As David mentioned, we had a record quarter with SOLiD. A lot of that traction was in contour applications where it matters with the accuracy. And so what we've made a great improvement of the level of accuracy to get [4,9] accuracy in a single-read, with new modification to our ligation chemistry and we're showing that data next week at the SHD [ph] meeting.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And is that something that can be immediately implementable now on SOLiD?", "Mark Stevenson", "That will be implemented on SOLiD and we'll start shipping that new Chemistry with the systems, and we'll talk more about that at ASHG.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel. [Cowen and Company]", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "You guided operating margin flat year-over-year in Q3, I think, to about 27.3%. You came in at 29%. I was just hoping you would be willing to tease out really what changed. Was it better than you expected and maybe how much of it is attributable to some of the projects that you referred to as being delayed? And then I guess the second question, kind of building off of a bit, my recollection is you talked about Q4 margin and growth being better than Q3. It sounds like that's no longer the case. So I was just hoping you can maybe explain what's changed.", "David Hoffmeister", "Let me start, Doug, this is David. You're right about Q3. I think in terms of our guidance on Q3, I think what changed is it goes back to Quintin's question. When we look at Q3 at the end of Q2, there were some concerns about weakness in Europe, what the impact would be in terms of sales elsewhere around the world. So we were cautious in terms of what our spending was. And we actually put some of the projects that we intended to begin on hold to get a better idea of what the revenue outlook was going to be. Good news is that revenues came in as we expected or better. And that, combined with lower spending, drove up our margins. What we're saying about Q4 is we're pretty confident in the outlook at this point. I think the markets and the funding around the world has stabilized from what it was at the end of Q2. And we plan to ramp back up some of those programs, particularly, some of the spending in commercial areas and on the web in emerging markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson. [JPMorgan]", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe I just want to jump in with a question on Ion Torrent since this is the first call you've done since you've announced the deal. Can you just talk a little bit about the go-to-market strategy here for the Personal Genome Machine, how we think about early access customers, if there are technical milestones that you'll be announcing along the way? And then are you to targeting kind of a mix at genome centers and in clinical markets initially or how do we think about the initial rollout?", "Gregory Lucier", "Tycho, this is Greg, and I'll have Mark follow up  my point. As you know, we will be launching the Personal Genome Machine here in the fourth quarter. It has been in the hands of early access customers, working through the overall workflow and finishing up the refinement of that. And that particular platform has lots of multi-generational growth in it as well. So it will be launched at a certain throughput, and then it will go up over time in basically the same box. In terms of the target customers, Mark, I'll let you give some a color commentary on how we see it being introduced in the market.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, so we really see, across that range of customers, the applications fit. So I think some of the genome centers are certainly seeing interest to QC some of their application work and do some smaller genomes with it. We'll certainly see it in the decentralized application and some of the smaller genome centers or hospitals and application there is that will light the turnaround time and speech, just a number of experiments that you can do. And so really be quite a broad go-to-market approach for us. We're initially starting, we started taking orders across that breadth of customer base. And we'll be talking more again next week during SHD with that customer set and also at the Association Molecular Pathology meeting, one of the early access customers who we're presenting some data. So we'll begin to see more data here as we start shipping units at the end of December.", "Operator", "And your next question will come from the line of John Wood. [Jefferies & Company]", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "I think just probably for Mark. This might be too early as well, but talking to your customers last couple of weeks since the Europe budgets were announced. Is there a sense of relief or incremental concern versus their expectations going into those budgets.", "Bernd Brust", "John, it's Bernd. No, I think to the sense of relief, obviously the only new one in recent history is the U.K. They both, Germany and France, they have announced some time ago in the U.K. the doomsday numbers were significantly worsened. I think, actually it was the best case scenario that was announced. And so I think in general, there's relief and people are feeling good about what the next few years hold from a research funding point of view.", "Jeffrey Loo - S&P Equity Research", "And Bernd, do you think that there's been any pent-up demand just as people kind of held back in front of those numbers or is that a stretch at this point?", "Gregory Lucier", "I think it's been a stretch. I think, materially, there won't be much change there. I think what you will see is much more consistency, right, as we saw in Q2 last time, a result in changes in volume toward the end of the quarter and I think you're going to see that balance out more now.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin.

My name is Carmen, and I'll be your coordinator for today. And welcome to the Thermo Fisher Scientific Third Quarter 2010 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the", "call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcast and Presentations, until Friday, November 26, 2010. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 3, 2010, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and available on the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during the call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone and thank you", "for joining us for our 2010 third quarter earnings call. We're very pleased to report excellent financial results, highlighted by record third quarter EPS performance. As I outlined earlier this year, we are intensely focused on achieving strong EPS growth, and we successfully delivered on that goal again this quarter. We are also pleased to announce that we are raising our EPS and revenue guidance for 2010, which we will discuss later during the call.", "Let me begin by reviewing our Q3 results at a high level. As you saw in our press release, adjusted earnings per share grew 50% to our record $0.90 versus $0.78 in the 2009 quarter. I'd like to focus on the three key drivers of our EPS performance. The first, top line revenue growth; the second, operating excellence; and the third, disciplined capital deployment. So let me start with covering top line revenue growth. Revenues for the third quarter increased 6% to $2.68 billion compared with $2.53 billion in the 2009 quarter. Our Analytical Technologies segment contributed significantly to our revenue growth in the quarter. In our Analytical Instruments business, which you may recall had a solid first half, we saw even stronger revenue performance in Q3. In addition, our Clinical Diagnostics and Biosciences businesses continue to report strong growth. In our Laboratory Products and Services segment, sales of equipment and consumables were strong across academic and government, biopharma and industrial end markets.", "I'll now turn to our second EPS growth driver, which is operating excellence. Let me start by saying how proud I am of our teams and how they delivered excellent operating performance in the quarter. Their sharp focus on successfully executing on their plans lead to solid Q3 results and positions us well to achieve our goals for the full year.", "Our proven operating discipline also gives us the distinct advantage of being able to invest for the future. As we outlined at the beginning of the year, our plans for 2010 included increasing our investment in both technology innovation and emerging markets.", "In Q3, we ramped up our R&D spend by 30 basis points year-over-year to expand our pipeline of new technologies. We also increased SG&A expense to continue to build our presence in emerging markets, particularly, Asia. One of the fruits of this investment is our new China Technology Center in Shanghai. This resource is focused on developing products and technologies in China, for China. In other words, specifically geared to the needs of our customers in that important market place.", "It's important for me to note, even with these significant investments, we achieved 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion during the quarter. Our excellent operating results are tied largely to a culture of practical processes improvement or PPI, which as you know, is how Thermo Fisher increases productivity to better serve our customers around the world. PPI and PPI Lean will continue to be important contributors to our operating results.", "The R&D investment that I highlighted a moment ago, demonstrate that Thermo Fisher is a company that is committed to innovation. Let me give you a couple of recent examples. As you saw in our press release, we introduced a substantially improved mass spectrometry base workflow for immunosuppressive analysis. This workflow, which includes our new test kits, a new automated sampling handling technology, is used at clinical research to closely monitor levels of drugs in patients, very important for preventing harmful side effects or organ rejection after transplant for instance.", "In our Specialty Diagnostic business, we had two significant product milestones. One with the U.S. FDA clearance of our new diagnostic test designed to screen for VRE. This is an antibiotic-resistant infection that is often transmitted in hospitals. Basically, we developed one of the first color-changing test that allows health care workers to easily, and therefore, more routinely test for the presence of this infection.", "The second product milestone was that of developing our new Cryostat technology. This is used by our customers in pathology laboratories to safely process tissues for cancer diagnosis. And it was selected to be an R&D 100 award winner.", "I'm also pleased to announce the formation of our Scientific Advisory Board. This new board consists of technology leaders within Thermo Fisher and representatives with some of the world's most premier centers of health, science and education. It's primary purpose is to formalize the two-way exchange of technological information, by bringing together some of the brightest minds in our industry. The insight and distinct expertise of each member of our advisory board will be invaluable as we set a course for the innovation of new products and services that will meet the changing needs of our customers.", "The third key contributor to our EPS growth is our ability to effectively deploy capital. As you've heard me say before, we take a disciplined approach to capital deployment. Since the beginning of the year, we deployed approximately $1.2 billion in total, split almost equally on share repurchases and acquisitions. Specifically, we've invested $660 million to repurchase our stock and approximately $550 million on M&A. With the current valuation of Thermo Fisher stock, we believe that reinvesting in ourselves is very attractive. In September, our Board approved an additional $750 million of share repurchases on top of our existing authorization, bringing our total buyback authorization to $1.5 billion since April of 2010.", "In the third quarter alone, we spent $475 million to repurchase 10.1 million of our shares. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $840 million remaining under our buyback authorizations.", "We also continue to deploy our capital on acquisitions. The most recent example is our acquisition of Fermentas for $260 million, which we completed in late July. To remind you, Fermentas provided a broad range of technologies for high quality molecular and cellular biology research to enhance Thermo Fisher's existing genomics portfolio. The Fermentas transaction, combined with our earlier acquisition of Finnzymes, and the launch of our new qPCR assays also strengthens our depth of capabilities in the high-growth market for PCR-based testing.", "I'm pleased to report that the acquisitions we've made in the last 12 months are exceeding our expectations. Although not part of our organic growth calculation just yet, these businesses are growing faster than the company average, and we expect them to be good contributors to our growth and profitability going forward. You'll see us to continue to create shareholder value in this way. So we're focused on accelerating our long-term growth and strengthening our industry leadership by deploying our cash flow, and by putting our balance sheet to work.", "Now I'll switch gears a little, to highlight through a couple of examples, one of our key growth themes within the company. These themes are important because they collectively drive our revenue growth, they underscore our unique depth of capabilities and they illustrate how we fulfill our company's mission: To enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.", "Last quarter, I talked about the great progress we're making to expand in emerging markets, specifically, China. Today, I want to talk about our capabilities into moving Advanced Technologies from the lab to the line and to the field. Specifically, I'll give you three examples from our Laboratory Equipment and Analytical Instruments businesses.", "First, let's look at a part of our Lab Equipment business that you might not know much about: chillers and temperature control devices. We're a leader in this technology, and our Thermo Scientific chillers are found in laboratories around the world. As background, our most advanced chillers can maintain temperature to within 1/1000 of a degree. That's important because maintaining a constant temperature is a key factor in ensuring the reproducibility of certain experiments. To our ongoing technology developments, the applications for temperature control are increasingly moving out of the laboratory and into new applications. One example is a California-based manufacturer, who was working on developing a DNA sequencer. Precise temperature control is critical to DNA sequencing, because the unwinding and reformation of the DNA strands happens at specific temperatures. The customer called on us to help with the challenge. Working closely with them to apply our temperature control expertise, we were able to not only meet this need, but also introduce a whole new line of chillers that are now sold throughout the world. This kind of partnering innovation is actually quite common for us and typically opens the door to even greater opportunities.", "Another example that you're probably familiar with, is our offering of Thermo Scientific handheld technologies within our Analytical Instruments business. Through both new product development and complementary acquisitions, such as Ahura Scientific, we continue to translate lab-proven analytical technologies into handheld instruments for a range of new applications in the field.", "You'll find our XRF Raman spectroscopy, our new infrared instruments using a broad range of applications including pharmaceutical quality control, detection of counterfeit drugs, consumer products screening, airport security and minor safety, to name a few.", "The third example to carry out this theme is also from our Analytical Instruments business. Today, gas chromotography is a standard process control instrument. While we have often heard from our customers in the chemical and steel industries that they need faster, more sensitive and more cost-effective GC technology. Interestingly, this need also extends to the biotech industry, where these instruments are used in the fermentation process. Based on our industry-leading mass spec capability, we recently introduced a new product called Prima PRO, which is a next-generation mass spec analyzer for industrial markets. The Prima PRO provides lower cost of ownership, lower capital costs while improving process control for many applications that were traditionally based on GC analysis.", "To sum it all up, this important theme in our company, lab-to-line-to-field, covers many applications that allows us to drive incremental growth. With industrial end markets clearly improving, we see this as a terrific opportunity well into the future. So this is one theme that illustrates for you how our company is positioned for growth. I plan to highlight one top-level message like this every quarter to give you a better sense of the range of opportunities we are capitalizing on at Thermo Fisher.", "Before I conclude, let me spend a moment on our annual guidance, which you saw in our press release. Pete will go into more detail during his remarks. But at a high level, I can tell you that we're pleased to raise both our adjusted EPS and revenue guidance. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance for 2010 to a new range of $3.47 to $3.53, which would result in 14% to 16% EPS growth over 2009.", "This will be driven by top line growth, strong operating execution and productivity improvements, as well as the benefits of our continued strategy of effectively deploying our capital. We are also raising our 2010 revenue guidance to a new range of $10.72 billion to $10.80 billion. This would result in 6% to 7% overall revenue growth over 2009. We have a strong nine months behind us, with higher top and bottom line expectations than when we started the year.", "Before I hand the call over to Pete, let me summarize by saying that we're on track to deliver a great 2010. I am proud of how well our teams are executing on their plans. We expect good top line growth. Our markets are continuing to show improvement over 2009, and we continue to effectively deploy capital to create shareholder value. In total, this positions us well to achieve our 2010 financial goals.", "Now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. As Marc", "highlighted, we delivered another strong quarter with 15% growth in our adjusted earnings per share through a third quarter record of $0.90 compared to $0.78 last year. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.66, up 25% from $0.53 in the prior year's quarter, primarily as a result of our improved operating performance.", "Moving onto our top line performance. We reported a 6% increase in revenues year-over-year to $2.68 billion. Acquisitions contributed 3% of the growth, and the unfavorable effect of currency translation lowered revenues by 1%, resulting in 4% organic growth. In the quarter, the Biosite transition and unfavorable flu comps that we previously discussed, negatively affected our organic growth by over two percentage points. Excluding these two items, our organic growth would have been above 6%.", "Our results in Q3 continued our trend of strong growth across our portfolio. With Instruments and Equipment as well as Services growing in the high-single digits, sales of consumables were significantly affected by flu and Biosite, but still grew in the low-single digits.", "Bookings in the quarter were essentially in line with revenues. By segment, Analytical Technologies' Q3 revenues grew 14% on a reported basis and 8% organically. This quarter, we saw a specially strong growth in our Mass Spec, Clinical Diagnostics and Biosciences businesses. And our Instruments businesses serving industrial markets, delivered strong year-over-year growth, reflecting the improvement we are seeing in those markets.", "Our Microbiology business however, was dilutive to growth due to the top year-over-year comparison with unusually high H1N1-related flu sales in 2009. In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q3 revenues grew 1% on a reported basis and 2% organically. In the quarter, we saw a strong growth in laboratory equipment and consumables, partially offset by flu and Biosite.", "By geography, our three major regions, North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, all grew organically at about the company average. Bookings were much stronger than revenues in the Asia-Pac region, particularly in China and India, where we had double-digit growth. Rest of the world grew in the mid-20s from a relatively small base, driven by South America and the Middle East. We also had solid results at the bottom line, with Q3 adjusted operating income increasing 8% year-over-year to $471 million.", "Adjusted operating margin was 17.6%, up 30 basis points from 17.3% in the year ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by pull-through on organic volume growth at marginal rates and strong cost productivity driven by our global sourcing, practical process improvement and restructuring initiatives. We also saw a nice accretion in the quarter from our recent acquisitions. These gains were partially offset by strategic growth investments as Marc highlighted, in R&D and commercial resources to support growth, primarily in Asia.", "By segment, Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased by 23% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 21.5%, up 160 basis points versus 19.9% last year, driven by strong pull-through on organic volume growth. Q3 adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services decreased by 6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 13.4%, down 100 basis points versus 14.4% in the 2009 quarter. In this segment, solid productivity was more than offset by increased year-over-year strategic growth investments and some unfavorable geographic and product mix.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 42.2% in Q3, up 100 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This increase was driven by pull-through on organic revenue growth cost productivity and accretion from our recent acquisitions. Adjusted SG&A was 22% of revenue in Q3, up 50 basis points from 21.5% in the year-ago quarter, driven by strategic growth investments. R&D expense was 2.7% of revenue in Q3, up $11 million or 30 basis points from last year, reflecting our commitment to increase investment in technology development to expand our new product pipeline for future growth.", "Moving below the line, our Q3 adjusted net interest expense decreased $11 million year-over-year to $16 million, driven by lower interest expense, mainly as a result of our debt refinancing initiatives. We also had higher year-over-year interest income due to slightly higher interest rates earned on our cash balances.", "Adjusted other income was a gain of $2 million, up $1 million from last year. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.4%, up 40 basis points from Q3 2009 and down 110 basis points from Q2. Our Q3 rate is down from our previous forecast as a result of some specific tax planning benefits that were realized in the quarter. Our new full year adjusted tax rate forecast is 21.2%, which represents our previous estimate of 21.5%, adjusted for the Q3 specific items. This forecast may improve somewhat, depending on whether or not the U.S. R&D tax credit is extended.", "With regard to the new U.S. tax legislation that was approved earlier in the third quarter, the detailed regulations have not yet been issued. So we don't know exactly how they will affect us. However, we're not forecasting any impact on our 2010 tax rate, and we don't expect our 2011 tax rate to be materially outside the assumption we gave you at our May analyst meeting, which was 22% to 23%. As Marc mentioned, we used $475 million of our cash to buy back 10.1 million shares during the quarter. Year-to-date, through the end of the quarter, we spent $663 million on buybacks against our total authorization of $1.5 billion. So we have $837 million left to spend on our current authorizations through September 8, 2011.", "Average diluted shares were $404 million in the quarter, down $16 million from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 share buyback program as well as the redemption of a significant portion of our convertible debt. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet, and we're pleased to report that our cash flow performance accelerated this quarter.", "Q3 year-to-date free cash flow from continuing operations was $891 million, after deducting net capital expenditures of $169 million. We ended the quarter with $939 million in cash and investments, down $377 million from Q2, as free cash flow in the quarter was more than offset by cash used for share buybacks and the Fermentas acquisition.", "Our total debt was $2.16 billion, up slightly from Q2. With regard to working capital, we continue to have good year-over-year performance. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 52 days, down one day from the prior year. And inventory days of supply were 70 days, also down one day from 2009.", "Moving on to our 2010 guidance, we are raising our previous adjusted EPS guidance and tightening the range, resulting in a $0.05 increase to the midpoint. Specifically, we're increasing our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $3.47 to $3.53 from our previous range of $3.40 to $3.50. This new range represents 14% to 16% growth compared to our 2009 adjusted EPS of $3.05.", "The primary drivers of the increase to adjusted EPS guidance are higher revenues, increased capital deployment through share buybacks and a slightly lower tax rate.", "In terms of revenue, we're also raising our guidance to a new range of $10.72 billion to $10.80 billion, up from our previous range of $10.60 billion to $10.75 billion. This narrower range results in an $85 million increase of the midpoint of our previous guidance and represents growth of 6% to 7% compared to our 2009 revenues of $10.11 billion. The primary drivers of the revenue guidance increase are improved foreign currency translation and slightly better-than-expected organic growth in Q3.", "In terms of full organic revenues, our current guidance translates to growth of 4% to 5%. As I've mentioned before, we expect flu and Biosite to negatively impact our full year revenue growth by over 1%. So excluding these two items, our full year organic growth would be solidly in the range of 5% to 6%. As a reminder, Q1 had four more days than the prior year, and Q4 will have four less days. So in terms of our Q4 organic growth, when you combine the calendar impact with the flu and Biosite headwinds, our Q4 reported growth will take a hit of about six percentage points, resulting in reported organic growth of negative 3% to negative 1%. If you adjust out these headwinds, our organic growth guidance for Q4 would be positive 3% to 5%. As usual, our guidance does not include any significant assumptions with regard to future uses of capital other than our previously announced share buyback authorizations, which we expect to utilize over the remaining months of the authorization.", "In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the rest of 2010 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend primarily on the relative strength of our markets for the remainder of the year.", "So to wrap it up, we delivered another strong quarter and are pleased to see continued positive momentum across the company. After consistently delivering three quarters of strong operating performance, we're well positioned to achieve our full-year 2010 financial goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from the line Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So last quarter, we left off with a number of moving parts. And from an end market perspective, we had a little bit of, I would say, noise in some of the specific pieces. As we look at the numbers here, they're quite good across the board. I mean, as we look sequentially, where do you think the biggest deltas where in terms of either end market or product group? However way you want to cut it in terms of improvement or any sort of meaningful change from what we saw previously?", "Marc Casper", "So Ross, maybe what I'll do here is just give you a recap of what we saw in the end markets. And I'll provide some color what happened quarter-over-quarter. So let me start with pharma and biotech. From that set of customers, we continue to grow our share with the biopharma customers. And that's really driven by our compelling value proposition. In the quarter, we had really strong performance in our Bioprocess Production business, where our single-use technology and media are benefiting from the trend of more biologically based drugs. And that customer set really share gain continues for us. Academic and government, really good momentum for us with our Biosciences business. Stimulus was good for us in the quarter. We captured about $15 million of stimulus in the quarter. So we're getting good growth out of academic and government customers as well. In terms of industrial and applied markets, we're definitely seeing the positive impact of the improving economy across our businesses. And in the quarter, really nice strength in our Instrument businesses and in important applied markets such as food and water quality. And these markets are really driving broad-based strength, so continuing improving economy for us in industrial. And then healthcare for us, great momentum in Clinical Diagnostics. We're delivering excellent results there where we're a leading reagent supplier. And that'll get even better for us as the Brahms business is not yet in the organic growth calculations. So that's a business that's doing very well in healthcare. And then healthcare, the one thing is that a reminder, which is flu and Biosite affects those customer base. And when you take that out, just to get a sense of what's happening, actually, that business healthcare as a customers set is growing right at the historical rates and right at the company average. So these specific headwinds that are temporary in healthcare but all four of our customer sets did well in the quarter.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "On the capital deployment front, you guys have done a good job this year in terms of balancing between M&A and share repurchase. The stock continues to be inexpensive. You expect quite a bit on the quarter on the repo side. As you think about M&A landscape now, financing is still relatively cheap, what kind of deal activity are we seeing, or level of sort of availability, both in sort of the public and private market? Or any kind of commentary you can give on what you're  seeing there?", "Marc Casper", "There's a good pipeline of M&A that we're looking at. We always have a deep pipeline, and I think the important thing is pretty clear, were very disciplined. We are doing deals that we're excited about. We've built three platforms over the past year, in terms of specialty diagnostics, biosciences and handhelds. And when we see the right ones, we'll do them. And if we don't like the economics and shareholder value creation, obviously, we'll pass on those that we're not comfortable with, but a good pipeline of M&A.", "Operator", "My next question comes from the line Amit Bhalla  from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "First on Lab Products. Is there a way for you to just talk about the impact from the weak flu season the weak doctor visits? How that's impacting your Lab Products business right now?", "Marc Casper", "Well specifically, the Laboratory Products and Services segment was impacted by about 3% on the top line from the flu and biocide comparisons in the prior year. So if you adjust the 2% organic growth, by the 3%, they would actually have been reporting 5% organic growth in the quarter.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "The flu season is still weak right now, so I'm taking biocide and flu from last year out of the way. But doc visits are also still down. Are you seeing that impacting your business right now also?", "Marc Casper", "Our business has been quite strong and growing at historical levels. I think part of it is that our Clinical Diagnostics business is really gaining share. We are a very high-market share provider of immunoassays. And basically, a number of the large OEM companies have been outsourcing more of their business to us and driving more of our products. So that business is doing well. We've great quality. So we haven't seen the effects of things that other companies have talked about. Our end demand has been strong.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Looking at next year, can you just talk about your comfort with low- to mid-teens earnings guidance as we stand today? And what kind of impact the changing foreign exchange landscape would have on revenue's earnings for next year?", "Marc Casper", "If you think about 2011, at this point in the year, we continue to be comfortable with 2011 operating assumptions that we outlined for you back in May at the analyst meeting. And we'll provide all the details on our next earnings call in the first week of February in terms of guidance, but the operating assumptions we laid out, we feel good about.", "Peter Wilver", "And then in terms of FX, it's hard to predict, obviously, what the FX rates will be by the time we get to the end of the year. But versus the numbers that we talked about back in May, we're probably in the range of something north of $100 million on the top line, in terms of incremental FX if we stay where we are today. And that pulls through at about our average margins of about $20 million a margin or $0.04 to $0.05 on the bottom line.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Could you maybe dive in a little bit more into the Lab Products and Services' margin? I know you mentioned a number of strategic investments, I think, particularly in Asia, but maybe just talk a little bit more about where you're investing the money and this kind of that margin that decline there?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. Out to the -- where we're investing, and Pete may cover a little more commentary, in terms of investments, we are investing significantly in emerging markets to expand our presence. Obviously, with Lab Products being a little bit more than half the company's revenue as we expand in these new markets, they're going to pick up about half of the cost because we have a company-wide commercial strategy. So expansions in China, expansions in Brazil and so forth around the world are part of the expense. And we have some interesting investments that were making on the IT front to strengthen our web capabilities for our customers. That is a good growth driver and ultimately, an efficiency play down the road. Those are probably the biggest cost that we're investing in. That covers it, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And then if you can, Pete, just so I'm clear, when you're talking about biocide, is that pure biocide? When you do the adjustment? Or is that also reflecting the other supplier that you brought into trying to offset some of those? Is that a net number or is that just a gross number with a math side? Just so I'm clear.", "Peter Wilver", "No, that's the net number. So we're offsetting the incremental revenues that we picked up from the new supplier in those adjustments.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist from Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Marc, you just made a comment about the Analytical Instruments business doing even better sequentially. Would love to get a better sense of exactly what's driving that. What's doing better? And is that something that you see being sustainable over the next several quarters?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of what's getting better, we're seeing the effects of the improving industrial economy. That's clear and that covers -- that impacts a broad range of our instruments. Process and Environmental Instruments, where they're more heavily biased towards industrial customers, obviously, we're seeing accelerating growth. But in our largest business, which is Scientific Instruments in the Lab, you're seeing great strength in spectroscopy tools, great strength across mass spec that industrial customers are spending more money on instrumentation right now. It's really very, very positive.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "On the LPS investments, just as you think historically when you make these kind of investments, will we start to see leverage on these investments? Is that a 2011 dynamic? What's the timeframe we should be thinking there?", "Marc Casper", "I think, and I said this a number of times, we increased some expenditure rates in terms of taking a lower overall margin expansion for this full year. But our expectation is not to ramp up on this level but rather, get leverage going forward. So 2010 was a \"put some more money into commercial, put some more money into R&D.\" And then we get the benefits of the company continues to drive strong revenue growth. Those investments get leveraged over that bigger base. So we're very clear on what the investment strategy is. And there's this great opportunities in '10 that were taking advantage of.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "You guys are the second company this week to talk about strong media sales to BioPharma. I think we've also heard from a couple of players that mass spec sales have been picking up in Pharma. Recognizing that you guys have been a share gainer in this market for a bit of a while now, separate from that, are you actually seeing that the demand dynamics in BioPharma are actually improving?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. When you look at the quarter for us, we had good performance in our BioPharma customers. And if I look at it -- it's not dramatically different than what we've seen earlier in the year, but our performance is good and clearly our bioprocess production has done well. Obviously, we've had great momentum for long, long periods of time in mass specs, so that's a customer base that is always kind of growing where we expected it to grow.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then the M&A in the quarter, I think you guys mentioned that, that's tracking ahead of plans. Certainly, ahead of what I had in my model. I think you did about $80 million in M&A-related revenue in the quarter. I mean, is that a good -- that's going to turn into organic but I guess I guess it's essentially, as we think about that number, is that kind of a run rate number that we should be using? $80-plus million per quarter growing at a rate that's above the corporate average as we look ahead? Is that the right way to think about the deals that you've done this year? And how we think about those moving forward?", "Peter Wilver", "It's obviously hard for us to predict, going forward, what the acquisitions will be. But I would say, this quarter, we picked up 3% from acquisitions and divestitures. That's on the high-end of what we would generally see in the quarter. So it's more in the range of 2%. Of course, we don't target that number. And again, it depends on what acquisitions we actually compete. But I would say, the 3% is more on the high end.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Yes, I'm sorry. I actually meant -- given that the acquisitions that you've actually done at this point seems to be tracking ahead of plan. I mean, is this the type of growth that we should expect from these businesses as they roll into the organic number next year?", "Marc Casper", "You should assume on that base of business, that those businesses are going to be growing faster than the company average. The three platforms, which is the absolute vast majority of the revenue are all very attractive end markets. And we've added a lot of value to those businesses in terms of being able to drive revenues synergies. So those are going to be good growers for us. I think you done the math right in terms of what the size of the businesses are, and then you can just factor in above average growth rates for them.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from LS.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "A little bit on that last question, I've not really gazed but Marc, can you talk about early revenue synergies you been able to drive from your new qPCR businesses?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. I think, when you think about what we've done in qPCR, and you look at it, it's a business that has one player with very high share. We have a channel and relationships from all of those customers because they buy enormous volumes of product from us. Not even just the company or the resource lab, but actually the individuals that are using those products are our customers. What we decided is to develop some of our own products, and you've seen those actually launched some specific reagents in the field. We brought Finnzymes, which brought an interesting instrument technology. We brought Fermentas, which expands out our offering. So we have a clear view that, leveraging our channel strength, we're able to put together both organically and inorganically, a nice position to pick up share in the market. It's not huge today, but we think it will be a nice growth opportunity for us down the road.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "You mentioned you're gaining share in diagnostics based on some OEM business with larger manufacturers. What's the value proposition? And I guess, what's really behind that share gain, is it a lower cost? Or is there something special you guys could do that isn't easy for other folks to do?", "Marc Casper", "I think we have two aspects of those relationships. One, is we have a lot of proprietary content, meaning that it's our capability that is exclusively ours, and we effectively -- if they want to have that product on their analyze, is they have to come to us. And we've built such a large business over time that way, that they've actually given us some of their own contents that you know, you guys are a world-class manufacturer, great quality, great on-time delivery. We're shutting down plants on ours but our customers, and we're going to move our volume to you. Because not only do we want your proprietary technology, but we'll even give you some of our own to manufacture for us. And we're just doing a great job with it, and it's this great customer service, great relationships. And it basically means that you find our reagents in every clinical diagnostics central lab, because we have great share with all of the major OEM players.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Marc, looking at the Scientific Board that you just performed, looks like a lot of emphasis on sub biologists, oncologists and pathologists. Is that a kind of suggestive of your kind of long-term R&D plans? And talk a little bit about what you envision for the Board?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So when you look at the company, there isn't somebody in mass spec that isn't interacting with us, or knows about us or we have access to. Right? I mean, the company has got this incredible aura around it in mass spectrometry. And we also have incredibly strong businesses, one of the largest in cancer diagnostics, with our Anatomical Pathology business. We have a huge presence in terms of dealing with our genomics customers with a broad range of capabilities. But the company is a little less known for those two things, and we put a heavier weighting on our Scientific Advisory Board. Getting the best minds in the field to interact with us. We'll learn from it, but it sends a signal to the broader customer base of our commitment to building out our capabilities there.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then Pete, just as we look out to 2011, and forecasting that -- Any days issues that we need to be thinking about when modeling the quarters?", "Peter Wilver", "I'm very happy to say, no.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Marc, on the industrial market side, clearly, the later cycle franchises like yours are still accelerating, but the rate of improvement and kind of the capacity utilization metrics have slowed quite a bit recently. So my question is, how much longer is there this catch-up investment phase in the industrial markets? When do those markets start to basically track GDP again?", "Marc Casper", "So there are obviously, macroeconomist that are probably better-equipped to get the best answer. Our read is, just looking at the way bookings are shaping up in those parts of the business, that we're going to continue to see acceleration of that business. I mean, the trend is, we're seeing order rates increasing there, so we're not seeing signs of a slowdown. It's really hard to know when an inflection point goes in the opposite direction. We're not seeing any leading indicators in that part of the business to see a slowdown. And our short cycle businesses, are continuing to strengthen. So things like handheld, which are not big capital decisions for customers, both businesses are just doing incredibly well. So we're not seeing the signs. We read all the information. We pay attention to it but right now, we're seeing the benefits of an improving economy.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then Pete, could you just provide some clarity around the top 20 trends in the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of top 20, they continue to grow at above the average growth rate for us. So we continue to do well there.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "With regard to kind of the incremental investments you're making here in the SG&A line, it looks like, I assume now, had about four quarters between $580 million to $600 million. Is this kind of a good run rate to model going forward? Or should we assume that there's a period of investment here in Asia that will maybe wear off a little bit in the next couple years?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. I would say, we've been ramping up these investments throughout the year, and the investments will continue to ramp up in Q4. Mostly because we've put people in, this is mostly people. We put people in throughout the third quarter, so we'll get the full impact of those investments in the fourth quarter. But as Marc said earlier, we're not expecting to continue this ramp, it's more invest this year and then maintain that higher level of spending in 2011 and leverage that against higher revenues.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then I guess with regards to Asia, I think in your comments, Pete, you talked about all geographies kind of growing at the corporate average. I think, subsequently, you said, double-digit growth in China and India. But as we think about Asia, going forward, is there an opportunity to grow that above the corporate growth rate? Or are the areas that are kind of weighing down the overall average there?", "Marc Casper", "So Tycho, when you look going forward in Asia, we see that as going to be the fastest-growing geography for us. Obviously, you have very different dynamics by country. China, India versus Japan and so forth. But the whole region, we still see as an above average growth for us. The bookings momentum there is obviously very strong and encouraging as a leading indicator for what the future holds.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On the stepped-up R&D, you highlighted some of the diagnostic products that have come out of that effort. Can you talk to some of the investments you're making maybe in other areas? Or how we should think about new products emerging from the stepped-up R&D investment, outside of the Diagnostic business?", "Marc Casper", "I think, what you've got a sense of the call in my prepared remarks -- is I wanted to try to provide some clarity on businesses that are important growth drivers that we don't talk as much about. Because our Instrument businesses are well understood. So I spend more time talking about lab to line than talk more about Diagnostics. We have increased our R&D and Biosciences. We've increased our R&D in our Scientific Instruments as well. You'll see new applications and new technologies and mass spec coming out. You'll see more reagents on Biosciences coming out, that we think are good growth opportunities for the company going forward. So it's not just the ones I mentioned, but I think you'll see nice benefits in our growth from R&D.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Could you maybe comment a little bit on the pricing environment that you're seeing for equipment? And maybe comment if you see any discernible differences between high-end products like your mass spectrometers and then maybe the lower-end products?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of the pricing environment, Isaac, at the beginning of the year, we said, typically, in a year we are coming in the beginning of a recovery, that you get lower than average price increases. We handicapped the year as an assumption of 1% to 1.5%. When you look at it to the first nine months, we're just under to 1%. So we're pretty much right where we thought it would play out. In terms of the various competitive dynamics, the highest in instrument pricing has been strong. In areas that there's more competitors, obviously, there's more price intensity. But it's pretty much playing out as we expect, coming in at the lower end of the range that we articulated at the beginning of the year.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And then just maybe, secondly, understanding that it's an uncertain political environment and nice funding growth, could you maybe share with us any thoughts you have on your assumptions for NIH funding over the next couple of years? And then maybe how that might contrast with your outlook for funding in the EU regions?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. When we are thinking about NIH funding, holding aside that there'll be a little bit of stimulus that drops in and falls into a lab and -- probably not a lab but a little bit, we're assuming pretty flat budgets. Where, as opposed to some of the U.S. government cutting budgets and departments, we're looking at NIH being relatively stable, is our basic assumption. And when you look at kind of EU academic funding, we view that as kind of country-specific. Obviously, UK is going to be relatively stable and probably see some growth in some of the other markets.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line Paul Knight from CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Marc, can you talk about pharmaceutical demand in Europe in the quarter? And then Pete, the tax rate, what do you expect that to be in the future? And is it trending down or where is the trend on that tax rate?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of the pharma demand by geography, I can answer the question more on what are we seeing in the geography in Europe than all of the specific sub-segments. In Europe, we had a good quarter. In terms of growth, they grew at the company average. The strongest customer set in Europe was industrial for us. And I haven't -- by each and every customer type. But as I look at it, we had growth of the rates -- the company average and industrial was a little bit faster than the average.", "Peter Wilver", "And then in terms of the tax rate, as I mentioned, back in May, we talked about a tax rate in the range of 22% to 23% for 2011. That's a slight increase from where we had previously forecasted 2010 to be, with the primarily difference being as we make more income, it tends to come in marginal rates. So just the weighted average tends to go up as we make more money. The other nuance that's obviously happened since May, is the new tax legislation. At this point, we don't know specifically how that's going to impact us. But we don't feel we're going to be outside the range of what we talked about in May, which was that 22% to 23%.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And that legislation goes to the tax credit. That would have benefit you through how long? All in next year?", "Peter Wilver", "It's actually a detriment to us, but we believe that we have some tax planning initiatives to help mitigate the impact of the change. Oh, I'm sorry, were you talking about the R&D tax credit?", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Yes.", "Peter Wilver", "The R&D tax credit, it depends on how they approve it. But generally, they only do it for one year. So right now, it will only impact us for 2010. If it gets extended in 2011, obviously, we would see a similar benefit.", "Operator", "And my next question comes from the line Tony Butler from Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Staying with the topic of pricing. Are there any shortages of components, source components, that you've witnessed? And moreover, is there any inflation to price on any source components? And the second question, dropped margins in the LPS business, I recognized they're down 100 basis points year-over-year. You're down sequentially by 80, while biocide and perhaps flu could be components, the question is, what might one think about a normalized run rate about margins in that business? And would you care to provide any aspirational goals throughout margins in LPS?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. First of all, in terms of the shortages, no. We're not seeing any shortages from our suppliers. So we have a good supply base for an important customer. So we haven't had any supply interruptions to our business, Tony.", "Peter Wilver", "So when you look at Laboratory Products and Services, operating performance, it's really comparable to ATS. They are investing, as a percentage of revenue, at the same level, essentially, as Analytical Technologies. But obviously, in the quarter, they're getting hit harder by the flu and biocide headwinds. And obviously, they don't get the same pull-through on incremental revenues that the Analytical Technologies business gets. So those factors are really causing the decline. So in the end, it's really the investments as its compared to the incremental pull-through on revenues between the two segments. In terms of going forward, going into Q4, we certainly expect sequential margin improvement in both segments, regardless of the investment level that we're going to have. And I don't believe we've talked really going forward long-term about margins by the segments. But certainly, for the company, we're looking at 50 to 100 basis points of margin expansion a year. And nothing has really changed in those assumptions since we talked about it back in May.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Marc, just back on sourcing. Are prices being added or using inflation in pricing for you on components?", "Marc Casper", "On things that have value add -- so components, the answer is no. We've had very stable pricing. We've seen some commodity price increases, not large at all. And our global sourcing efforts have more than materialized.  So this has not been a negative factor, very normal environment. Steel was up for a little bit. You read the papers today, it's going back down. So inflation has been pretty much under check, and we're pretty sophisticated on anybody who has any value add to what they supply to us in terms of being able to control any types of price increases passed on to us.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Gleacher.", "Sung Ji Nam - JPMorgan", "Just quickly, for your mass spec business, I was just curious as to do you have a sense of what the base line growth expectation might be for next year? Is it mid single-digits or high single-digits?", "Marc Casper", "We really don't give the expectations down at the product line level. But it gets blended into the company rates, but it's clearly going to grow at above the company's average rate. It's a great market, we have leading technology, leading position, great suite of new introductions, May coming out. We're doing well on mass spec, and I'm excited about our prospects.", "Sung Ji Nam - JPMorgan", "And then going back to the stimulus, the impact you had this quarter, $15 million. Was it largely U.S.-based?", "Peter Wilver", "In this quarter, it was U.S.-based.", "Sung Ji Nam - JPMorgan", "And just going forward, do you have insight into other potential stimulus programs out there that might be meaningful?", "Marc Casper", "So when we gave the original $100 million to $200 million of guidance on stimulus at the beginning of '09, we we're right in that range. We had $140-something million at this point in time, see some continuation. The only big unknown, which would be a potential positive, but it's hard to tell, Japan has just outlined a high-level, big stimulus program. But it hasn't yet got to, \"What does it mean for our industry?\" So that's a potential positive out there, but too early to tell.", "Operator", "And the final question comes from the line Derik De Bruin from UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So I guess, when you just -- a little bit of clarity on modeling. So when you kind of look at the Q4, I've assumed that the extra days are going to have a bigger impact on the LPS business, on the Analytical Technologies business, modeling purposes, just given the consumable mix.", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, that's true.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And I guess, also on the AT, what are you guys giving any feeling in terms of potential for a budget flush this year? I mean, it wasn't much of one last year. You getting any sense there might be a little bit of relief spending in the industry?", "Marc Casper", "Derik, that one's hard to call. So we're assuming a normal year end, is the way to characterize it. We didn't bake into an assumption a budget flush. So if it doesn't happen, it's not going to be an adverse. And if customers loosen up at the end of the year, that would obviously be an incremental positive. So I don't see a lot of downside from that. We've kind looked at normal activity.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So you guys are a huge player in the air quality monitoring market. And if I recall correctly, you had a good launch initially with your mercury monitoring and that got kind of stymied by the last administration. And clearly, regulations around the world on monitoring, and also certainly, for mercury and other things that's picked up -- and I guess clearly also, some of the investor [ph] is also tied to air monitoring, I guess, is there still upside from just that continuation of the mercury monitoring program? And I guess, how do you kind of look at this market in terms of just the impact of environmental regulation on the business?", "Marc Casper", "So we like new environmental regulations. I mean, that's good news for our business. Every time China, the U.S., India puts another restriction on things from an emissions standpoint, that's good, given our very strong market position. So we had lots of growth that came out of mercury. We got high share regulation change that slowed it down. The technology is relevant. Were pretty confident, and you'll actually see a reemergence of that technology in some other countries over time. Anytime that we have greenhouse gas monitoring requirements even if it's just regulated by the EPA, not even if it's driven by the Senate, that would use our monitors to drive growth. And I think you'll start hearing from us, we've talked a little bit about it, but I think you'll hear from us in the next quarter, to talking about some minor safety applications of those technologies where we have some incredible capabilities in particulate monitoring that we think is a very nice growth opportunity going to '11 and '12 for us. So there's a lot of good things on the air quality front. And that's, in a certain respect, a later cycle business and therefore, I think, good news to come down the road.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "I recall correctly, you guys do have an overwhelming share in that general market?", "Marc Casper", "We have a very, very high share in the U.S. A very, very high share in China, and a good global presence, yes.", "Marc Casper", "So let me close saying we have excellent results in Q3, on the heels of a very strong first half. And that gives us an even more positive outlook for the full year as evidenced by our increased EPS and revenue guidance. So we feel that we're are not only well-positioned to achieve our 2010 goals, but we're also confident in our ability sustain growth into 2011. I look forward to reporting out the year-end results in February, as well as our guidance for the coming year.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations, until March 4, 2011. A copy of the press release of our fourth quarter 2010 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our recap of the 2010 fourth quarter and full year. On the call, we also look forward to outlining our guidance for 2011.", "Let me start by saying that I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our growth goals for the year. We outlined our key objectives back in May at our Analyst Meeting, all in support of our primary goal, to accelerate EPS growth.", "As you saw in our press release, we delivered record adjusted EPS in 2010, exceeding the high end of our annual guidance by $0.04. We executed well on our operating plans while continuing to make the strategic investments and technology development in emerging markets that we believe will contribute to an even stronger future for Thermo Fisher. This combination, in addition to our ability to deploy capital, gives us a competitive advantage and reinforces our position as the industry leader. We expect to continue our trend of delivering excellent EPS growth, as you can see in our 2011 guidance, which I'll cover later in my remarks.", "Before I discuss our performance for the full year in more detail, let me touch on the highlights of the fourth quarter. We reported record adjusted EPS in the quarter with a 10% increase to $1 per share. We generated good adjusted operating margin expansion coming in at 40 basis points improvement to 18.4%.", "I'm also pleased to report that we had strong double-digit growth in Q4 in China and India. In fact, in the quarter, China became our third largest country in terms of revenue behind the U.S. and Germany. We also saw continued strengthening of industrial markets in the quarter and delivered strong growth in applied markets such as environmental and food safety. ", "Turning to the year in a bit more detail, adjusted earnings per share grew 17% to a record $3.57, versus $3.05 in 2009. As I did last quarter, I'd like to focus on the three key drivers of our 2010 EPS performance. One is top line revenue growth, the second is operational excellence and the third is disciplined capital deployment.", "So first, let me cover the top line revenue growth. Revenues for the year grew 7% to $10.8 billion compared with $10.1 billion a year ago. In our Analytical Technologies segment, our Scientific and Process Instruments businesses benefited particularly from strength in applied markets and the global industrial recovery. Our new products in molecular spectroscopy and handheld instruments really hit the mark with rapid adoption by our customers for QA/QC testing and security screening applications.", "I'll talk in a few moments about how the new food safety bill in the U.S. and increased awareness globally should create further growth opportunities for us as a result of the need for better testing. Sales of our clinical diagnostic products within the segment remained strong throughout the year, including our biomarker test kits, which came with the B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisition. In our Lab Products and Services segment, we had solid contributions from both our Equipment and Consumables businesses in 2010, highlighted by some key wins from major university customers.", "One final comment on our revenue growth overall. It was nice to see strong contributions again this year from our largest customer accounts, which continue to grow faster than the company average. We have demonstrated this level of performance at these accounts since the merger four years ago. Our approach here actually applies to a much broader set of customers. So going forward, we'll talk more about the value proposition in that context. ", "Our second EPS growth driver is operational excellence. And that continues to give us the advantage of fully leveraging our revenue growth to deliver excellent bottom line results. Our teams were determined to achieve their goals in 2010 and their solid execution of our operating plans made it possible. I'm extremely proud of their accomplishments, and let me give you a few highlights. ", "First, we increased the use of PPI and PPI Lean tools to improve our processes and productivity and strengthen our global competitive position. Second, continuing to rationalize our global footprint by completing a number of facility consolidations during the year, eight of which were factories. Last, carefully targeting our spending to make investments that will create the most value for our customers.", "We increased our total R&D investment in 2010 by over $40 million or 20 basis points year-over-year to strengthen our leadership position and innovation. Our previous investments led to a number of successful thermoscientific product launches in 2010, including our TSQ Quantum XLS triple quad instrument for environmental and food safety analysis. Our new benchtop GP 1-liter and 3-liter centerpiece platform for greatly improved laboratory productivity, which has done extremely well in helping us gain share. And we also introduced new Consumables and bioreagents for our biotech customers doing cell-based research. ", "Turning to emerging markets, I've already highlighted our strong results in Asia Pacific during the quarter and the year. We continue to invest to expand in this important growth market. Our new China Technology Center, which we opened in August is up and running, and we are well on our way to developing the products geared for the local market. With our broad offerings, our prospects in the region continue to grow, as China's economic focus evolves, from infrastructure to environment to consumer safety to life sciences research. In 2011, we expect to build our presence in other emerging global markets as well, such as in South America. We plan to expand our commercial operations in Brazil, for example, which is now the eighth largest economy in the world.", "Even with these significant investments in R&D and global expansion, we achieved a 12% increase in adjusted operating income year-over-year for 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion. ", "Our third key contributor to EPS growth, effective capital deployment, continues to provide us with multiple avenues for creating shareholder value. In 2010, we deployed a total of $1.6 billion on share buybacks and complementary acquisitions. We significantly stepped up our share buyback program during the year. In fact, we invested just over $1 billion to repurchase nearly 21 million shares. In the fourth quarter alone, we spent $350 million to repurchase almost 7 million of our shares. At the end of the year, we had $488 million remaining under our existing buyback authorization. We also deployed $600 million to complete 11 acquisitions in 2010. These acquisitions added complementary technologies and expanded our presence in attractive markets.", "As you know, in December, we announced our agreement to acquire Dionex for $2.1 billion. It's been over a month since we talked about it, so let me remind you of our rationale for this exciting transaction. Dionex is a leading provider of chromatography systems with a very strong track record of technology innovation. By combining their ion and liquid chromatography capabilities with our existing chromatography offering, we will create an industry-leading chromatography portfolio for our customers. Of course, this will benefit our leading position in mass spectrometry as well and vice versa.", "The technology combination, alone, creates a compelling value proposition. What makes it even more so, is that it strengthens our presence in highly attractive markets. We stand to benefit from Dionex's extensive customer base in applied markets such as environmental, food safety and other industrial sectors. And with more than 35% of their revenues in Asia/Pacific and other emerging geographies, Dionex fits perfectly with our strategy of expansion in these high-growth regions.", "I just visited Sunnyvale a couple of weeks ago to meet with the Dionex employees and management. There's certainly a lot of excitement and enthusiasm about becoming part of Thermo Fisher. I'm pleased to report that the integration planning is well underway. As you know, we cleared U.S. antitrust in early January. ", "In Europe, we're seeking to transfer jurisdiction to the European Commission rather than having to file for regulatory approvals in multiple countries. The timeline in Europe will likely take the closing into early Q2. So we're focused on accelerating our long-term growth and strengthening our industry leadership by deploying our cash flow and by putting our balance sheet to work.", "I'd like to now highlight a key growth theme within the company as I did in Q3. The intent here is to demonstrate how our ongoing investments lead to new growth opportunities for Thermo Fisher by collectively driving our revenue growth, leveraging our unique depth of capabilities across the company and fulfilling our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.", "Last quarter, I talked about moving advanced technologies from the lab to the line and to the field. Today, I want to highlight our opportunities in food safety testing. In light of the new legislation that we passed a month ago in the U.S. This is good news for Thermo Fisher because it will increase the need for testing in an already attractive food safety market. Not only in the U.S., but worldwide. The Food Safety Modernization Act is a step forward in restoring public confidence in the integrity of our food supply. Essentially, it replaces doubt and uncertainty with accountability and testing protocols to ensure that our food, whether domestic or imported, is safe. The median impact us twofold. First, it authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to increase monitoring and auditing processes, access records of food producers and recall tainted products. Second, it enables the FDA to establish procedures to protect our food supplies from terrorists and reduce the likelihood of intentional tampering.", "So what does this mean for us? It means that we can strengthen our position in this growing market by helping our customers comply with the new rules. Thousands of U.S.-based of food production plants registered with the FDA will be required to develop methods to rapidly and effectively track and trace contaminated food to its point of origin. We could help these producers avoid recalls that hurt their profitability and put their brands at risk.", "Our Analytical Instruments business stands to benefit most from the new law, mainly our leading mass spec systems and our chromatography offerings, which will be significantly enhanced by the acquisition of Dionex. More specifically, our turbo flow technologies enable food testing labs to improve productivity by lowering the cost per sample analyzed. We are currently working with the FDA to use this technique to screen for hundreds of pesticide residues simultaneously.", "We have also developed non-targeted screening methods using our extract high-resolution benchtop mass spectrometer. This system brings the power of mass analysis to a price point that enables efficiency in routine analysis. In addition, there will likely be an increase in the use of our hand-held analytical instruments for authenticating packaged food. And new laboratory standards for accreditation will require more robust quality systems, which will present opportunities for our leading LIMS software platform.", "Tracing the origin of food from the farm to the table will produce enormous amounts of data. An automated system for data storage and retrieval will become the standard rather than the exception in many existing labs and production facilities.", "Finally, new microbiology kits and methods will be required for the testing of pathogens in food, creating opportunities for us there as well. With large percentages of the U.S. food supply being imported, there'll, no doubt, be a carryover benefit in other global markets such as Europe, Japan and China.", "As you know, we opened our food safety response center in Germany in April 2010, and we'll continue to use this new resource to develop testing methods in response to food crises around the world. This is a great example of the growth opportunity that we can capitalize on as a result of our leadership position from a technology perspective as well as our market presence around the world. ", "Before I wrap up, let me summarize our annual guidance for 2011, which you saw on our press release. Pete will go into more details over his remarks, including the key assumptions we're factoring in, but I'll review them at a high level.", "We expect to achieve a range of $4 to $4.10 in adjusted EPS for 2011. This would be 12% to 15% growth over our excellent results in 2010. I want to point out that this does not yet include the anticipated accretion from our acquisition of Dionex.", "We expect to achieve 2011 revenues for the full year in the range of $11.33 billion to $11.45 billion. This would lead to 5% to 6% revenue growth over 2010.", "Before I hand the call over to Pete, let me summarize my remarks this morning with a few key points. We successfully executed our plans to deliver a strong 2010. We remain focused on accelerating our adjusted EPS growth. We are well-positioned to deliver on our growth goals for 2011.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we're pleased to report another quarter of strong adjusted earnings per share, with 10% year-over-year growth to a fourth quarter record of $1, compared to $0.91 last year. For the full year, adjusted EPS was a record $3.57, up 17% from $3.05 last year. GAAP EPS in Q4 was $0.75, up 15% from $0.65 in the prior year's quarter. And GAAP EPS for the full year was $2.53, up 26% from $2.01 last year. ", "Moving onto our top-line performance. Q4 reported revenue decreased 2% year-over-year to $2.78 billion. In the quarter, we picked up a 2% benefit from acquisitions and foreign exchange was a negative 1%, resulting in a 3% decline organically. Excluding the flu, Biosite and calendar headwinds that we highlighted on our last quarter's call, our Q4 organic growth was positive 3%, consistent with our expectations.", "Full year reported revenues increased 7% year-over-year to $10.79 billion. For the year, we added 2.5% from acquisitions and FX was essentially flat, so organic revenues grew more than 4%. Excluding flu and Biosite for the full year, organic revenue growth was 6%. We continue to strengthen our backlog with bookings exceeding revenues by 1% in both the quarter and the full year.", "Moving on to the segments. In Analytical Technologies, Q4 revenues grew 4% on a reported basis and 2% organically. We saw a strong growth in our Specialty Diagnostics businesses, including our Biomarker business in the quarter.", "In our Instruments businesses, especially those serving industrial and applied markets continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth. For the full year, Analytical Technologies grew 11% on a reported basis and 6% organically.", "Turning to the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 revenues declined 6% on a reported basis and 5% organically. In the quarter, we say strong growth in our laboratory equipment offset by a decline in consumables related to flu, Biosite and the calendar. For the full year, revenues in Laboratory Products and Services grew 4% on both the reported and organic basis.", "By geography, in Q4, we saw a high-single digit organic growth in Asia Pacific, with both China and India going over 20%. North America and Europe so a mid single-digit declines compared to the prior year. And rest of the world grew in the low-double digits from a relatively small base. For the full year, North America grew in the mid-single digits, Europe in the low-single digits, Asia Pac near 10%, and the rest of the world in the mid-teens.", "Turning to adjusted operating income. We had strong bottom line results with Q4 adjusted operating income of $511 million, up slightly compared to the prior year on lower revenue. Adjusting operating margin was 18.4%, up 40 basis points from 18% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by strong cost productivity from our practical process improvement, global sourcing and restructuring initiatives. And we continued to see nice accretion in the quarter from our recent acquisitions. These gains were partially offset by the investments we're making in R&D and commercial resources to support growth, primarily in Asia.", "For the full year, adjusted operating margin increased to 17.8%, up 80 basis points year-over-year and at the high-end we gave at our Analyst Meeting back in May. This is a significant achievement given the level of investments we funded this year to position the company for future growth.", "By segment, Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased by 6% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 22.2%, up 40 basis points versus 21.8% last year, driven by strong cost productivity and slightly higher pricing. For the full year, Analytical Technologies' adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 21.3%.", "Turning to our Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 adjusted operating income decreased by 5% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, up 10 basis points on the year-ago quarter with strong cost productivity more than offsetting growth investments and lower revenues. For the full year, Laboratory Products and Services' adjusted operating margin increased 20 basis points to 13.9%.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 43.2% in Q4, up 170 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This robust margin expansion was primarily driven by strong cost productivity and the positive impact of our recent acquisitions. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 42.5%, up 140 basis points from 41.1% in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22% of revenue, of 90 basis points from the year-ago quarter. For the full year, it was 22.1%, an increase of 40 basis points primarily as a result of the strategic growth investments and acquisitions. R&D expense was 2.8% of revenue in Q4, up 40 basis points from last year. For the full year, it was 2.7%, an increase of 20 basis points or $40 million, reflecting our commitment to invest in technology development to expand our new product pipeline for future growth.", "Moving below the line. Our Q4 net interest expense decreased $10 million year-over-year to $16 million, driven by lower interest expense as a result of our debt refinancing initiatives. Adjusted other income was a gain of $1 million, up $3 million from last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 19.6%, down 40 basis points from last year and down 190 basis points from our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the U.S. R&D tax credit being extended in December. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 20.7%, up 70 basis points from 2009, primarily as a result of higher income at marginal rates. ", "As Marc mentioned, we used $350 million of our cash to buy back 6.9 million shares during the quarter. And for the full year, we spent slightly more than $1 billion on buybacks against our total authorization of $1.5 billion. So we have $488 million less to spend in our current authorization. Average diluted shares were $399 million in the quarter, down $23 million or 6% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 share buyback program as well as the redemption of $325 million of our convertible debt earlier in the year. For the full year, average diluted shares were $409 million, down $13 million or 3% from 2009.", "We continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver solid cash flow performance this quarter. Full-year free cash flow from continuing ops was $1.24 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $255 million. As expected, this was down about $200 million from 2009, primarily as a result of incremental investment and working capital to support higher revenues and higher capital expenditures partially offset by higher earnings. We ended the quarter with $926 million in cash and investments, down $13 million from Q3 as free cash flow in the quarter was offset by cash use for share buybacks and acquisitions closed during the quarter. Our total debt was $2.14 billion, down slightly from Q3.", "With regard to working capital, we saw a good sequential improvement this quarter. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 49 days, down 3 days sequentially from the previous quarter, and inventory days of supply were 67 days, also down 3 days from Q3.", "Moving on to our guidance for 2011. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $4 to $4.10, which represents 12% to 15% growth over our 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.57. In terms of revenue, we expect to achieve 2011 revenues in the range of $11.33 billion to $11.45 billion, which represents growth of 5% to 6% compared to our 2010 reported revenues of $10.79 billion. This guidance includes about 0.75% growth from completed acquisitions, and it excludes the pending acquisition of Dionex, as well as any other potential future acquisitions or divestitures. It also presumes present foreign currency exchange rates, which would have a favorable impact of about 0.75% on our revenue growth. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates.", "On an organic basis, the midpoint of our revenue guidance represents about 4% growth. Keep in mind that we still have about a percentage point of revenue headwind this year as a result of the Biosite and Japan stimulus revenues we received last year. Both of these occurred in the first half of the year, with the Japan stimulus only affecting Q1. So when you look at the year from a revenue growth perspective, Q1 has a tough comparison, and we expect organic revenues to be essentially flat. For the rest of the year, we should be in the mid-single digit range with accelerating growth as the year progresses. ", "To give you a little more detail on our earnings guidance, we're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 to 80 basis points compared to 2010. Positive contributors to our margin expansion will be: Pull-through on organic revenue growth at marginal rates; PPI and PPI Lean, as well as low cost region manufacturing; global sourcing including low-cost region sourcing; the full year benefit of our restructuring actions in 2010, as well as incremental actions in 2011; and moderate price increases comparable to the environment we experienced in 2010.", "These benefits will be somewhat offset by: Salary increases and other inflation; and the full year impact or run rate of the investments we made in 2010 in a few key strategic areas to strengthen our depth of capabilities and drive future growth; in R&D, to accelerate long-term growth, primarily in our a Mass Spectrometry, Specialty Diagnostics and Biosciences businesses; in selling and marketing, primarily in emerging markets, but also to drive our new product launches; and in information technology, primarily related to e-business. ", "Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be about flat year-over-year. Our adjusted income tax rate is forecasted to be in the range of 21% to 22%, up slightly from 20.7% in 2010, primarily as a result of higher income and marginal rates. And full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million, down 4% to 5% from 2010, which it seems that we'll use the remaining $488 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration on September 8, 2011.", "Finally, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $280 million to $310 million. In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2011 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year.", "So in summary, 2010 was a great year for us, operationally and financially. We successfully delivered our plan and met or exceeded our targets for the year. I believe we're well-positioned to achieve our growth goals in 2011 and I'm excited about our prospects for the long term.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of John Groberg, Macquarie.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Marc, would you mind, obviously in this quarter, there's a lot of noise though with the fewer number of days and some things that you've characterized pretty well, and as you go into next year, Pete has outlined some of the headwinds. Could you just kind of step back and talk, I guess, about just kind of the end markets and kind of compare them how you're seeing them, I guess, today, you have the balance. Then Marc, as you discussed, I do know if you want to talk about them from that perspective. And then maybe kind of your view as you enter into 2011 how you envision these markets performing in 2011 as well? Just give us a sense as to how you actually see these markets, currently, despite a lot of these pluses and minuses that are coming in to your specific results?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. John, as you look at the end markets, let me start with Industrial, and that's clearly a great story. We're seeing the benefit of the gradually improving market throughout the year, and we saw very strong growth in the quarter and for the full year. Organic growth in industrial is well above the company average. For us, we're seeing increased demand for more QA/QC products broadly, particularly benefiting from nice new product launches that we've had in molecular spectroscopy and portable instrumentation to meet the needs of our customers in the industrial applications. Healthcare, which is where you're going to have the most noise in the numbers. If you normalize that for flu and Biosite, growth was in line with the company average, and we continue to do well with our healthcare customers. We're very pleased with how our Clinical Diagnostics business is performing. We're very excited about the performance of B.R.A.H.M.S., which we closed in October of 2009. That business' outlook is very bright and it clearly is -- it was a very good acquisition for us. Obviously, the comps are going to get easier for us in 2011 in Healthcare as we don't have the H1N1 comparison and Biosite will go away in the second half. Academic and Government, pretty consistent throughout the year. We had some very good wins in lab equipment, as our customers are taking advantage of the very broad range of capabilities we have there, so we've done some equipping out of large, new laboratories at major universities. That's been really positive. Probably the only thing I would mention as a reminder is that in the Academic and Government segment, in Q1 of 2010, we had a $50 million set of orders from Japan, in terms of stimulus funds, which will make that a tough comparison. But other than that, we see Academic and Government being pretty stable and consistent. In terms of Biopharma, that was similar throughout the year. Our bioprocess production products continue to do very well, as we're seeing a meaningful transition from a kind of stainless steel manufacturing to a sterile manufacturing environment. That's good for our Media and Disposable Plastics business in particular.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "On revenues, again, for next year, to you Marc, but just to make certain, the acquisitions, the 0.75%, the ones I see primarily for next year are a noble way of prosing-on Fermentas in loan because you're not including Dionex, and all of those, all in, are going to be about 0.75%, is that what you said in terms of 2011?", "Marc Casper", "The specific list is out on our website on our reconciliation package, but yes, the 0.75% is the past acquisitions and divestitures.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Ross Muken, Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So in terms of the operating margin line, it looks like you had some pretty good pull through in the quarter despite obviously in the headwinds you've had on the top line. I know, Pete, you gave some commentary as we head into next year. What are the biggest, sort of, puts and takes in terms of the ability to get sort of leverage in line with what we've seen historically from the business in sort of the 50 to 100 basis points area? Is it maybe some potential pressures on the raw material side? Is it the salary increases? Where do we have the biggest variability in terms of where we could be better or worse in that range?", "Peter Wilver", "Well, the biggest variability really comes from the top line. The productivity initiatives that we drive, that is something that we're doing no matter what's going on in the economy. So we're driving that and that generates around 2% or 200 basis points of margin expansion year-over-year, and that offsets the inflation that we see in the investments that we're making. And then the rest really comes down to pull through on organic growth. Certainly, if we saw differences in the top line, the investments are, at some level, discretionary, obviously, so we could manage that. But primarily, the productivity is offsetting inflation in investments.", "Marc Casper", "Ross, we're in a good rhythm with the operating margin expansion.  If you look at it this year, we increased margins by 80 basis points and still allowed us to significantly increase R&D and Asian expansion. You look at next year's guidance range, were at 50 to 80 basis points of margin expansion again and we feel good about the momentum we have there.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "And in terms of the Dionex acquisition, where are we in terms of what your current sort of preferences in terms of how to finance that deal in terms of how you -- given the favorable depth markets, how you're thinking about kind of the capital structure on a go-forward basis?", "Peter Wilver", "Ross, we haven't really changed our view on the financing. We said we would fund it with debt and the interest cost would be something in the range of 3% to 3.5%. Those assumptions are still consistent. We, most likely, will prefund the acquisition just to make sure that we lock into the current favorable rates.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So just in terms of your comments on the interest expense and for the guidance, I mean, that's not inclusive of the potential financing of that to occur at some point in the first part of the year?", "Peter Wilver", "No, it does include the assumption that we'll prefund the acquisition.", "Operator", "The next question will come from the line of Dan Leonard, Leerink Swann.", "Daniel Leonard - First Analysis", "I want to better understand your thinking on the top line forecast for 2011. So it looks like you're expecting, even when you back out all of the temporary gymnastics from both 2010 and 2011, that you're expecting some softening of the organic growth rate in 2011 from 2010 levels. I guess, can you guide me through your thinking behind that expectation at the midpoint?", "Marc Casper", "We don't think too much about these gymnastics, Dan. But we're trying to make this as clear as possible. If you look at 2010, and you just take out flu and Biosite, which is noise in the system, we grew 6%, in terms of organic growth. When you look at 2011, the midpoint of our guidance when you take out the headwind is 5%, so there's a 1 point Delta. What's the 1 point Delta? It's just comparisons, right? If you look at it, the 6% was versus a negative 3%, which was the 2009 numbers. The 5% growth is versus really the positive momentum we had in 2010. So it's a much harder comparison. We're effectively saying that we're going to grow at the same rate. So we're actually getting increasingly bullish in terms of what the end markets look like and what the world holds.", "Dan Leonard - First Analysis", "Marc, you mentioned that you're broadening your approach you've taken with your top accounts to more accounts. What does that mean?", "Peter Wilver", "What that means is, we have, over the last four years, consistently grown with our large accounts, faster than the company average. We've learned a lot about how to do standardization programs, how to utilize our very deep set of capabilities. We're going to be using those capabilities for a broader set of customers going forward. We've experimented with a number of things over the years. And as I talk about performance in 2011, I'll be talking more broadly, not just about top customers, but how we're doing in the marketplaces and gaining market share.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Amit Bhalla, Citi.", "Valerie Dixon", "This is Valerie Dixon actually in for Amit. I was wondering if you could dive a little deeper into your Pharma end markets. Have you seen any consistency You said that you're working with the FDA on some sort of testing guidelines. What do you expect in terms of implementation of the food safety bill and the timeline for you guys to finalize some of your familiar discussions with the FDA and perhaps when do you expect to see some revenue contribution from your handheld instruments and other instruments that would serve that market?", "Marc Casper", "When you look at the implementation guidelines that are in effect, it's typically about an 18-month window that food producers have to be getting in compliance. So that means that you'll likely see some benefit late this year and into 2012 in terms of timeframe for when would you would expect to see an incremental opportunity from food safety beyond the strong momentum that exist in those markets today.", "Valerie Dixon", "In the North America region, what would you expect to have happen to return this region to growth?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of North America, obviously the business grew during the course of the year and we're seeing the benefits of a recovering economy. In a particular quarter, you're going to have flu and Biosite are North American, that's [indiscernible] 100% where that happened, so the comparison makes North America have the headwind, but that's not anything I'd read into. North America is doing fine.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist, Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "First one, just for Pete on gross margin in 2011. How much improvement should we be looking for next year and maybe some of the major, major drivers  there and beyond the top line, that could make things a little bit better, a little bit worse?", "Peter Wilver", "In terms of gross margin, if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, I gave 50 to 80 basis points as the margin expansion for EBITDA. So the midpoint is around 65 or so basis points. The way that splits out is about 100 basis points of gross margin expansion, so comparable to what we did in 2010, and then probably about 20 basis points of dilution in SG&A. Again, I mentioned the run rate of the expenditures that we put in place in 2010 and about 15 basis points in R&D. So that's how it splits out to the three categories. The key drivers in gross margin expansion, as I mentioned, are really PPI, PPI Lean, low-cost region manufacturing, global sourcing, low-cost region sourcing and restructuring, all the things that we normally do to drive our productivity. So a lot of those benefits fall into the gross margin category.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one other one for me. I know you referred to kind of the organic growth picture improving over the year. So given kind of where you stand today and looking at what you're seeing on the industrial end markets, and obviously, some of the other major geographies, where would you expect to sort of to be exiting the year? Would that be kind of over the second half, should we be thinking more on par sort of in this fixed range with 2010?", "Peter Wilver", "You're talking about the quarterly phasing of organic growth?", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Exactly. So if things are getting better over the year, kind of where should we expect to be finishing or where should we expect to be by the second half?", "Peter Wilver", "I would say the second half would be in the higher end of the mid-single digits to the lower end of high-single digits.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Paul Knight, CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Marc, you ever wish you were in gene sequencing instrumentation?", "Marc Casper", "Only in the sense of the weather is better in Florida where the conference is than it is in the Northeast. But no, to really answer the question, I'm very comfortable with our portfolio. Clearly, gene sequencing, there's a lot of activity going on, but it's a pretty crowded field and it's one that we benefit by being a supplier to most of those companies. We supply reagents, we supply technology and we're happy with our position.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "When you see all the genomes that will be done this year, what's your read through? Is it significant enough on the products you provide that it adds to growth and I guess this activity continues in the years ahead?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. I mean, we get a little bit of a benefit from the expansion of sequencing, from the way we participate in that market.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Did you talk about geographies and growth?", "Marc Casper", "We did. And Pete, if you want us to rehash, we can go through the...", "Peter Wilver", "Are you talking about forward look or backward look?", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "Just the quarter, Pete.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "In terms of the quarter, it's Asia Pac in the high-single digits and then North America and Europe in mid-single digit declines, because of the calendar and flu and Biosite, as Marc mentioned. For the full year, which is probably a better way to look at it, North America in the mid-single digits, Europe in the low-single digits and Asia Pac around 10%.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I just want to follow up on your comments earlier-on on Pharma. The news out of Pfizer yesterday wasn't so positive on R&D talking about $1 billion to $2 billion in cost cuts. Can you just talk a little bit about what your dialogue is like with Pharma now? And do you have to kind of step up your initiatives here? In the past, you had also talked about a more strategic deal with Lilly. So are you seeing interest also in kind of a longer-term, more strategic deals from Pharma as they look to consolidate the channel?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, I mean, obviously, when a customer segment is going to change, one could view it as negative or positive, for us it's positive. We are so much larger than anybody else with these customers. We have better access. We have more capabilities. Our adoptive capabilities here is incredible. So we help our customers meet those challenges. And as companies are going through those changes, we're working with them to meet their goals. And we have a number of examples where we have active dialogue about helping them meet meaningful productivity goals. And for us, we're very well-equipped to help them do that, and that's a share gain opportunity for us that we're focused on capitalizing on.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "So then as we think about your broader portfolio, obviously, there's been some discussion about Athena and Lancaster labs. Can you just talk either on that type of divestitures, specifically, or how you look at opportunities to trim the portfolio?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of a theme and Lancaster, we really don't comment on speculation in the press. So I'm going to leave that one aside. And that's just consistent with all of our policies on speculation. In terms of more divestitures and how we think about it, we periodically review the portfolio to make sure that we have the best portfolio and that we're creating shareholder value by owning the various things that we own. And every once and while, we'll sell something that's small where we think it's better owned by somebody else. But we have a good managing process with our good businesses.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "On capital deployment, post Dionex, can you talk about potentially your willingness to do another deal, what kind of ROIC targets you'll be looking at and how you could look to lever up if needed beyond closing Dionex deal?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of the capital deployment strategy, it's going to continue to be a blend of return of capital through buybacks as well as acquisitions, provided they meet our criteria, which has strengthened the strategic position of the company, enhancing our offering from a customer perspective and clearly, creating shareholder value so that we have ROIC's well above our cost of capital, in that metric. Dionex, as I've mentioned in the past, really just is part of one division within one of our groups. So from a management bandwidth perspective, we have plenty of bandwidth if the right acquisitions were available that met our criteria. So if we see one that we feel good about, it will do them. And if there's one that if we don't see a pipeline at that point in the year, we won't. And obviously 2010 was a really good year in terms of M&A. There's lots of good activity and we'll continue to look for the right opportunities.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Doug Schenkel, Cowen and Company.", "Unidentified Analyst", "This is [indiscernible] for Doug. Just quickly on pricing in the quarter, just asking how things are trending both in Instruments and Consumables and any market commentary is helpful. And then, similarly, looking through 2011, what you're expectations are?", "Marc Casper", "So pricing in the fourth quarter was pretty similar to the third quarter: Consumable, stronger; instruments, a little bit more competitive. For the full year, for the company, we had just under 1% price. For 2011, were looking and anticipating very similar market conditions to 2010.", "Unidentified Analyst", "You guys talked a little bit earlier this year about opening an office in Brazil and ROW had a nice growth this quarter. When we think of emerging markets outside of China, maybe just some commentary on and expectations there. And is that going to become, I guess, a bigger part of the business going forward?", "Marc Casper", "When you look at where we're focused, we've been building out our Asian presence pretty dramatically, and that's China, India. China is our biggest priority, then India. A number of the other Asian countries, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia are three examples where we've been building our presence. In terms of outside of that, probably Brazil is the only other one that's significant in terms of opportunity. The economy's obviously very strong. There's a big focus on alternative energy sources. When you're doing alternative energy production, typically, you're a large consumer of instrumentation, which is good for us. So there's not a long list of other countries you'll see us talking about in terms of emerging markets, but I think Brazil, at this point, merits inclusion with that group.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Jon Wood, Jefferies & Company.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Pete, could you quantify the flu and Biosite impacts. You separate them for the fourth quarter?", "Peter Wilver", "Flu was about negative $20 million and Biosite about negative $35 million when you offset it against the alternative supplier.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "That's a net number, $35 million?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, net $35 million. So a total of about $55 million of headwind.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then the calendar was between 4% and 5%? Is that right?", "Peter Wilver", "It's around 4%. It's difficult to get that exact number, but it's about 4%.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then the next one is if you look at 2011 and you net out Japan, so I know that $50 million. But is there a net effect from stimulus on the business in '11 versus '10 when you take out the effects of Japan?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, it's still a little bit additional decline above the $50 million of Japan. The reason we're calling out Japan is because it's $50 million in one quarter, so it's a pretty significant impact. Overall, stimulus is down more than the $50 million, but we are assuming that we'll make that up with other orders.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Isaac Ro, Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Marc, can you maybe address sort of your general outlook on hospital base trends in 2011 when we kind of normalize for the flu and Biosite? And specifically, are you seeing any notable changes in underlying patient volumes in the parts of your business that have exposure there? And as we look into 2011, any kind of a recovery here that would impact your business?", "Marc Casper", "So when you look at the healthcare customers, which is primarily our Clinical Diagnostics business. Once you normalize for flu and the Biosite transition, we see that as a mid-single digit growing business. We didn't see any significant effect from patient volume on the downside. So if that happened for other companies, I don't think it's going to be a big factor one way or another for us in 2011. We're looking at pretty stable trends in our healthcare customer base.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "And maybe just secondly on the outlook for China. Is there any reason at  saying that there would be tough comps in that region this year in the environmental testing business. Just given the Shanghai World Expo last year and some of the strength you've seen in the last couple of years, any reason to think that might change?", "Marc Casper", "When we look at our detailed plan for China, we feel good about the outlook for 2011. So obviously, you get some big orders in different parts of the business, but there's a good pipeline of other big orders going forward. So I feel like it will be okay in terms of our outlook there.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Any impact from the recent snowstorms, in terms of shipping phase to watch out for? And then second, some more broad-lined industrial companies have talked about, are they seeing any impact in inflation and cost of goods? And are you seeing anything on your side? Historically, I remember it hasn't been a big factor, but I just figured I'd ask just to see what you're seeing given the chatter that we've heard throughout this earnings season?", "Marc Casper", "First, on inflation, we're not seeing a big impact in our ability to offset any inflationary pressures. Our track record is good here, so we feel comfortable with the inflationary environment from a cost management perspective. From a snowstorm perspective, that's obviously not a positive. At this point, we're nothing seeing it being significant. It's obviously been an unusual first four weeks of the year if you leave in the Northeast, as certainly kids are spending a lot of time at home. That hasn't helped, but it's very early in the quarter. So I'm not worried about it at this point.", "Operator", "And the next question will come from the line of Derik De Bruin, UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So just to clarify. On the interest expense line, so if I understood your discussion with Ross, you're taking a hit on the interest expense by prefunding the Dionex deal and that's the Delta for basically being flat year-over-year. Correct?", "Peter Wilver", "That's correct.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "That's the biggest difference in my model.", "Marc Casper", "It's just the timing. You can't wait until the last second to close. You have to have the money in advance. So you're going to be out in front of it a little bit, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And I guess, when you kind of look at some of the potential synergy opportunities for, particularly, with Dionex. I mean, could you talk a little bit about where they might have a benefit in terms of being more exposed on those markets than you? I mean although Thermo has a big catalog, you're still not as well-penetrated in some places as they could be. So just talk about it, what do you get from them when they're exploiting their distribution network.", "Marc Casper", "So really if you think about where we benefit from their presence is they have a very strong presence in environmental labs, right? So effectively, every environmental lab is going to have outlying chromatograph. And 30% of environmental labs are going to have a Thermo Scientific ICP. So there's 65% of those labs -- and by the way, every environmental lab has an ICP. So there's just some natural -- you've got a new customers set that you're going to be able to call on and over time, show our exquisite technology to those customers. That's a very obvious example. On the flip side, we're down. It's just going to benefit us, obviously, we have a huge penetration into all of the HPLC customers. They have great technology in HPLC and we'll be able to leverage that presence to help expand our HPLC business.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "What's your outlook on what's going on in Washington right now?", "Marc Casper", "So, NIH seems to be relatively protected. We're not obviously expecting a robust funding environment, but not big changes in '11 versus '10, that's how we're seeing it.", "Operator", "And that question will come from the line of Peter Lawson, Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Peter, I may have missed this, your outlook on gross margins. What was it for 2011? And was there any one-time effect in 4Q?", "Peter Wilver", "The outlook for gross margins was about 100 basis points of margin expansion and there's not really any one-time effects in Q4 in gross margin.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "And then regarding the new markets. Are there any new products we should be thinking about for, say, food safety or China or India?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of product launches. I mean, we're very excited about the ASMS Conference in the middle of the year for mass spectrometry. We expect it to be another great year for us. We're always launching new products all the time, so across the broad product portfolio, you're not going to go a month without something exciting. But I think ASMS will be a really great year for us, in terms of product launches.", "So let me just make a quick closing comment. First, thanks for joining us. 2010 was a great year, financially and operationally, and our performance positions us well to achieve our goals for 2011. Our industry leadership, coupled with our unique combination of growth investments, operational excellence and a strong balance sheet gives us many opportunities for creating shareholder value. Thanks again for joining us today and I look forward to updating you on our progress in subsequent calls.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] And now I would like to introduce your host for today, Eileen Pattinson.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, operator, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mark Stevenson, President and Chief Operating Officer will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Additionally, we'll be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I'll now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory Lucier", "Thanks, Eileen, and thank you all for joining us. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release we put out this afternoon. We had a terrific fourth quarter, with 5% organic revenue growth and $0.90 of earnings per share, rounding out a record year for Life Technologies. For the full year, we achieved 7% organic growth and 200 basis points of operating margin expansion, generating over $1 billion in operating profit. Free cash flow for the year was $614 million. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the large Japanese Police deal, organic revenue growth was, for the fourth quarter and the full year, was 9%.", "Earnings per share grew 17% in 2010, the result of a lot of hard work and focused execution from our teams around the world. Throughout the year, these teams have focused on building shareholder value through excellence in four key areas that ultimately drive our strong financial performance. These areas are product innovation, geographic reach, market expansion and operational excellence. I'll spend a little time highlighting what we have done in each of these areas over the course of the last year.", "In 2010, we launched a multitude of new innovative products that are designed to accelerate the pace of discovery by making research simpler, faster and more accurate. The successes of our Bioproduction business throughout the year is a notable example of how new products are driving top line growth. In 2010, this business grew more than 20%, driven in large part by the success of several newly launched products, including biological detection for the rapid identification of common contaminants in biomanufacturing, and optimized animal origin free media for CHO cells, the most commonly used cell industrial production of protein-based therapeutics. Key product launches in other areas such as sample prep, real-time PCR, bench-time devices and sequencing to name a few, solidified our leadership position in these areas as we continue to provide our customers with the best products available.", "The Instrument business, which makes up approximately 20% of our revenues, grew over 8% in 2010, 14% excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese Police order. This performance was driven in part by the strong demand for the ViiA 7 PCR System, the 3500 CE sequencer and the SOLiD next-generation systems, expanding our footprint in the labs and locking in highly profitable consumable revenue stream benefiting us for the years to come.", "The Consumables business, which makes up the remaining 80% of revenues, grew 7% in 2010 and 8%, excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese Police order. Researchers in every field of science use our consumable products each and every day to perform the fundamental research that advances scientific discovery. Growth in this business continue to be very stable due to the essential nature of these products and the high volume of small orders that we process everyday. Continued investments in R&D and small tuck-in technology acquisitions have allowed us to continually refresh our portfolio and offer cutting-edge technologies across the entire spectrum of biological research.", "Taking a closer look at some of our larger franchises, you can see where these investments and innovation are paying off. Since 2009, we have made a number of investments in our Real-time PCR business, including the acquisition of Stokes Bio in 2010. The Stokes platform is a transformational technology that speed, scalability and high performance will not only drive growth in our traditional PCR applications but also expand our addressable market by taking share from the $1.2 billion micro-array market. ", "With our TaqMan assays, this platform will allow customers to analyze up to 50,000 data points in one hour to get the industry's best quality and most reliable results. The Stokes platform is cost competitive with micro-arrays on per sample basis, performs better than micro-array platforms in terms of throughput and is significant better in terms of the data quality. Early access to the Stokes Bio platform will be available this year with a full launch expected in early 2012.", "Internal investments in R&D resulted in the 2010 launch of the ViiA 7 platform, a truly innovative product that takes out 60% of its steps in the PCR run, greatly increasing productivity in the lab. This product, along with a variety of new assays, have accelerated growth and increased our market share in the real-time PCR business. Excluding the impact of H1N1 pandemic, growth in this business has accelerated from 9% in 2009 to 12% in 2010.", "Sequencing is another area where we're making tremendous progress. One year ago, Jonathan Rothberg introduced the Ion Torrent technology to the world at the Advances in Genome Biology and Technology conference. Since that time, the rate of technological advancement has been unprecedented, with throughput consistently increasing 10x every six months during the systems development. Today, the 314 chip delivered 10 megabytes of throughput and the 316 chip available in the second quarter, will deliver 10 megabases of data. ", "In the six weeks since PGM was launched, demand has continued to accelerate and a growing user community is rapidly developing applications for the system. You will hear more about this on Friday when at this year's conference, five of the industry's leading researchers will present data generated with Ion Torrent technology. ", "As the system continues to scale up, its speed and simplicity have generated a significant level of interest in the scientific community. We are seeing an increasing number of innovative vendors developing technologies that streamline workflows both up and downstream at the PGM system, making the technology even more attractive to scientists who don't have the resources to invest in higher cost, more complex next-generation sequencing technologies.", "Continued advancements and lower cost sequencing solutions, such as Ion Torrent, directly address the tactical needs and the financial hurdles facing the research community, opening up the market to labs of all sizes. As more government and private funding bodies around the world dedicate a higher percentage of the resources to genetic research, the trend towards using sequencing to solve a wide range of biological questions accelerates. Life Technologies is in a unique position to benefit from this increase in demand. Sales of our SOLiD instruments and consumables have grown 50% year-over-year and we are very pleased with the level of interest in the SOLiD 5500, which will begin shipping later in the first quarter.", "But just as importantly, we offer products that simplify and streamline the upfront sample prep and library creation, as well as products that enable virtually every step of the data analysis and the downstream research that takes place after the sequence is completed. And because discoveries ultimately lead to more questions, the cycle of demand for our products continues. The unparalleled breadth of our product offering, coupled with world-class distribution, service and support infrastructure, ensures that there is no company better positioned to capitalize on this opportunity than Life Technologies.", "In order to support the growing demand for our products, we have made specific investments over the last year, which will allow us to better service our customers in emerging markets around the world. Our sales in emerging markets are growing at a compounded annual rate of 30% and now make up approximately 10% of the company's revenues. We continue to build out our infrastructure to ensure that we're well-positioned in these fast-growing areas.", "In 2010, we took a number of actions to further this goal, including the expansion of our distribution networks in Singapore and China, as well as the acquisition of Labindia, a long-time distributor of Applied Biosystems products in that country. With operations throughout the country, our customers in India will now have better access to a robust line of both instruments and consumable products as well as greater sales, customer and technical service support. The acquisition of Labindia, along with other investments in Asia Pacific and Latin America, will allow us to capture the full opportunity in these fast-growing regions.", "Before I hand it over to David to walk you through the numbers, I'll talk about another major milestone for the company that we delivered in 2010. In the fourth quarter, we put actions in place that will deliver another $20 million in synergies associated with the Applied Biosystems integration. Through focused execution on the integration plan, we were able to deliver on our promise of $175 million in annualized synergies, one full year ahead of schedule. We ended 2010 with industry-leading operating margins of 28.7%, an expansion of 210 basis points from the prior year.", "Over the next few years, we will continue to refine our operations and generate savings through increased manufacturing productivity, supply-chain efficiencies and fixed cost leverage, which will expand operating margins to over 31% by the end of 2013. To further our goal, we have created a dedicated team that will lead this effort over the next several years. We have a number of specific projects that we're kicking off in 2011, including optimization of our manufacturing and distribution networks, streamlining of our marketing programs and enhancements to our website. Over the course of 2011, we will share details with you on some of our projects and provide quarterly updates on specific actions that are being put in place to generate savings in the business in the time to come.", "And with that, I will now hand it over to David.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. This quarter revenue grew 7% to $934 million. Currency had no impact on reported revenue growth, while acquisitions contributed an additional two points. Excluding the impact from currency, acquisitions and divestitures, revenue grew 5% and it grew 9% also excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese Police deal.", "Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: the Americas grew 7%; Europe, 3%; Asia Pacific, 12%; Japan, declined 4%. Excluding the impact of H1N1 and the Japanese Police order: the Americas grew 10%; Europe, 5%; Asia Pacific, 17%; and Japan grew 10%. Similar to prior quarters, stimulus-related revenues for the fourth quarter were approximately $10 million.", "Genetic Systems had revenues of $246 million, representing 11% organic growth. Overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 4% for the quarter, driven by mid-teens growth in consumables and accelerating demand for our 3500 Genetic Analyzer. Growth in this business, particularly instruments, was negatively impacted by a difficult year-over-year comparison resulting from last year's Japanese Police order. Excluding the impact of this order, overall sales of CE instruments and consumables grew 10% for the quarter and 8% for the full year.", "In addition, the Next Generation Sequencing business demonstrated strong double-digit growth in the quarter. For the full year, our SOLiD instruments and consumables continued to gain share, growing 50% year-over-year. Sales of the recently launched Personal Genome Machine are off to a good start and we anticipate that Ion Torrent-related revenue will be a significant contributor to growth in the second half of 2011.", "Molecular Biology Systems had revenues of $445 million in the quarter, representing a decline of 1% in organic growth. However, excluding H1N1-related revenue, organic growth was approximately 4% for the quarter and 6% for the full year.", "As Greg mentioned earlier, acceleration in demand of real-time PCR consumables and instruments as well as strong demand for genomic assays contributed to this growth. Also, royalty revenue for this division grew 14% for the year as a result of the concerted efforts of our licensing team, which was able to more than offset the decline in PCR patents. For the total company, royalty revenue grew 7% for 2010.", "Cell Systems had revenues of $238 million for the quarter, representing 11% organic growth for the quarter and 12% growth for the year. Growth in this division was driven by strong demand across the portfolio. For the full year, the Bioproduction, Dynabeads and Stem Cell businesses all delivered double-digit growth.", "Moving on to other items. Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 64.6%, 40 basis points lower than the same period last year. Increased productivity in the quarter was offset by the negative impact of mix, primarily higher sales of instruments and bioproduction. On a sequential basis, gross margin declined as expected by 220 basis points due to the impact of lower realized price mix and higher manufacturing expenses as we produced less and drew down inventory at year end.", "Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses increased 4% over prior year's levels to $357 million. The increase was primarily the result of acquisition-related expenses. Sequentially, operating expenses increased 9%, the result of acquisition-related expenses and investments in R&D.", "Non-GAAP operating income was $245 million, an increase of 9% over prior year. Fourth quarter operating margins were 26.3%, representing 50 basis points of improvement year-over-year. The increase in operating margin was the result of synergy savings, partially offset by slightly lower gross margins.", "For the full year, operating income increased 17% to just over $1 billion. Operating margins were 28.7%, an increase of 210 basis points. Operating margin expansion was the result of improved gross margins and operating expense synergies, partially offset by acquisition-related costs.", "In terms of other income line items for the quarter, we had $1 million of interest income and no material impact from currency gains and losses. Interest expense for the quarter was $28 million. Other income for the full year included $4 million of interest income and no material impact from currency gains and losses. Interest expense for the full year was $113 million.", "Our non-GAAP tax rate for Q4 was 21%, down from 28.5% for the first nine months. The extension of the R&D tax credit contributed three percentage points of the approximately seven percentage point decline. Other legislative changes regarding treatment of non-U.S. income that were also enacted in Q4 retroactive to the beginning of the year contributed another 2.5 percentage points. The remaining two percentage points is from a combination of items, including greater income earned in lower tax rate jurisdictions and onetime benefits from the integration of acquired subsidiaries. For the full year, the non-GAAP tax rate was 26.7%.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 191.2 million shares and 190.6 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased all the shares associated with the Ion Torrent acquisition and completed the full 350 million share repurchase authorization by the end of the first week in January. The total amount of shares repurchased was 9.4 million, approximately 5 million of the repurchased shares did not impact the weighted average share calculation for 2010 because they were purchased late in the fourth quarter. The full impact of the share repurchase will be realized in 2011, but will be partially offset by dilution related to our convertible debt and share-based compensation programs.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.37 for the fourth quarter, which includes $0.40 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.10 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share were $0.90. For the full year, GAAP diluted earnings per share were $1.99, which includes $1.05 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.13 per share of non-cash interest expense associated with the adoption of APB 14-1 and $0.38 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, full year diluted earnings per share were $3.55.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $855 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $537 million. Cash from operating activities was $225 million. Capital expenditures were $42 million and free cash flow was $183 million. Full year free cash flow was $614 million, including $94 million of integration-related costs. In December, we issued $800 million in senior notes. Our ending debt as of December 31 was approximately $3.1 billion. This balance consists of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $2.3 billion. Return on invested capital decreased 10 basis points to 9.1%. However, we remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% return on invested capital by 2012. I'll now move on to our outlook for 2011.", "We expect revenue to grow organically in mid-single digits. Revenue from acquisitions will add in another approximately one percentage point to revenue growth. As we've discussed previously, we have currency hedges in place that will impact the first seven months of the year. Because of the size and timing of the impact of these hedges, I'll give you some more color on what to expect throughout the year.", "As of December 31, month end rates, currency for the first half of the year is expected to have no impact on revenue and a negative 160 basis point impact on gross margins in each of the first two quarters. Earnings per share will be negatively impacted by $0.08 in the first quarter and $0.05 in the second quarter. In the second half of the year, currency is expected to have no material impact on revenue, gross margins or earnings per share. As a result, the full year impact of currency is expected to have no material impact on revenue, a negative 50 basis points impact on gross margin and a negative $0.13 impact on earnings per share. For the full year, gross margin will be flat to slightly down from prior year. ", "Operating margin expansion is expected to be 75-plus basis points for the full year, but negative in the first half due to the impact of currency. As Greg mentioned earlier, we are on track to achieve 31% operating margins by the end of 2013. Non-GAAP earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $3.80 to $3.95. For modeling purposes, you should keep in mind that due to the impact of currency and the ramp up of revenue from acquisitions completed in 2010, earnings per share will be slightly weighted towards the back half of the year. To help you better count for these factors on a quarterly basis, I will give you a little more color on what to expect throughout the year.", "Due to exceptionally strong performance in the first quarter of last year, organic revenue growth in the first quarter of 2011 is expected to be in the low-single digits. As a reminder, organic growth in the first quarter of 2010 was 10%, the result of U.S. and Japanese stimulus programs and the last installment of the Japanese Police order. Due to lower revenue growth and the impact of currency, earnings growth is expected to be flat to down 5% in the first quarter of the year. However, excluding the impact of currency, earnings per share is expected to grow in the mid- to high-single digits.", "Looking beyond the first quarter, you should expect both revenue and earnings growth to accelerate throughout the year. Revenue growth will increase as sales from Ion Torrent ramp up and benefits from productivity initiatives started earlier in the year will also accelerate earnings growth. We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $675 million to $700 million for 2011. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $125 million to $150 million, including approximately $20 million of restructuring-related capital.", "Our free cash flow forecast also includes approximately $80 million of onetime expenses related to restructuring. It's important to note that as in the past, our free cash flow will be higher in the second half of the year due to normal working capital fluctuations and the payout of annual bonuses in the first quarter.", "A few other items related to our expectations in the coming year include the following: royalty revenue is still projected to decline by $20 million in 2011, the result of a decline in the PCR royalties as patents expire throughout the year; the pro forma tax rate will be approximately 28%, that is down from the 29.5% that we guided to at the beginning of 2010. Interest income will fluctuate depending on our cash balance. Our average interest rate on investments is approximately 25 to 35 basis points. Interest expense is expected to be approximately $135 million. Assuming an average share price of $55, we would expect the weighted average diluted share count for 2011 to range from 185 million to 187 million shares. Share count will depend on the amount and timing of share repurchases throughout the year and dilution related to our convertible debt and share-based compensation programs. For the first quarter, a good estimate of the share count would be 188 million shares. ", "And finally, here are a couple of other variables that may help in modeling the business. First, you can assume that every point of organic growth contributes about $0.09 to earnings per share. Second, every $10 million in operating expenses equals about $0.04 per share. And third, if all currencies move against the dollar by 5%, our mix of foreign currency stayed the same, the impact on earnings per share would be about $0.15.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Eileen, so we can answer any questions you may have.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, David. John, we're now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question coming from Quintin Lai. [Robert W. Baird]", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "First question, last quarter you talked about ERP installation in Asia and it looks like that things rebounded growth-wise there. Any update on that and other initiatives that you have planned for that region for growth in 2011?", "Gregory Lucier", "That's right, Quintin. So our Asia Pacific business overall rebounded nicely as we predicted it would once we got past this ERP implementation. In terms of further investments we've made in that region, there have been several. First, as we noted in the script, we acquired Labindia, which gives us significant warehousing, technical support, sales force capability on the Applied Biosystems side of the business. We also completed the development of a very large logistics center in Singapore to house tens of thousands of products to serve the region. And we also started on building several warehouses across China in the coastal cities to further expand the footprint we already had. We had outgrown the infrastructure we had put in place a few years earlier. So those are some notable achievements across the Asia Pacific region.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "And then Greg, as you look out to 2011 and with the guidance, are you expecting kind of a continuation of the end markets that you have now or especially -- we're getting a lot of questions on what are you thinking, what are your thoughts on the academic side and potential NIH funding? Any color would be helpful.", "Gregory Lucier", "In our estimate, we have presumed a fairly stable funding environment. We continue to see good strength in the biotech/pharma sector across the world. We think academic funding will be basically flattish versus last year, and we're not counting on any improvement in the NIH in our forecast. We see continued robust demand in the Asia Pacific region and Latin America and the Middle East. And so those factors are what drive our overall forecast for revenue in 2011.", "Operator", "And our next question is coming from Doug Schenkel. [Cowen and Company]", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "One clarifying question on Q4. Maybe folks just didn't have it modeled right, but if I remember correctly, I think you guys guided operating margin expectations to 150 basis point year-over-year increase in Q4. If I'm remembering correctly, you clearly came up a bit short of this, which seems attributable to weaker than expected gross margin, at least given relative to work incentives was. Did you come up short here? And if so could you talk through some of the reasons why the pricing? Is it currency? Mix? Royalty? What happened to gross margin line?", "Eileen Pattinson", "So this is Eileen. We had a couple of things impacting in the quarter. Nothing unusual. We had a higher mix of bioproduction than we expected in the quarter and that brings the margins down slightly. We also had, as expected, sequential reduction in pricing, which is typical in the fourth quarter of every year. And we had sequential reduction I believe in royalties as well, which would have also brought down margins.", "David Hoffmeister", "To answer your question Doug, I think it was in line with what we expected. It wasn't anything unusual, and similar to what we've experienced in prior years.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "So that gross margin again that -- you guided gross margin, I think to decline sequentially, which clearly it did. Although I don't think people were modeling that it would be down quite this much. If that was in line with expectation and then -- I think the operating line was a little bit lower, is that not correct?", "David Hoffmeister", "We did make some investments in R&D in the quarter as well in things like Attune, Ion Torrent and we also invested in Bioproduction, which Greg mentioned earlier.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And then in terms of the guidance, mid-single digit growth is not a surprise especially given you've talked about that before. That being said, how should folks view this, I mean, first off, what does mid-single digit mean? I mean, is that 4% to 6%? And given you guys did 9% organic growth in 2010, excluding H1N1, should folks be -- would you be surprised that people are disappointed by this, given it does imply a moderation which seems a bit surprising given your ability to get price, predictable volume and the growth in emerging markets?", "David Hoffmeister", "I think mid-single digits is you pick your number, but I would say, it's somewhere 4% to 6%. And we said we would expect something around 1% or so from acquisitions over the course of the year. And I think that, that is actually in line with what we experienced this year. Remember, you have to adjust for comps as well. So there are a couple of things in our growth rate this year that make comparisons for next year slightly more challenging. We talked about the first quarter where we had exceptional growth last year. And we're expecting lower growth in the first quarter this year as a result. Second, Bioproduction business grew at 20-plus percent. That's phenomenal performance for that business this year. And we think that, that business is going to continue to perform as it has over any two or three year period in the high-single digits. But obviously, we're not counting on it growing 20-plus percent next year, so that's a factor. And then the third thing is royalty revenue. Royalty revenue, we're projecting will fall another $20 million next year. Now this year, we've been successful with our licensing group in completely offsetting the drop in -- expected drop in royalties. But at this point in the year, we're not counting on that for next year.", "Operator", "And our next question is coming from Tycho Peterson. [JPMorgan]", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Given that a lot of us nowadays are BP [ph], I'm just wondering stepping back as we think about your sequencing business. In the past, you've provided some thoughts on your overall level of spend. Are you going to talk a little bit about kind of your overall level of spend? And then as we think about Ion Torrent talk a little bit more maybe about a go-to-market strategy, sounds like maybe your shifting some resources from SOLiD over to Ion Torrent? If you can talk a little bit about integration and implement development plans that'd be helpful.", "David Hoffmeister", "Sure, Tycho. The overall spend is about the same just maybe slightly elevated. And as you stated, there has been a shift in our resources as the 5500 SOLiD machine is now basically being launched. We have a very large development team that has been able to augment the Ion Torrent team and really accelerate now that development. So I think that's the way you can consider our investment and how we shifted it.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then if we think about the capillary business, can you talk to your expectations? I mean, you guys obviously, had more resilience there, better than I think people originally anticipated there in next gen. Can you just talk to how sustainable some of those underlying trends are?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes. I think the best way to describe the CE business is to bifurcate the end market for it. So on the applied markets side, forensics, food testing and the like, that's a very sticky business. It is a very well-received product early now in the life cycle, and so we anticipate very good demand for CE instruments on the applied markets side for some time to come. On the research side, where I think everybody has been pleasantly surprised, that product has continued to have an uptake and I think it's primarily due that it is the gold standard in sequencing. So as more and more sequencing gets done, more validation has to get done, more confirmatory analysis gets done, and it's being done on CE because it is as I say the gold standard. And this product is a dynamite product, it's very well-received and I think that's why we're seeing continued demand for what everyone else thought would have perhaps been obsolete by now.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then just one last one, you mentioned Bioproduction in your comments a few times, talk to some of the trends there, is it largely a shift over to biodisposables and what's your visibility on that market for 2011?", "Gregory Lucier", "Right. As David said, that's a business that cycles through every couple of years. These very high demand years as a product gets approved by the FDA, and then perhaps modulates as other products are not approved in the subsequent year. But overall, it's a trend line that's in the high-single digits, sometimes low double digits. We benefited in 2010 by the approval of a couple of products, by increased demand of therapeutics of customers that we had and by further penetration of new customers based on a strategy we put in place several years ago to link our Research business with the Bioproduction business and follow these molecules from the very earliest stage. So 2011, as David said, it's going to be a good year for that business. It's just not going to grow at 20% again. And I think it's very normal to see that type of cycle.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Derik De Bruin. [UBS]", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So just following up a little bit on Tycho's, I mean, you launched Ion Torrent. Could you just give us a taste on how you see the development progressing, particularly in respect to the sample prep or is that one you're going to highlight at AGBT this week?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, I think that's something we're going to highlight more at AGBT. But a couple of points I would make on Ion Torrent, and one is that, we have tried to indicate the scalability of the machine itself. And so we fundamentally believe we're now moving into a post-life era for sequencing and so we'll be able to articulate that more in quarters to come. On the sample prep question, it's a question we get often asked, you'll hear more at AGBT on what we're doing around the PGM instrument. But suffice it to say, there's work underway and we feel very pleased about the overall total solution that will surround the Ion Torrent technology and we'll have more to communicate on that as time goes on.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And then just one other question. So the goal for reaching a 31% operating margin in 2013 is pretty impressive given how strong the margins are right now. Could you just kind of break it down in terms of what are the moving parts to kind of get to that of level?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes. In the presentation, we shared a particular chart on how we think about this, but let me take you through the various buckets of where the synergy will come from to get the operating leverage. The first thing is that, for example, on purchasing, we are shifting more of the resources to Asia Pacific. Ironically, we do very little sourcing in that fast-growing region today, so we anticipate very nice savings coming from that. We continue to consolidate our sites. We don't publicly announce which ones are affected but as we have stated in other presentations, we have lots of choices and we continue to consolidate the footprint. The other thing that we're doing is just becoming ever more efficient at how we move products at the right moment in time to our very sophisticated logistics centers around the world. Now today, everything is flying basically in FedEx airplanes and things like that, very expensively. We have key strategies in place on how to move this by land and sea at a much more efficient economical way over the next three years. And then lastly, one of our key tenets when we've merged the two companies was to do no harm. And a good example of that was we took each companies' IT system and basically just put a link between the two and ran the company, and we did quite effectively with that. Now over the next three years, we're going to actually shut down the entire IT system of 1/2 of the company, merge it into the other, do it very methodically and we can save tens of millions of dollars as we do that over the next three years. So those are some examples.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Ross Muken. [Deutsche Bank]", "Michael Cherny - Deutsche Bank AG", "Actually, Mike here for Ross. Just kind of talking a bit more about the Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine, I was curious kind of how you see the market developing on near-term basis? You, obviously, talked about some early success you've had. Can you talk about some of the kind of early customers that you've had and kind of where they've come from? And then over the next six, 12 and 18 months, how you see the market developing in terms of who are going to be the early and then kind of later adopters?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, I think it's important to note how sequencing -- next-generation sequencing has actually developed just over the last couple of years, has primarily happened in the heavy users, the genome centers. And so when we think about the technology now moving out over the next few years, we want to put it into as many labs as possible and essentially follow the very successful strategy that we had with qPCR. And so this Personal Genome Machine has been sold to customers that, A, can buy more than one, B, that can collaborate with us on the usage of it, the sample preparation of it, the data analysis of it and quickly iterate with us on improvements, so that we can get them back out to the user community. Now that's phase one of the customer base. I would tell you we're actually holding back orders right now because we want to make sure that, that iteration happens a few more times before we take the next, if you will, level or concentric circle of growth that we see with this PGM instrument. But the PGM instrument, we ultimately believe and further refinements of it can mimic very much like a qPCR machine in terms of its penetration in virtually every lab in the world. Now how that fits in with our strategy is as you can understand, lab technologies has a very broad distribution network. We're in virtually every country that does science, and so a product like this very much plays to our sales and service and technical support strength. And so that's how we're thinking about it.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Marshall Urist. [Morgan Stanley]", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "First question, just for David, on the margin and expense picture for next year, it'd be helpful just first on gross margin, I know you gave us some detail there but where would you think you would exit the year, or, I guess, in the back half of the year? Kind of where would you think you'll be as we start to think about momentum off of the currency dilution into 2011? And then also just plans on R&D and SG&A next year, and how much leverage are you looking for on those lines as well? That'd be helpful.", "David Hoffmeister", "Well, what we've said first, on gross margin, what we said was that gross margin for the year would be roughly flat to down 50 basis points. So we\u2019ve provided it would be down 160 basis points year-over-year in the first half of the year. So that gives you some idea of what the increase is or the acceleration in the second half of the year, on the gross margin line.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "And then on R&D and SG&A?", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, in terms on R&D, we're continuing to, as we said before, target roughly 10% of sales. And SG&A and our other expenses, that's going to be an area where we're focusing on as Greg mentioned, some of the programs that we have underway, whether it be in marketing, plant overhead, whatever, to drive some of our 75-plus basis points of operating margin improvement.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "And then just one other one, if you just talk about 2011 -- I know you talked about a high-level organic growth over but from a segment perspective, from Molecular Biology, Genetic Systems and Cell Systems as we think about, since there's a little bit different comp base in each of those going into '11, could you talk about how you're thinking about those three different segments in 2011? It would be helpful.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Yes, Marshall, this is Eileen. Let me give you some color on what we expect for organic growth by region or by division. For Molecular Biology Systems, we anticipate that to be mid-single digits. For Genetic Systems, we expect that to be high-single digits. And Cell Systems, mid- to high-single digits in terms of organic growth.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Groberg. [Macquarie]", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "First question, Greg, can you maybe -- a lot of focus obviously gets placed on the old legacy AB businesses. Can you maybe talk about how some of the legacy Invitrogen businesses are doing? And I guess, quickly, on the not so much in the Bioproduction business that your talking about but in the Molecular Biology division?", "Gregory Lucier", "Yes, you bet. The Molecular Biology business has been doing okay. I'd say it's been kind of the lower end of mid-single digit growth over the last year and a half or so. The Cell Biology business, the old molecular probes and pieces of Dynal, as Eileen said earlier, is growing very nicely still. And when you then combine it overall with the media business, the Bioproduction business, it has continued to perform in the mid-single digits, higher end of that range overall. So the old Invitrogen has continued to kind of chug along as it always has.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And then if I can just one more, David mentioned kind of the importance potentially of Ion Torrent in the second half of the year starting to contribute some revenues. Can you talk -- obviously a competitor introduced, at least announced a potential product? Can you talk about whether or not in terms of your order book? You've had any success in stalling the market, kind of what you're seeing internally? And then also do you have any constraints from the manufacturing standpoint, can you maybe just talk about your manufacturing capabilities to scale up as that product scales?", "Gregory Lucier", "Yes, I'll grab that one. So I think the good news is that we have a product that we're selling and shipping right now and that other product you mentioned is simply on a piece of paper. And so we're moving forward, taking orders as I said before and doing well, and the product has enormous runway ahead of it. So the good news is that when people buy the PGM, they know they're actually buying a platform that has perhaps even more throughput than that product you mentioned in terms of its specifications. Finally, the last part, you asked about the ability to fulfill the orders. We have relationships, we have a very solid supply chain that we've worked out with Ion Torrent and the suppliers and we feel very good in our ability to deliver.", "David Hoffmeister", "Just to add on that. The chips are from foundry that has massive capacity relative to where our current needs are, and the housing and electronics are manufactured by the same company that manufactured the Xbox. So there is plenty of capacity out there to meet our current needs.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question coming from Amit Bhalla. [Citigroup]", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Two questions. First in Europe, it looks like Europe has been holding in pretty resilient with the 5% organic growth ex H1N1 obviously. Can you talk about just Eastern Europe versus Western Europe and some of the trends you've seen there?", "Gregory Lucier", "Certainly. So Eastern Europe, Middle East, Turkey especially, Israel in particular, Africa, are where we see the real growth happening in that region we call EMEA, most companies do. And so as we move into 2011, more resources are being shifted from Western Europe into those geographic centers. The good news is we already had the infrastructure in place, we'd started this when we merged the two companies and so now we're just adding on more resources to get the growth there versus Western Europe.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Can you put any numbers around it, if you got 5% organic in total Europe, what's the difference between the two? And the second question I have -- my follow-up was on that pricing, can you give us a ballpark of what kind of impact pricing was?", "David Hoffmeister", "Well, I think just on growth in Europe, what we've said before is that we're growing at low- to mid-single digits in most of the large major markets. There's some more uncertainty in some of our smaller markets in Southern Europe, like Greece and Portugal. And then in Eastern Europe and some of the smaller areas, as Greg mentioned, there they tend to grow at a higher end of the range on high-single digits. And then you had a second question?", "Eileen Pattinson", "On pricing.", "David Hoffmeister", "Yes, on pricing. As we've traditionally said, we've gotten roughly 1.5% in terms of price this year and we're targeting another 1% to 2% next year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "I was actually just asking about the hit on pricing in the quarter?", "David Hoffmeister", "The hit? The down on pricing in the quarter?", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Yes.", "David Hoffmeister", "That's just a case of what we typically experience as the year goes on. It is more discounting and degradation of our list pricing. And we also tend to have larger orders placed at the end of the year. And the net result is our net realized price is slightly lower in the quarter than it is in the other quarters.", "Operator", "We'll take our final question coming from Jon Wood. [Jefferies & Company]", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Greg, I think you mentioned RT-PCR growing 12% adjusted in 2010. Is it unreasonable to think that business can grow double digits again in 2011 or are there comp issues that you foresee in 2011?", "Gregory Lucier", "Jon, look I think that business overall has very good fundamentals for a variety of reasons as we've talked before. And we think it will continue to gain share due to the launch of Stokes technology and some other technology that we will be announcing. But we're not prepared yet to give an estimate for 2011 for the Instrument business other than it's going to do, we think, pretty darn good this year.", "David Hoffmeister", "We don't see anything changing in the underlying industry fundamentals.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "And then last one for David. On the cash flow, $80 million of onetime restructuring in '11, is that still related to AB?", "David Hoffmeister", "It's related to, as Greg mentioned, site consolidations whether they be sales office consolidations, back-office consolidations or plant closures. But it also includes other restructuring or productivity improvement initiatives we have underway. So Greg mentioned, we're looking at the marketing organization, how we can do that more effectively. We expect there will be some costs associated with those changes.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "So is that a number that we should expect continues kind of beyond '11 just at a lower level, like will you have these kind of restructuring type of expenses every year or will they completely go away?", "David Hoffmeister", "We will continue to drive productivity improvement all through the business. So I would expect that there would be some costs on an ongoing basis. But they should definitely come down over time as they have. Exactly.", "Eileen Pattinson", "So there's one question I wanted to clarify before we ended the call. I think Doug asked earlier why our operating margin differed from the guidance we gave in Q3? And I just wanted to clarify that, as we saw benefits on the tax line coming through throughout the quarter, we decided at that point it would be a good opportunity for us to make investments back into the business. So that would be why, the reasons why our operating margin guidance is different from our actual results in the quarter, okay? ", "So this concludes our fourth quarter and full year 2010 earnings conference call. This webcast will be available via a replay on our website for three weeks.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host today, Eileen Pattinson, Head of Investor Relations. Please begin.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thank you, John, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' first quarter earnings conference call. Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, Chief Financial Officer.

I hope you all had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier today. Total non-GAAP revenue grew 1% for the quarter to $897 million and grew 2% excluding currency. Due to the difficult year-over-year comparables and the extraordinary events in Japan, organic growth was flat for the quarter. Excluding the impact from these items, organic revenue grew 5% and total revenue grew 6%. Non-GAAP earnings per share declined 2% for the quarter to $0.85. Excluding the estimated impact from Japan, earnings per share was $0.87, representing flat growth year-over-year. ", "As a reminder, guidance for the first quarter was 1% to 3% revenue growth, excluding currency, and EPS flat to down, 5%. And so, I'm pleased to report continued strong underlying growth in the business. Looking ahead, our full year guidance of mid-single digit organic growth for the year is unchanged and we're on track to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $3.80 to $3.95.", "Since we've been getting a lot of questions on the events in Japan, I'll start out by providing an update on that situation. Clearly, the start of 2011 was a difficult one for our employees and customers in Japan. Thankfully, all our employees are safe and our facilities are undamaged. As you might expect, in the aftermath of the disaster, our offices were closed for several days as were many of our customers' labs. However, as soon as it was deemed safe, we commenced operations and began fulfilling customer orders. Never before has the dedication and fortitude of our employees been more apparent. And as a result, we are able to minimize the impact on the company's financial results.", "In terms of impact to our suppliers and partners, our distributors were all relatively undamaged and our regional supply chain was operational within a very short period of time. As we announced earlier in the quarter, our partner Hitachi High Technologies suffered damages at several of their facilities in the Ibaraki Prefecture. The site that was damaged produces our CE instruments and capillary arrays, as well as the 5500 sequencer. ", "For a period of time following the earthquake, the Hitachi site was not manufacturing products as they assessed and repaired damages. As we announced in March, this halt in production caused the delay in shipments of the 5500, which was originally planned for the final weeks of the first quarter. At this point, Hitachi has resumed manufacturing of the 5500, CE instruments and capillary arrays. Customer shipments of the 5500 have begun and we expect to be able to clear a large portion of that backlog in the second quarter.", "The performance of our team during these extremely difficult times is a testament to the culture of execution that pervades the organization. In 2011, we continue on our efforts to create shareholder value by focusing on 4 key performance drivers. These are: Product innovation, geographic growth, expansion into new end markets and operational excellence. We made good progress on all of these areas in the first quarter, laying the groundwork for accelerated growth, both in revenue and earnings in the second half of the year. I'll walk you through some of the highlights before I hand it off to David to give you the detailed financial results.", "Over the last few years, we have assembled a portfolio of innovative products, heavily weighted towards high-margin consumables. It covered the entire spectrum of biological research. Due to the breadth and scale of our operations, our commercial and R&D teams have more conversations and interactions with scientists around the world than any other company in our space. These conversations and our relationships ensure that we understand the needs of our customers better than anyone else. And also serve as the cornerstone of our efforts to bring new products to market that are designed to the make essential research of our customers easier, faster and more accurate.", "In keeping with that goal, we launched a number of new kits and reagents every single quarter. In the first quarter of 2011, we introduced over 20 new consumable products, including a new addition to our gold standard TaqMan family of products, which is designed to detect cancer-related DNA mutations. This novel product was designed with customer needs in mind and is 10x more sensitive than any other product in the market. ", "Another example of our customer-centered approach to innovation is the recently launched Ion OneTouch System. This bench-top device completely automates the sample preparation for the Ion Personal Genome Machine, reducing the time to prepare a sample from it's current 8 hours to less than 3 hours with only 5 minutes of hands-on time. We are particularly excited about this new advancement because the speed and simplicity of sample preparation now matches that of ion semiconductor sequencing. This significantly forward helps make genetic sequencing accessible to every Molecular Biology laboratory whereas as in past, only larger facilities had the expertise and financial resources to acquire and run DNA sequences.", "Sales of the PGM continue to ramp up and have exceeded our expectations on all measures. At the rate we are placing instruments, the PGM will have the highest installed base of any next-generation sequencing instrument within the next 12 months.", "Our second key performance driver is related to capturing the opportunity in emerging markets. We have taken a number of steps in the last few quarters to ensure that we are well-positioned in these markets to provide superior customer support, short fulfillment times and seamless back-office capabilities. ", "To this sense, last quarter we announced the acquisition of Labindia, our Indian distributor. I'm very pleased to say that the integration is going very well and we have made significant progress in setting up a direct sales and support infrastructure in the region. Moving to this type of model in India allows us to strengthen our relationships with customers and ultimately drive revenue growth by creating brand loyalty, increasing consumable attachment rates and increasing volumes by selling across the product lines. ", "Now during the quarter, we also announced the opening of a new Singapore distribution center that will serve as the hub for the Asia Pacific region. This 62,000-square foot state-of-the-art facility is the first of its kind for any life science company in Singapore. It's designed to improve service and ensure quality for our customers throughout the region. The planned expansion of several existing distribution centers in China and India will further support the new hub-and-spoke model, moving us closer to our goal of delivering in-stock products to customers within 3 to 5 days anywhere in the world.", "As we look to the future, we see opportunity to increase our growth rate by moving further into areas like forensics, food testing and molecular diagnostics. High growth in these areas is driven by new legislation and increased funding to find Molecular Biology-based solutions in medical and societal problems. We've had success with adopting our research tools and technologies for use in these market thus far. And have recently announced several new FDA and U.S. FDA approved Real-Time PCR-based  products for use in animal and food testing.", "These products, along with our realtime PCR instruments enable more effective monitoring of the world's food supply by providing food producers with the complete workflow needed to rapidly test for pathogens and monitor the health of animals. ", "On a molecular diagnostics front, the FDA recently granted 510(k) clearance for our stem cell growth medium, a consumable product used to grow human stem cells without the use of traditional animal origin media. This product is the first and only product of its kind to receive clearance by the FDA and we're excited about the potential to accelerate the regulatory review process for regenerative medicine studies. As we are able to participate more in these fast-growing markets, revenue growth for the company accelerates as well. ", "Our last key performance driver, operational excellence, is focused on driving more of the revenue straight to [indiscernible]  . During the quarter we've made significant steps towards achieving our goal of 31% operating margins by 2013. Productivity initiatives are being implemented across the organization and span manufacturing, supply chain and SG&A. ", "Increasing manufacturing productivity by consolidating our manufacturing sites into fewer, more efficient locations is a major element of the plans. In the last several months, we have announced the closure of 6 manufacturing plants. Operations at these facilities will be transferred to designated centers of manufacturing excellence where we can operate at the highest levels of efficiency. In addition, savings associated with running fewer, more efficient plants continues to provide savings options for a number of manufacturing inputs to ensure we are getting the most of every dollar we spend in the manufacturing process.", "A number of initiatives to drive world-class efficiency in our business operations are also underway. Projects include the consolidation of local sales offices around the world, the implementation of shared services for back-office functions and a focus on increasing the effectiveness of our marketing programs. All of these initiatives have kicked off in recent months, and through careful planning and execution, we will begin to see the savings reflected in gross and operating margins beginning in the second half of this year.", "While we were executing on the larger strategies that I have described for you today, we haven't wavered in our attention to detail and the daily operating rigor that drives our culture here at Life. Focus on day-to-day execution is particularly important now due to the unusual challenges that we faced in the first half of 2011, including tough revenue comparables, currency impacts and the launch and ramp up of a few new big product lines. Most of these challenges impact the first quarter and as we move through the year, the tough comps dissipate as does the negative impact of currency on our results. New products, some of which we have yet to announce, as well as the impact of the productivity initiatives I described earlier, will begin to contribute to revenue growth and profitability in the coming quarters. As a result, both the revenue and earnings are expected to ramp up sequentially during the year and we are on track to deliver our full year goals.", "I could not be more pleased with the team's progress towards executing on the performance drivers that I've just described for you and I'm confident in our future. ", "And with that, I'll hand it over to David to walk you through our financial results for the quarter.", "David Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. This quarter, non-GAAP revenue grew 1% over the prior year to $897 million. Currency had a negative 1 point impact on reported revenue growth and acquisitions contributed 2 points. Organic revenue growth was flat for the quarter. However, as you know that growth rate is in comparison to a very strong first quarter last year, where we grew over 10% organically, driven by a number of onetime items including the Japanese Police order and supplemental budget, H1N1 and royalties. Excluding the impact of these items, organic revenue this quarter grew 5% and the impact of the earthquake in Japan accounted for 1.5 to 2 points.", "Moving on to divisional results. Molecular Biology Systems had revenue of $426 million, down 3% organically from prior year. Strong demand for TaqMan assays was offset by slower growth in the PCR and Molecular Biology Reagent businesses, both of which faced a difficult year-over-year comparisons and were negatively impacted by reduced consumables demand in Japan, as the majority of customer labs were shut down for a time in the last few weeks of the quarter.", "Genetic Systems division had revenues of $228 million, down 8% organically from prior year. Growth in this division was negatively impacted by the delayed shipment of the 5500 sequencer due to the earthquake in Japan and slower-than-average sales of the SOLiD 4 System as customers delayed purchasing in anticipation of the 5500 launch.", "Overall sales of CE instruments and consumables declined in the low-single digits for the quarter, the result of a difficult year-over-year comparison. Excluding the impact of these comps, the CE business grew in the low-single digits in line with expectations.", "And as mentioned earlier, sales of the Ion Torrent PGM were strong. Cell Systems had revenue of $238 million, representing 11% organic growth. Growth in the quarter was driven by a strong demand across the portfolio.", "Organic growth by region in the quarter was as follows: the Americas grew 1%; Europe 2%, Asia Pacific 7%; and Japan declined 16%.", "Moving on to the other items. First quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.3%, 200 basis points lower than prior year. Higher price realization was offset by the negative impact of currency and mix. Price realization in the quarter was between 1% and 2%, similar to prior years. Mix was lower due to a year-over-year decrease in royalties and higher-than-expected sales of Bioproduction and the Ion Torrent PGM.", "On a sequential basis, gross margin increased by 180 basis points, primarily due to higher price and productivity, partially offset by the negative impact of currency. ", "First quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $342 million, flat versus prior year levels and a decrease of 4% on a sequential basis. The decrease in operating expense was the result of careful management of headcount and project-related spending in the quarter.", "Non-GAAP operating income was $253 million, a decline of 3.6% from prior year. First quarter operating margin was 28.2%, representing a decline of 130 basis points year-over-year. The decline in operating margin resulted from lower gross margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $1 million from currency and other items and the interest expense for the quarter was $34 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.6%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 186.3 million shares. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares, spending $234 million. In the second quarter, we have repurchased an additional 1 million shares, spending $53 million. At this time, we have approximately 300 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization. As a reminder, other factors impacting share count in the quarter are dilution due to our convertible debt, and employee stock options.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.50, which includes $0.27 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.03 per share of non-cash interest expense and $0.05 per share of business integration costs and other items. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share were $0.85. And approximately $0.87, excluding the impact of the events in Japan.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $735 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $855 million. Cash from operating activities were $115 million, capital expenditures were $17 million and free cash flow was $98 million. Return on invested capital was 8.9%. We remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% ROIC by 2012.", "Our ending debt as of March 31, was approximately $3.1 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $800 million and senior notes of $2.3 billion. ", "Now let me take a moment and talk about our outlook for the next quarter and the rest of the year. In terms of full year guidance, organic revenue is still expected to be in the mid-single digits. Constant currency revenue growth, which includes the impact of acquisitions, is expected to be between 5% and 7%. Our outlook for full year EPS is unchanged, and it is expected to be between $3.80 and $3.95. Looking ahead to the second quarter, constant currency revenue growth is expected to be between 5% and 7%. As of March 31 rates, currency is expected to contribute slightly to second quarter revenue growth and to negatively impact gross margins by approximately 150 basis points because of our hedges, and negatively impact EPS by approximately $0.04.", "Q2 gross margins are expected to be approximately 264 basis points lower than Q2 last year. 150 basis points of the decline is due to the impact of currency. The remaining decline in gross margin is due to the impact of mix, primarily lower royalties, continued growth of the PGM instrument and a relatively high number of 5500 upgrades, including those originally planned in Q1 that will now happen in Q2.", "Full year gross margin is still expected to be flat to slightly down from prior year. Operating expenses in Q2 are expected to be 100 basis points lower as a percentage of revenue than Q2 last year. And as a result, operating margins for the quarter are expected to be approximately 150 basis points lower than prior year. Full year operating margins are still expected to expand by 75 basis points.", "Effective quarter, effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 28%. Average diluted shares in the second quarter are expected to range from 184 million to 186 million assuming an average stock price between $50 and $55. ", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Eileen for Q&A.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Thanks, David. We have about 30 minutes for Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Just first on currency and kind of what's implied by guidance, you guys are sticking with the range but presumably currency should be more favorable than it's been in the past. So has kind of your organic earnings outlook changed so that you're offsetting that currency? You guys being sort of conservative to start the year waiting to see how things play out? A little bit more clarity there would be helpful.", "Gregory Lucier", "Yes. Thanks, Marshall. Yes, at this point, we're not changing our guidance. Currency is positive at the current rates for us versus when we set guidance. But I think it's premature at this point to change our guidance on the expectation of a -- that the  current change will remain. Just to give you an idea, the second half of the year at the current rates, currency would account for an additional about $0.04 per quarter or $0.08 for the full second half of the year.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great.", "Eileen Pattinson", "But, Marshall, just to be clear, our full year guidance is based on December 31 rates. So we have not updated guidance based on the impact from the changing rates. The underlying business is exactly as we saw it when we gave guidance at the beginning.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Greg, maybe if you could just talk about the -- maybe give us a little bit more insight into the underlying kind of underlying business drivers. Japan I think we're pretty clear there, but I think people are going to be wondering kind of organic, underlying organic strengths in the business just given what we saw across, obviously, some of the unaffected geographies like Americas and Europe, quarter-over-quarter. So if we could maybe talk through that on a segment basis and just give us a sense of how those performed in the quarter, I think that would be helpful.", "Gregory Lucier", "You bet. First of all, I think it is important to emphasize the substantial growth we had in the first quarter of 2010. With, as David said, organic revenue growth in excess of 10%, that is a tough comparable to kind of get passed in this first quarter. I think in the Americas, what maybe made it a bit more challenging was simply a slower spend on the research side in academia due to the uncertainty around the final 2010 budget. And so, I think that had some effect of slowing the revenue growth in the first quarter. Now the other dynamic we have is that we're going through, as has been highlighted in a number of different comments, a fairly substantial line shift change. And so the 5500 sequencer is being launched and upgraded out in the field, hundreds of sites, and we didn't see the consumable growth on the SOLiD 4, the existing instrument, to the extent we would have liked because customers were waiting for the 5500. So that had some impact on us in the first quarter. I think the good news here, just to end the story is, that we are seeing record growth of the Ion sequencer. And so we are launching those instruments. They're being installed. And now, we'll start to see the consumable growth from that particular instrument. And so that should have some nice kind of tailwind for us as we move through several quarters. So first quarter for us, as I said in summary, kind of a tough quarter in terms of lots of different things going on, but absolutely right on track for what we're trying to do in the full 2011.", "David Hoffmeister", "The only thing I would add to that, Marshall, is if you adjust for the comps and Japan, and take a look at what our growth rates by -- are by region, they're basically in line with our expectations. So, for example, Americas grew in the low-single digits, Europe was mid-single digits, Asia Pac was in the teens and Japan was low-single digits.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, that's helpful. And just 1 clarification. Just Greg, your comments on the U.S. academic market to start the year were interesting. Is that viewed -- that forecast, is that going to get better now that we have some idea about the 2011 budget from here, or is that still sort of now in the plan and PGM and other things kind of offset that? And then also, just a sense of how big of a contributor Bioproduction was in the quarter. Thanks.", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, the first part, the NIH certainty has -- uncertainty has been lifted for the balance of that fiscal year, and we are starting to see return to kind of the normal trend lines. So that, I think, issue has passed us. In terms of Bioproduction, Bioproduction grew 20-plus percent again this quarter. So Bioproduction contend -- continues to be a terrific story for us.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Maybe starting with Japan. The earthquake had, I think you said a 1.5% to 2% impact on organic growth. Would you be willing to break out how much of this was supply chain versus decline in demand in March?", "Gregory Lucier", "Yes, sure. It was probably about 50-50 in terms of the impact, Japan. And so about half of it due to supply chain and half of it due to lower sales in the last few weeks in Japan itself.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "And the expectation is that the lost sales related to supply chain issues are not actually lost but those sales come back in Q2, is that correct?", "Gregory Lucier", "That's correct.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And then, turning over to Genetic Systems, any chance you would break out the growth rates given that there was some disruption in that group that seems a little bit more pronounced than the other groups? I guess, specifically, would you be able to talk about what the CE growth rate was in basic research, CE in applied market and next-gen sequencing growth within Genetic Systems?", "Gregory Lucier", "That's probably more detail than we want to get into on this call, but we could certainly follow-up on that. Maybe similar to the information I provided on the regions, in Genetic Systems, if we adjust for comps, Japan, the onetime items, the Genetic Systems was actually flat in the quarter.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And last 1, just relative to guidance, you provided either on the Q4 call or subsequent to the Q4 call, any changes in the quarterly pacing that you've talked about or the outlook for business segment by business segment growth?", "Gregory Lucier", "No. Nothing's changed. We're on track for the plan as we originally laid it out.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "I just wanted to dig in to sort of 2 of the kind of more attractive opportunities for you. You talked about the emerging markets a lot more recently, now you kind of detail in here sort of your Asia Pac strategy. And If you think about your share there today versus how you compared to typically maybe an academic campus or a biotech in the U.S. or Europe. And then you think about that next leg of incremental opportunity, what are the types of programs in place today to kind of capture that? And from a sort of C-suite perspective, is that where you're spending kind of maybe a disproportionate amount of time, as well as some of the other kind of points you made in the presentation?", "Gregory Lucier", "Ross, this is Greg. The growth that we see in Asia really centers around winning with the basics. Right now, customers in certain cities have variable supply in terms of when they will get their product and customers, and the rest of the world don't have that variation. We are going to fix that, or I should say, invest in that, so that virtually every major city across Asia can get our 3- to 5-business-day delivery promise that we have with customers. And that's going to be implemented by mid this year. Second thing where we spend our time is investing in the sales infrastructure. So in a country like China, we started in a couple major cities having salespeople augmented with dealers. But now, as we grow, we continue to move more towards 100% of our own sales force in the major cities and we keep adding more geography where we invest in that sales infrastructure. So that's the other big area that we're investing in. And then lastly, we continue to look at opportunities to lower the overall cost structure of the company. A good example of that is our Bangalore R&D facility. Now obviously, that is more on the cost and productivity side of the company, but I'd also have to say it does help with our local image and brand and presence when we do R&D in a country like India that I think helps us in our conversations with scientific researchers there.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "That's definitely helpful. And then on the capital deployment front, I mean it seems like you've been more focused recently on ROIC and certainly you've done some buyback here in the quarter and already in, I guess, Q2. I mean as you think about the balance sheet, the optimal debt levels you'd to get to in kind of the primary uses of capital, what's sort of, for the model or the plan you have, kind of the latest on the preference there?", "David Hoffmeister", "Nothing's changed from what we talked about at the end of the year and we've been talking about for the last 6 months or so. In terms of our debt levels, Ross, we're targeting 2x to 2.5x leverage, and our plan is to stay in that range. Our philosophy is to invest in the future growth of the business. The business, however, generates a lot of free cash flow, and our intent is to return that excess cash to shareholders through share buybacks. We've got, as I said, in the scripted notes, we spent over $200 million in the first quarter, another $50 million in the second quarter and we've got $300 million remaining on our share repurchase program.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great, David. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JP Morgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Maybe just first question on Cell Systems, you had very strong growth there off a pretty big comp. Can you just talk to what you think the underlying growth rate is for that business? Should we think about it being kind of double-digit growth? And maybe just talk to any color you can give on the stem cell opportunity and how big that business is now?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, it's Mark, Tycho. So with regards to the Cell Systems business, we believe it's in sort of the mid- to high-single digits for the year. I mean you do see some of these quarter-to-quarter where we have a particularly strong quarter in Bioproduction with a couple of accounts. What we've done well in that is to be engaged early on in the process so these customers are scaling up in the media, in our other cell products. We're doing excellent scale up in that Bioproductions. That's where you're seeing the growth of that strategy really play out. In the stem cell area, we've been launching products and 1 example that Greg spoke about in the script was also getting more validation. And we see similarly there, as you begin to see some of the stem cell products also move into cell therapy, the opportunity for us to participate in the emergence of this cell therapy market, particularly moving into some of the Asian areas, we've been looking at opportunities there that will continue to drive that growth out of stem cell research, ultimately into cell therapy.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then, as we think about the kind of sequencing business, obviously some nice progress on the sample prep side there. I mean are you willing to give a box number for the installed base in the PTM at this point? And then can you talk on plans to improve accuracy? And maybe just any color on early mix of customers and plans to move into the clinic would be helpful, too.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes. So as we mentioned again, we're very pleased with the numbers we've got. It exceeded our plans for what we were expecting in Q1. So we're very pleased with the update. We don't want to break out the individual numbers, but we continue to see great traction. We're exceeding the performance specifications in terms of what we're expecting in terms of throughput of the chips as we've launched 314. We said it would be 10 megabases of data. We have customers getting over 20 megs and continuing to improve that. We're launching now the 316 and 318 chip at the end of the year. So great feedback from our customers that lead us into that area. As we go forward in the coming area, we certainly see the application to move into the more clinical area with the product. Part of that is simplifying the direction we've gone with the OneTouch, and that's made great progress. And we're just making tremendous progress as well with the accuracy. Particularly, 1 of the concerns is being getting accuracy at longer read lengths. And so, our single base pair accuracy is improving so that the 100 bases, we're already several times x greater accuracy than other next-generation systems at that read length, which is important to our customers. And then with this [indiscernible] product, we can improve the consensus, accuracy and calling. So I think you will see Molecular Biology and software improvements that will drive the accuracy ever higher.  It will get great adoption in the coming years in the clinical applications. We remain -- so far, seeing that CE actually remains the gold standard in validation. So the fit between Ion and CE is also very strong as we validate in those clinical applications some of the discoveries as CE remains the gold standard there.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then you called out Bead Based Separation, I guess, seeing for the first time in kind of the release, I mean anything to read into that, understand obviously what the products are, anything you're highlighting there intentionally?", "Eileen Pattinson", "No, that business -- we called that out because that business has achieved double-digit growth for the last several quarters, so it's a good growth driver for us in the Cell Systems business as well.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, I'll hop back in the queue.", "Mark Stevenson", "I worked on now a franchise, which is driving and embedded in many other products, in both in core diagnostic products and also the core research area.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Quintin Lai with Robert Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "The guidance that you gave, kind of pacing throughout the year in anticipation of acceleration, I think you already said part of it is just the headwinds abating. Qualitatively, how much do you expect from new products like PGM and then maybe licenses to impact you in the back of the year, and maybe give some color on that, please?", "Eileen Pattinson", "So in terms of our guidance, Quintin, in terms of acquisition and contribution, it's about 1 point for the full year. And as you know, Ion Torrent does roll off in the fourth and that will be organic revenue at that point. We haven't split out the contribution from new products any further than that. But as you see the ramp throughout the year, you'll see part of it is because of the -- we get over the comps in the first half of the year, which is a big piece of why you see the ramp from first half to second half, and then you layer on the contribution from new products such as Ion Torrent and some other areas and you get the pacing that we've laid out.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "All right. And then, operating expense was a little lower than what we were expecting in Q1. Were you able to, when you saw things going in March, were you able to move down maybe some of your spending like in R&D? And then off the rate that we see here in the first quarter, is that the new base we should be forecasting off of? Or will there be a sequential increase in that as business gets better?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, I think, yes, we did take a look of what the quarter looked like. We had some programs we're planning to -- in the terms of productivity, programs that we put in place at the beginning of the year. And as we have in previous years and previous quarters, we monitor our spending depending on what the business outlook is, mindful that we not do anything to impact long-term growth. So yes, we did manage expenses carefully in the first quarter. Going forward, I would expect that, as we have in other years, as the growth rate picks up, we will maintain our commitment to the bottom line growth and we'll invest or cut back accordingly.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Mark, can you just elaborate a little bit more on what are you getting in terms of the -- of the 10- and 20-megabase yield on the Ion Torrent, what's -- how much of the yield of that, the accuracy, is in the Q20, Q17 range?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, it's actually a distribution of runs. So we get hundreds of thousands of runs on a chip, and so what you see is our distribution that occurs where actually we're trending to the majority of those at Q20 or we even get quality scores above that. So as we improved the core Molecular Biology and as we improved the accuracy on the calling side, the accuracy gets better. So the majority of the runs are already at Q20 or above. And then we'll continue to see improvement in that. Again, remember a lot of people are using Q20 here and scores that single-pass accuracy that will be used on from any with CE. In many applications, we'll then get a consensus average which, of course, if we fall higher than Q20.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Great. And David, I got distracted for a moment when you're talking about the geographical growth in the space. Is there anything -- how did Europe do, Western Europe do, in this quarter?", "David Hoffmeister", "Western Europe actually did slightly better than it had been doing in the previous quarters. It was solidly middle digits, middle single-digit growth.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And what were the big changes from, I think, some of its weakness you saw there, or just people a little bit more comfortable with budgets or were there any projects that have been delayed? Just -- can you give a little, qualitative?", "David Hoffmeister", "I think it was in both of those types of things. I think that the primary thing is that people have settled down from where they were with concerns about the budgets last year, and spending has returned to normal levels.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "And then next question, do you intend to use all of your repurchase authority this year?", "David Hoffmeister", "We haven't committed to that at this point, but as I've said, we intend to -- we've historically been aggressive in our buyback program and I don't think anything is going to change.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Just curious, Mark, today where you think the R&D dollars tend to be focused primarily. Is 1/3 still in sequencing, and what about the remainder? And then if I move forward, remind us how you think about R&D productivity and how you've been performing against your internal metrics? Thanks a lot.", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, in terms of the breakdown of the spend, it's still pretty much about 1/3 is in sequencing, as we launch the 5500 product, as we scale up on the Ion Torrent platforms. So those 2 areas are getting investment. The secondary is across the sort of microbiology franchise, particularly as we refreshed the qPCR franchise as we're launching into digital PCR some of the innovations coming across there. And then the third area as we come in some of  the what we broadly describe as some of the bench top devices, and we have a series of those launches planned. They really continue to capture the consumables, run rate into those devices during the -- Our metric on the return as being -- using an IRR metric. As I think we said in the last Analyst Day, we're currently getting mid-teens and IRR and a return on net investment. And our goal is to push that up into the high-teens as we go on to the next couple of years here.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Maybe if I could add just a little bit more on Ion Torrent. Have you started shipping the 316 chips yet or when are those set to ship?", "Mark Stevenson", "The 316 is, with a couple of early access customers at the moment. We have them in our internal labs, and they'll be going into full shipment as we come to the end of the second quarter.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And given what you have in the installed base, are you willing or getting any kind of insight as to kind of what, there are daily or weekly run rate that you're getting on the PGM?", "Mark Stevenson", "Well, they really just started ramping up but we gave an estimate for the year on the consumable usage...", "Eileen Pattinson", "$80,000.", "Mark Stevenson", "$80,000 approximately a year, and we expect some pull-through from the units.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So you haven't seen anything as they have been more out in the field that would have you change that number?", "Mark Stevenson", "No, we've seen very rapid adoption, I mean, really the faster run time allows customers to iterate very fast, and we're continuing to see good adoption as we get the units in customers' hands.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just last one on this. On the -- for the 5% to 7% constant currency growth guidance in the second quarter, is the only acquisition in that number going to be Ion Torrent?", "Gregory Lucier", "Yes, it's the only 1 of any significant size.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. So David, are you willing to quantify the PCR royalty decline in the first quarter? And then I noticed you called it out the second quarter as well, any updated thoughts on kind of that royalty line for the year for 2011?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, we haven't broken it out by quarter, Jon. But what we have said is in 2011, the royalty decline is $20 million, associated with qPCR. As we've also said, we've got a group that last year, was able to more than offset the $15 million decline that we had last year. And so they're basically working away to try and offset it at this point. But I don't have anything that -- or prepared to issue publicly and then update at this stage.", "Eileen Pattinson", "Jon, well, this is Eileen. I can tell you that the decline that we had in Q1 was in line with our expectations.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thanks. Last one. David, the cash on the balance sheet, so I'm just thinking about the bond that could, or that may or may not be called. Is all -- relatively all of that $700 million or so, is that accessible by you guys at this point or are there foreign kind of repatriation issues with it?", "David Hoffmeister", "No, we don't have any foreign repatriation issues. We have about $18 million that's restricted, that's left over from some covenants associated with the applied Biosystems acquisition. But other than that, all of that cash is available to us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "On the Ion Torrent PGM, I was hoping you could just give us a little more detail in terms of the early customers that are buying or ordering the product. Is this market expansion that you're seeing or are these early adopters coming from the existing customer base?", "Mark Stevenson", "Yes, Amit, I think we've seen a mix of both. I mean we're seeing some of the large genome centers who have already called us, with instruments, that are interested to try the new technology. There is a part of the live rescreening or as part of validation or [indiscernible] technology that they already have. We're also seeing with smaller universities now democratizing this technology, they're getting into it, both here in the U.S. In Europe, we so a good uptake. We sold into some of the Latin American countries as well. So we're seeing an expansion of the market of next-generation sequencing. These are typically molecular biology labs that we may have visited already and were using perhaps PCR and other molecular biology but hadn't yet made the move into next-generation sequencing. They also, perhaps, might have been an already customer, being easier to use, and so we've seen that switch of [indiscernible] and the adoption of the next-generation sequencing in those newer customers to us.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "I mean, Mark, is it fair to say that right now, it's like 90% plus are existing customers, and the new market is still less than 10%?", "Mark Stevenson", "I would say, I mean, the existing customers to license, we have such a broad portfolio. The majority still probably had an existing next-generation system, but it wasn't as high as 90%. We had a number of -- and have a large pipeline of new customers to next-generation sequencing.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, thanks. And just a quick follow-up on food safety, is there -- can you just talk about what kind of impact you're seeing either in the U.S. or in Europe from food safety?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, it's been a good business for us. It had double-digit growth in the quarter, and we're investing in lots of new assays for that business.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Thanks for taking the question. First up, in Cell Systems, your growth there has obviously been in double-digits the last few quarters, as I think a few other people mentioned. I am wondering can you maybe spend a little more time there and identify if anything has really changed in the underlying volume or pricing dynamics in that business? As we look at the long term, you guys have guided sort of mid- to high-single-digits, so I am wondering if that is still the right way to look at the growth in that business?", "Gregory Lucier", "That business has benefited from, I'd say, the last 4 to 5 years of focusing very intently on key drugs in development and winning the media to be on those drugs, and we're now harvesting that work in that several drugs that have been approved. We are the media source for them. And so you're seeing that high double-digit growth now take place.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then maybe just looking over to the diagnostic side of the business, hasn't gotten a lot of focus on this call but certainly a sizeable area of interest. And if you look at sort of building it over time, how do you look at prioritizing the acquisition of either distribution reach or content -- versus content?", "Gregory Lucier", "Well, we realized that we will be building out the distribution reach for whether it's qPCR platform and then content or CE platform and content or we think Ion Torrent, as Mark was describing earlier, is going to be an important device in the clinic. We have a good, albeit, smaller-in-size base from which to build in that, our HLA business, and the AcroMetrix acquisition we made a bit ago, gives us some mass from which to build some sales management in each of the key regions. And so that's where we're investing through the year to build that overall sales force and that presence in the clinical diagnostics market.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got you, okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Thank you. I'll squeeze 1 in, plus 1 follow-up.  First question -- and I'll fit them in the same sentence. The first question, is it the correct read that you won't be breaking out organic revenue growth in the next couple of quarters? And then my follow-up, you mentioned that Genetic Systems, excluding the comparable issues in Japan, was flat in the quarter. Does that reflect a dramatic slow down in your CE business? And if so, has anything incrementally changed on that front?", "Gregory Lucier", "So, well, let me start and see if I can answer your questions. No, it doesn't mean that we will not be sharing organic revenue growth. We intend to share organic revenue growth going forward, just as we have in the past. In terms of Genetic Systems, that growth rate adjusted for unusual onetime items, and the impact of Japan was flat. Our CE business actually grew, again, adjusted for onetime items in the first quarter of last year and low-single digits, which was in line with what has been growing after the last several quarters.", "Daniel Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Eileen Pattinson", "All right. This concludes our first quarter earnings conference call. If there are any additional questions, please feel free to contact me. The webcast will be available via a replay on our website for 3 weeks. Thank you again for joining us this afternoon.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until May 20, 2011. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our first quarter 2011 earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we're off to a good start to the year, delivering double-digit growth in our primary financial metric, adjusted earnings per share. We achieved record first quarter EPS results and also expanded our adjusted operating margin through our ongoing focus on productivity. All in all, we had a solid performance in the quarter on top of the exceptional Q1 results we reported in 2010. This puts us in an excellent position to deliver on our goals for the full year.", "Let me review our first quarter highlights. As I said, adjusted EPS was a first quarter record, increasing by 12% to $0.92 per share. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 30 basis points to 17.6% in the quarter. Our investments in research and development continue to strengthen our depth of capabilities across our technology portfolio and we had an excellent quarter in that regard. I'll talk later about the new launches we highlighted at PITTCON in March.", "Growth in emerging markets was particularly strong in Q1. For example, we had greater than 20% growth in China and over 30% growth in India and Brazil. I've talked a lot about our continuing investments to expand our Asia-Pacific presence. During the quarter, we announced our plans to build a new factory in Suzhou to support China's focus on building out its R&D infrastructure. This will give us the capacity to produce laboratory consumables for growing local life sciences markets.", "I was in China the week they unveiled their 12 5-year plan and it's exciting to see how closely Thermo Fisher is aligned with their priorities in healthcare and life sciences, environmental protection, energy and public safety. I'd like to say a few words now on Japan, which represents about 3% of our total revenues. Although we don't have any manufacturing there, we do have extensive commercial operations in the country. Most important, we were relieved to learn that all 400 of our Japanese employees were safe. We also learned that we had no damage or significant interruption to our operations. I have to say that I'm extremely proud of how our leadership team in Japan responded to the crisis on all fronts. Concern and support for our employees was the first priority, then they made contingency plans for the business so we could continue to serve our customers.", "So despite the horrific situation, our Japan team managed through the quarter with no significant negative impact on performance. Our best view on the outlook for Japan at this point is that we don't see a material impact on our business, but we'll continue to watch the situation closely and of course, we'll take the appropriate actions as necessary.", "On a humanitarian note, we instituted a company match for our employees worldwide to make cash donations to the international Red Cross. We also immediately offered our personal radiation detectors and dosimeters to protect first responders and even the media during the early days following the disaster. Our handheld detectors were also used to screen food for radioactive contamination.", "So let me now turn to the key contributors to our performance this quarter. As I stated previously, delivering strong EPS results is our primary financial metric and we do that consistently by driving top line growth through continuous innovation and expansion in emerging markets, operational excellence and effective capital deployment. So first, I'll talk about top line revenue growth in the quarter.", "You've seen the negative headlines in the media over the past few months from the natural disasters in Asia-Pacific to the harsh winter in the U.S. and more recently, the U.S. government budget uncertainty. I am pleased to say that we powered through those headwinds by executing well operationally and by capitalizing on continued strength in our industrial and diagnostics end markets. As you saw in our press release, revenues grew 4% to a first quarter record of $2.72 billion compared with $2.63 billion a year ago. Our businesses serving the industrial sector are doing quite well, driven by demand for our Process Instruments. More specifically, sales of our handheld instruments continue to strengthen, along with our longer lead-time systems for the metals, mining and commodity materials industries.", "We've been highlighting the performance of our Clinical Diagnostics business for the past 2 quarters and I'm pleased to say that our share gains came again in Q1. We recorded double-digit growth here, driven by sales of our biomarker test kits. Our second EPS growth driver, operational excellence, continues to give us the ability to translate top line growth into excellent bottom line results. We have several productivity levers that we can pull to adjust to changing market dynamics and our teams continue to execute very well to consistently deliver solid margin expansion.", "As you know, PPI and PPI-Lean are ingrained in the way we run our company and we continue to leverage these programs to improve productivity and strengthen our global competitive position. During the quarter, I had the opportunity to participate in some of the daily standup meetings at our flagship laboratory equipment facility in Asheville, North Carolina. It's really impressive to see how PPI-Lean has had a profound impact on quality, product availability, cost and cash flow at this site. In addition, by implementing PPI-Lean, the Asheville team has been able to grow site capacity to keep pace with customer demand, while averting typical expansion costs. This is just 1 example of the intensity around productivity being demonstrated at many sites across our company. I'm very proud of our teams across the company and the commitment they demonstrate to PPI.", "Our third key contributor to EPS growth is effective capital deployment, and that continues to provide us with multiple avenues for creating shareholder value. We had a lot of activity recently in terms of capital management that will benefit us this year and over the long term. We sold our 2 laboratory testing services businesses, Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories, which generated total proceeds of approximately $940 million. We deployed $538 million to repurchase 9.6 million of our -- shares of our stock during the quarter and we also authorized an additional $750 million stock repurchase program and of that, we have $700 million remaining at the end of -- at the start of Q2.", "Let me make a couple of remarks on recent acquisitions. I've commented in previous quarters about the great contributions from our Ahura Scientific and B.R.A.H.M.S. acquisitions, and they continue to do very well. Roughly a year ago, we acquired Finnzymes and Fermentas. Both of these businesses expanded our offerings in high-growth markets for PCR-based testing and they delivered double-digit growth in the quarter.", "I'll also remind you -- I'd also like to remind you where we are with the Dionex acquisition. As we announced at the beginning of Q2, the European commission is reviewing our filing and we anticipate closing in mid-May. In the meantime, the integration planning teams from both companies have been actively engaged and are preparing for day 1. We are excited about the opportunities this combination will bring to our customers in growing markets around the world, particularly applied markets such as environmental analysis, water testing and food safety.", "So we're focused on accelerating our long-term growth and strengthening our industry leadership by effectively deploying our cash and putting our balance sheet to work. I'd like to now highlight a key growth theme within the company, as I've done in the past few quarters. The intent here is to demonstrate how our ongoing investments broaden the growth opportunities for Thermo Fisher by collectively driving our revenue growth, leveraging our unique depth of capabilities across the company and fulfilling our mission which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. Today, the theme is commitment to continuous innovation. I've talked in the past about how we maintain our level of R&D spend through the economic recession. I am pleased to say that we're starting to reap the benefits of that decision now. For example, we showcased a range of innovative new instruments at PITTCON in March. As I walked the show floor, it was clear that our customers recognize Thermo Fisher as the only company with the depth of capabilities in technologies and applications expertise to help them solve a broad range of analytical challenges. Let me highlight some of the new products under our Thermo Scientific brand that stood out this year.", "We're known for our leadership in mass spectrometry-based analysis and we continue to innovate there so our customers can spend less time performing experiments and more quickly draw conclusions from the results. Take our Thermo Scientific Exactive ultra-high resolution LC/MS system which is used for non-targeted screening to determine, for example, whether or not an Olympic athlete is using performance-enhancing drugs. In the past, a sample would have been analyzed multiple times. First to screen for known compounds, followed by a second experiment to identify unknown compounds such as new drug metabolites and then typically a third time to determine the quantity of compounds of interest such as a designer steroid. We've introduced the new ExactFinder software to help our customers handle and interpret the large amounts of data generated during this type of complex analysis. When used with our Exactive mass spectrometer, all of these experiments can be conducted at the same time and in 1 run. In addition, because all the information in the sample is recorded and archived, you can go back and reanalyze the data to find new compounds of interest. ", "This powerful combination gives customers much faster access to qualitative and quantitative data for both drug screening and confirmation.", "Turning to chemical analysis, we continue to broaden the applications for our comprehensive molecular spectroscopy offering, including UV-Vis, Raman and FT-IR by developing more compact user-friendly products. 1 of the headliners at PITTCON in this category was our new Thermo Scientific iS5, a smaller and lighter version of our leading iS10 FT-IR instrument, which we introduced a couple of years ago. The iS5's rugged construction means that the instrument can safely be moved closer to the sample without compromising performance, for example, positioning it near a production line to be used by a quality assurance team. Despite its compact size, the iS5's performance is comparable to larger instruments found in most analytical labs.", "We also introduced a whole new line of portable instruments, the Thermo Scientific Niton XFL, which is a fully equipped x-ray analyzer that can be deployed in the field. It's typically used for mining and exploration, as well as quality testing for consumer goods and electronics. The 30-pound unit can sit on a back of a truck or be mounted on a tripod to create an on-site lab that provides fast and precise elemental analysis.", "So innovation will always be critical to our growth and we are committed to make investments that will strengthen our position as the technology leader. Let me also tell you that I'm really, really excited about the new mass spectrometry launches we have planned for ASMS this year which you'll hear about in June. So before I wrap up, let me give you an update on our annual guidance for 2011. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS outlook. The new guidance includes the acquisition of Dionex with the assumption of a mid-May close and now excludes the Athena and Lancaster businesses, which we sold at beginning of Q2. We are raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $4.05 to $4.15 for the full year in 2011. This would result in 17% to 20% growth over our strong results in 2010. ", "We're also raising our revenue guidance for the year and now expect to achieve 2011 revenues in the range of $11.52 billion to $11.62 billion for 9% to 10% revenue growth over 2010. ", "Before I hand the call over to Pete, let me summarize my remarks this morning with a few key points. We remain focused on continuing our track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We successfully executed our plans, even in the face of some unexpected headwinds to deliver solid first quarter performance. I'm excited about our prospects for the year and our results in Q1 put us in great position to achieve our goals for growth. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc mentioned, in early April, we closed on the divestitures on our 2 laboratory testing service businesses, Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories, for total proceeds of $940 million. Financial results for these 2 businesses are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented, so they are excluded from my comments.", "We're pleased to report another quarter of strong adjusted earnings per share, with 12% year-over-year growth to a first quarter record of $0.92 compared to $0.82 last year. GAAP EPS in Q1 was $0.64, up 14% from $0.56 in the prior year's quarter.", "Moving on to our top line performance. Reported revenues increased 4% year-over-year to a first quarter record $2.72 billion. Organic revenue growth was 1%, excluding a 2% benefit from acquisitions and a 1% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. In the quarter, the Japan stimulus and Biosite transition headwinds that we previously mentioned negatively affected our organic growth by about $80 million or 3%. Excluding these 2 items, our Q1 organic growth was 4%, which was in line with our expectations.", "We also continued to strengthen our backlog this quarter with bookings exceeding revenues by 2%.", "By segment, Analytical Technologies' Q1 revenues grew 9% on a reported basis and 5% organically. Excluding the Japan stimulus headwind, organic growth in this segment was 10%, driven by another strong quarter in Clinical Diagnostics, specifically our Biomarkers business. Our Instruments businesses serving industrial and applied markets also continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 revenues grew 1% on a reported basis and declined 1% organically. Our growth this quarter was in line with our expectations, taking into account the Biosite transition and our strong growth in Q1 last year. In the quarter, our BioPharma Services business had strong growth and we had good contribution from flu, which helped offset some budget-related delays in academic and government end markets.", "By geography, we saw low single-digit growth in Europe and North America was essentially flat, primarily as a result of the Biosite transition and particularly strong growth in Q1 2010. Asia was down slightly, but grew in the low-teens if you exclude the Japan stimulus impact driven by strong growth in China and India, as Marc mentioned. Rest of the world grew in the mid-double digits from a relatively small base driven by Brazil and the Middle East.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, we had strong bottom line results with Q1 adjusted operating income increasing 5% year-over-year to $478 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.6%, up 30 basis points from 17.3% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by organic growth pull through and strong cost productivity from our PPI and PPI-Lean projects, global sourcing initiatives and ongoing restructuring actions. These gains were partially offset by the strategic investments in R&D and commercial resources that we initiated last year to drive future growth.", "By segment, Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased by 11% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 21%, up 40 basis points versus 20.6% last year, driven by pull through on organic volume growth, the benefits of global sourcing and productivity and moderately higher prices.", "Turning to our Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 adjusted operating income decreased slightly year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 13.7%, down 20 basis points from the year-ago quarter. In this segment, solid productivity was offset by pull through on the organic volume decline and strategic growth investments.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 42.5% in Q1, up 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter. This margin expansion was driven by a pull through on organic revenue growth and the benefits of our global sourcing and strong cost productivity actions.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 22.2% of revenue, flat to the year-ago quarter. And R&D expense was 2.75% of revenue in Q1, up about 25 basis points from last year.", "Moving below the line, our Q1 net interest expense increased $3 million year-over-year to $23 million, driven primarily by higher interest expense as a result of issuing $2.2 billion of senior notes to prefund our pending acquisition of Dionex, partially offset by higher interest income. Adjusted other income was a gain of $1 million, up $4 million from last year, primarily as a result of lower currency transaction losses on foreign entity cash.", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 20.5%, down 50 basis points from last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the extension of the R&D tax credit into 2011. As Marc mentioned, we authorized an additional $750 million of share repurchases this quarter on top of the $488 million we had remaining on our previous authorization. During the quarter, we deployed $538 million of our cash to buy back 9.6 million shares, which left $700 million remaining at the quarter end under our current authorization through February 2012.", "Average diluted shares were $395 million in the quarter, down $23 million or 6% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 and 2011 share buyback programs, as well as redemption of our convertible debt. ", "Turning to the balance sheet. Free cash flow from continuing operations was $263 million in the quarter after deducting net capital expenditures of $63 million. This was down about $24 million from the year-ago quarter, primarily as a result of tax payment timing and moderately higher capital expenditures.", "We ended the quarter with $2.8 billion in cash and investments, up $1.9 billion from Q4. This increase resulted from the Dionex acquisition prefunding and our free cash flow, partially offset by share buybacks. Our total debt was $4.3 billion, up $2.2 billion from Q4 as a result of the Dionex acquisition prefunding. ", "And early in Q2, we used $415 million in cash to redeem the remaining 300 million of our outstanding convertible debt. This activity will be reflected in our Q2 ending cash and debt balances.", "Now moving on to our guidance for 2011 which now includes the Dionex acquisition and excludes the Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories divestitures. We're raising both the low- and high-end of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.05 to a new range of $4.05 to $4.15, which represents 17% to 20% growth over our 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.46. In terms of revenue, we're tightening the range by $20 million and raising the midpoint by $180 million to a new range of $11.52 billion to $11.62 billion. This range represents growth of 9% to 10% compared to our 2010 reported revenues of $10.57 billion.", "I'd like to provide you some additional color on our new guidance, as there are a lot of pluses and minuses compared to our previous guidance. First, as I mentioned, Athena and Lancaster had been classified as discontinued operations, so they've been removed from our guidance and continuing operations financials in all current and historical periods. For 2010, this results in a reduction of $220 million in our reported revenues from $10.79 billion to $10.57 billion and a reduction of $0.11 to our adjusted EPS from $3.57 to $3.46. For 2011, this results in a reduction of our previous revenue guidance by about $240 million and our adjusted EPS guidance by about $0.13. ", "In terms of the Dionex acquisition it has not yet closed, but we're expecting it to close in mid-May so we've assumed this in our guidance. Adding Dionex from mid-May onward adds about $310 million of revenue or 3% and $0.09 to our adjusted EPS. ", "Favorable foreign currency translation compared to our previous guidance also adds about $100 million to our revenue and $0.03 to our adjusted EPS. This results in a total impact of favorable foreign currency about 1.75% on our 2011 revenue growth. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future currency exchange rates.", "And finally, we expect about $0.06 accretion from accelerating our share buyback activity into Q1 and utilizing our new $750 million share buyback authorization to February 2012. So all this nets to the $0.05 increase in adjusted EPS and $180 million increase in reported revenues. ", "In terms of organic revenue growth, the midpoint of our revenue guidance remains unchanged at about 4% growth. We still expect our growth to accelerate throughout the year with Q2 at the lower end of mid-single-digit growth and the second half of the year high higher as comparisons get easier.", "In addition to Dionex, our reported revenue guidance includes about 1% growth from completed acquisitions and does not include any other future acquisitions or divestitures. To give you a little more detail on our earnings guidance, we're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion of 65 to 95 basis points compared to our 2010 adjusted operating margin of 17.4% after restating for the Athena and Lancaster divestitures. This is consistent with our previous guidance of 50 to 80 basis points of margin expansion, plus the expected accretion from the Dionex acquisition. ", "Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be up about $45 million to $50 million year-over-year, reflecting the incremental interest cost related to the Dionex acquisition. Our adjusted income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 20% to 21%, which is down 1% from our previous range as a result of removing Athena and Lancaster from our rate and tax synergies related to Dionex. And our full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $385 million to $390 million. This estimate reflects the redemption of our convertible debt early in Q2 and assumes that we'll use the remaining $700 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration in February 2012. ", "So in summary, we're pleased to start off the year with a strong quarter, providing us positive momentum that positions us well to achieve our 2011 goals. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So as we think about sort of the progression of the end markets, I mean, Mark, you provided some brief commentary on some of the pockets of sort of strength and relative weakness. I was hoping maybe you could dive in a little bit more. It seems like the emerging markets, the applied and industrial continue to kind of be the net winners for the business and then you've got a few pieces maybe that have lagged. Maybe highlight relevant to kind of your internal expectations where the largest deltas were and in terms of for the outlook, where you have the highest degree of confidence in what markets maybe you are kind of watching the most closely and kind of keeping an eye on.", "Marc Casper", "In terms of end markets, let's go through the 4 markets, starting with industrial and applied. Look, clearly industrial and applied markets are very strong and we're seeing benefits in the area such as food safety and QA/QC and other routine testing which is served by our molecular elemental spectroscopy instruments. We're also beginning to really see significant strength in bookings and revenue of our later cycle products, which is what we expected to happen, areas like the mining industry, those manufacturing commodities such as steel and cement are really picking up substantially. From a healthcare and diagnostics perspective, the second of the end markets, our Specialty Diagnostics business is continuing to do very well, in particular the Clinical Diagnostics business, and our Biomarkers business is continuing to enjoy and deliver share gains. We also benefited in the quarter from a stronger flu season than the 2010 period. From an academic and government perspective, really what was unusual in the quarter was the U.S. government working under the continuing resolution authority and clearly that headwind is behind us. So the good news is through all that budgeting process in the U.S, there really wasn't any major changes to the budgets and 1 of the positives is that the food safety budget actually got slightly better. So that's encouraging for the midterm. And we're expecting more of a normalized set of market conditions in government and academic for the balance of the year. In BioPharma in the quarter, conditions were very similar to what we saw at the end of last year, which was in line with what we expected. The BioPharma end market was softer than our company average, mostly due to the very difficult comparison of about 20% growth in Q1 of last year. And within the BioPharma customers set, our BioPharma Services business and our Scientific Instruments business had really strong performance with those customers in the quarter.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "Okay. That's helpful. I mean, we spent a lot of the latter half of last year kind of contemplating cash flow utilization and sort of the balance sheet and getting to optimal debt levels and then you now significantly uptick kind of your activity there, you've been quite aggressive with buying the stock. I mean, do you feel like the pace at which we've seen kind of the capital deployment and sort of the consistency on the buyback side is sort of something that we should assume continues on into the future and in turn we're now kind of that you've gotten comfortable in your seat as sort of the CEO and gotten the confidence of the board, we're back to kind of the Legacy Thermo which was clearly known for its excellent capital deployment capabilities?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. From my perspective, I think the company has a really strong track record of generating cash flow and deploying it wisely and that's going to be a mix of M&A and return of capital. And we're trying to be consistent on the return of capital and then when the right M&A that meets our criteria that can create shareholder value is available, we'll pursue it because we have confidence in our ability to deliver there. We did a onetime acceleration, if you will, in Q1 simply because we sold 2 assets. We had $900-plus million of proceeds and we put an incremental authorization in to deploy a lot of that capital. But I think you should of it as we did $750 million authorization for the balance of this year and we have $700 million remaining, and we'll spend that during the course of the next 10 or 11 months.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "Great, Marc. Thanks.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from the line of Marshall Urist with Morgan Stanley.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks for taking the questions. First one, just, Marc, can you maybe talk about the book-to-bill? Obviously, that seemed positive in the quarter and if we can just get a sense of where that was strongest across the different end markets, just to give us a sense of momentum. And I know you mentioned it earlier, but maybe on the academic end markets side, have you already seen that sort of start to normalize so far in the quarter?", "Peter Wilver", "Marshall, this is Pete. So on the book-to-bill, as I said, bookings exceeded revenues by about 2%. Both segments were positive there, the Analytical Technologies was a little bit stronger than Laboratories Products and Services, but both had positive book-to-bill. We really don't track that metric by end market but certainly, you would have to believe that the industrial end market is driving that, some of the longer cycle businesses are in that end market, so they're going to drive a book-to-bill above 1, driving future revenue growth.", "Marc Casper", "And very qualitatively, because it's obviously early in the quarter, some of the hesitancy in the U.S. on academic and government because of budget uncertainty, the qualitative feedback is that seems to be behind us and customers are getting back to a more normalized situation. It's early, but that's the read.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great, thanks. I appreciate that it's so early. And then maybe just on Dionex and I realize it hasn't been closed, but if you could maybe talk a little bit more detail about operationally from the top line to -- end markets have obviously been strong in the markets where Dionex is. So what are your assumptions on that business as you think about the rest of the year? And maybe what are the kind of pressure points that you're thinking about that could sort of move it one way or the other?", "Marc Casper", "So we're looking forward to day 1 and right now it continues to look like it'll be a mid-May close, which is what we've assumed in the guidance. From a -- as we've gone through the integration planning and looking at the outlook for the year, we feel very good about the $0.13 to $0.15 of earnings that we expect from an accretion perspective over the first 12 months of ownership. So when we -- we've gone now with the benefit of several months of very detailed integration planning. We feel very good about our ability to deliver that and in the guidance that Pete walked through in a fair amount of detail, that's embedded for the period of ownership that we have. So we feel very good about what's going on with Dionex and how that's going to be integrated into the company and we're looking forward to closing and getting going.", "Marshall Urist - Morgan Stanley", "Okay, great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Thanks for taking the question. Could you maybe, Marc, I know you don't like to get into too much detail, but would you mind providing a little detail on what you think about the pacing for the year, specifically with respect to Lab Products and Services, how you kind of would expect that to develop after a tougher [indiscernible] comp and in the Biosite standpoint?", "Marc Casper", "So here's for sure, your question is a little bit broken up, Jon. So is the question the pacing for Lab Products and Services through the balance of the year?", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Yes, yes. I mean, you talked high-level about how you thought 2Q overall would be at the lower end of the mid-single and get a little bit better. And I'm just kind -- I'm trying to -- this is -- the Lab Products and Services business is one that seems to be tougher for people to get a handle on for a lot of different reasons. So I'm just -- just if you could maybe help us understand how you expect that business to play out.", "Peter Wilver", "Hi, Jon, this is Pete. So in terms of organic revenue growth, so we reported 1% in Q1 which means that we need to be basically mid-single digits or around 5% average for the last 3 quarters of the year in order to get to the midpoint of our guidance of 5%. Certainly for the year, Analytical Technologies is going to be stronger than the average and Laboratory Products and Services is going to be a little bit lower than the average, just as a result of some of the comp issues that we have. In terms of Q2, I'm expecting positive organic growth in both segments and then it will accelerate into Q3 and Q4.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. That's helpful. I guess one question that I often get is Lab Products and Services, if you go back -- way back to the Fisher, I mean, it used to be a pretty consistent business at kind of the mid-single-digit. Here we're in 2011, I recognize some particular headwinds, but is there anything that's changed from an end market standpoint that you think that is now a kind of a structurally lower growth business then maybe it was over the previous years kind of before the 2009 period?", "Marc Casper", "No. We feel very good about the prospects. In fact I think 1 of the challenges for people to analyze is that we're so unique because of our leadership position. There's just nobody that has those set of capabilities. And it's a great business that has good growth prospects and has good earnings prospects. We made some decisions, things like Biosite, and we've talked in the past where a decision where the company's going to generate better cash flows and effectively -- better to have a smaller core set of suppliers where we're going to make more money than have a large supplier where you don't make any money on. So it's been unfortunately 4 quarters of discussing a headwind, we're down to 1 to go, but the reality is it's a great business and we're very positive about what the outlook is for it.", "Jonathan Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Thanks a million.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Thanks for taking the questions. You guys have had, in your words, several months of integration efforts behind you in the context of the Dionex deal. Any thoughts you can share on the outlook beyond 2011? When would you expect to see some sales synergy opportunities really present themselves? And how long do you think you're going to need to invest in integration efforts? I guess I'm just trying to get at when might we expect more meaningful accretion related to this deal?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, Doug, when you look at the planning efforts that are underway, they cover everything from how the businesses will be integrated to the cost side, as well as what you have to do to capitalize on the revenue opportunities. You'll see a little bit of revenue synergies towards the end of the first 12 months of ownership. They become more meaningful in years 2 and 3 of ownership and we're highly confident in our ability to deliver that. Obviously, the synergies ramp up in years 2 and 3, so that drives incremental accretion. And as does -- the business is a healthy growing business and a healthy growing business is also going to expand earnings. So it's a business that's going to create a nice tailwind for the company for many, many years to come, just be giving us growth and margin profiles and synergies. So when we get to guidance for '12, which is a ways away, we'll obviously articulate sort of how, to the best of our ability, how that's contributing to the growth. But obviously, that will be a nice positive looking at next year as well.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. And then maybe just pivoting to an end market question. We're still pretty early in earnings season. Some others in the group where you have some overlap but obviously not -- comprehensive overlap have talked more positively about the pharmaceutical end market. You maybe not did it -- it doesn't sound like you did as well as you normally do there, which you pointed to the comps as really the primary reason. But beyond that, was there anything unusual in the quarter, I mean, typically in mass spec or any other area you want to speak about? Anything unexpected or outside the norm?", "Marc Casper", "So when you look at BioPharma, the 2 highlights for us that we called out, and I think they're important, is our BioPharma Services business, which is really clinical trial outsourcing, really had a good quarter. So that's encouraging, because in the development cycle for our pharmaceutical customers, activity is picking up. So we feel good about that. And our Scientific Instruments business did really well. So that would sort of just give you a sense of mass spec and [indiscernible] those things had a really nice quarter. Everything else is pretty much consistent with what we've seen in the past and really here it's a comp, right? You have 20% growth here in the prior year periods. So it's a pretty difficult comp. So that's how we think about it.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays Capital.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks very much. Marc, staying with the same theme in BioPharma, do you feel that the instrumentation placements, the analytical instruments in the BioPharma business were actually replacements? Are these orders for new instruments or additive instruments? Then that I have 1 follow-up.", "Marc Casper", "So it's a little hard to know definitively, but I think our view is it's mostly that our customers like the technology and are adding the technology, because a lot of our instruments are truly just fundamentally different than previous generations. The Exactive mass spectrometer, there isn't a predecessor. I'm sure there's some other set of mass spectrometers in the past that they're replacing, but I kind of intellectually think about it as new technology being adapted.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thank you. And my follow-up then is also on Dionex. Are you keeping the brand, or does the brand become Thermo Fisher and then what physically do you call the Dionex facilities at Thermo Fisher or will it remain Dionex? Thanks very much.", "Marc Casper", "So I love the question, because it's one that we always spend a lot of time internally about as an industry leader. The branding for our products after an orderly transition will be a Thermo Scientific Dionex IC instrument. So it's always -- the brand is always Thermo Scientific on our technologies. Dionex will be a product name so that you don't lose the linkage to the past. But we want to drive the cross-selling synergies across with mass spec and elemental analysis and molecular spectroscopy, so you've got a link to Thermo Scientific. And day 1, every site will have a Thermo Fisher Scientific sign as they do everywhere else in our 300-plus sites around the world. And I know that I'll be at one of the main sites on day one welcoming our employees to the company as will other members of our Executive team around the world. So that one's pretty straightforward.", "Charles Butler - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, Marc.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "First question. On some of the incremental investments that you talked about both SG&A and R&D, maybe starting with SG&A, you've obviously talked about expanding the footprint in Asia. Can you just give us an update as to where we are in the process? And the same tone on R&D, you talked about getting some traction from some of that incremental investment this year. Should we assume that Analytical Technologies kind of accelerates in the back half of the year as a result?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, Tycho, thanks for the question. This is a very important one. Let me start with the R&D question, because we chose the words incredibly specifically here in my comments, which is really what you saw in March of 2011 was the benefits of the decision in 2009 to maintain our R&D spend. There's a real lead time to develop your next-generation and breakthrough instrumentation. So we made a decision that wasn't necessarily popular, but we felt it was the right decision at the time to really hold our R&D spend at that period. You're seeing the benefits of those decisions now. In 2010 and 2011, we've increased our R&D and you should start to see the benefits of that kind of very end of this year. But really 2012, 2013 is when those decisions that ramp up start to affect our growth rates. So that's how the R&D plays out. Commercially, we've talked about investments in Asia-Pacific and we talked about some IT/web type investments on the SG&A perspective. And clearly, you saw a nice quarter in emerging markets, which is an area that we are benefiting with 20-plus percent growth in China and 30% plus growth in India and Brazil. And we're continuously redeploying our SG&A. We're moving it from lower return areas to higher return areas and we're getting that, so we're starting to cap off the SG&A spend so that really becomes redeploying the best opportunities.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. That's helpful. And then 1 for Pete. Can you talk about where your cash is now, net of kind of the Dionex financing or where it will be post close of the deal?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. In terms of our cash at the end of the quarter, we were sitting with $2.8 million. Obviously, we need to use about $2.1 billion of that to achieve the Dionex acquisition. So we'll be back down to kind of normal levels between something around $500 million.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "I was asking U.S. versus OUS.", "Peter Wilver", "Well, obviously it's mostly U.S., but it's either U.S. or pretty readily accessible foreign. So most of our cash right now, it's about 70% U.S. cash.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then last one, I guess. With that in mind, appetite for kind of tucked-in deals here and other technology acquisitions, is that still a priority?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. The way we think about it is we always have a pipeline of deals. We use our criteria to make sure that those deals are attractive and generate shareholder returns. As I've said in the past, Dionex for instance, only affects 1 of our businesses, only 1 of our dozen divisions within the company. So we have plenty of management capacity, we have financial capacity, but we're very disciplined. We look at a lot of things and we walk away from things that don't meet our criteria and those deals that really squarely fit down with our criteria, we're more than willing to do.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "First question for Pete. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment globally and across the different business units? And also talk about any issues you're seeing with increased commodity pricing across your product line.", "Peter Wilver", "Sure. In terms of pricing, it's pretty consistent with what we saw in 2010. On consumables, where we're seeing reasonable price increases, we got more price in our Analytical Technology segment on the higher-end instruments and consumables than we did in Laboratory Products and Services. But again, that's pretty consistent with what we saw in 2010 and we netted positive price in Q1. And in terms of inflation the 1 area we're seeing, we're obviously impacted by the increase in oil prices. The main impact there is on our resin cost and plastics. That's not a huge raw material purchase for us, but it did impact us in the quarter and we expect it to impact us for the rest of the year. It ends up not being overly material and in Q1 and for the rest of the year, we expect our global sourcing initiatives to pretty significantly outpace our inflation impact.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay, great. And just a question on Dionex. I wonder if you could just elaborate a little bit more on the European commission that you still need to take place and your confidence in this mid-May close, since the timing of the close has moved around a lot a little bit.", "Marc Casper", "Yes. Basically, they have accepted our filing, which is an important milestone, and they are evaluating it and our expectation is a mid-May close and that's really our best view at this point.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "When did they accept that filing?", "Marc Casper", "I don't have it memorized over the last few days, but what I know is it was a couple of weeks ago, right?", "Peter Wilver", "5 weeks before. In May.", "Marc Casper", "5 weeks before. But it's -- we've stacked into the date based on the process.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "So for the earnings guidance that I think you guys updated, I just want to make sure the math's right. I think you said negative $0.13 hit from the divestitures, maybe $0.09 add back for Dionex and then $0.03 for FX and $0.03 from accelerated share buybacks. So if I'm doing my math right, that's not quite the $0.05 you guys raised the guidance range by. So did I miss something there?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. It's $0.06 for the accelerated share buybacks. You got the other numbers correct.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then just, Marc, secondly on pharma end market, could you to talk about your level of visibility in that end market this year given the active M&A environment? And then maybe secondly, do you see an opportunity to get some larger consolidated contracts up for bid this year and therefore get a little bit of market share?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. Our teams -- in terms of visibility, it's pretty consistent with the past. Most of what we do with BioPharma is consumables, just given the scale of those customers. And so it's fairly consistent and fairly predictable. In terms of we're always looking for opportunities to grow share and grow profitability and there'll be some opportunities. But things don't move quickly in terms of big share gain one way or the other. But we have a good pipeline of activities is the way I would characterize it.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Awesome. And then just 1 last 1 of the biomarkers shrink you saw in the quarter. How significant was the contribution from the substance product from B.R.A.H.M.S?", "Marc Casper", "It's doing very well. I mean, it's a meaningful driver of growth. But that whole part of the business Clinical Diagnostics, which is our specialty assays, drugs of abuse and all of the different chemistry and immunoassay products, really broadly did well but the biomarkers and substance is doing really strong -- is really strong in performing.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "It caught my eye the talk about opening up a new facility in China. It looks like that it's kind of a make in China, sell in China strategy. Marc, could you kind of elaborate on what type of products that you expect to be making there? And is it an opportunity to maybe start making in China to sell worldwide in the future?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, Quintin, in terms of our strategy in China, I think it's well understood what our strategy there is which is use our scale to a significant advantage in serving the Chinese market. So we have multiple applications lab, we hire out of the best universities, we have a number of factories, we do local R&D, we have a division headquarter there. So we have really unique capabilities in China. What the new facility is, is a little bit of a different animal than what we have currently, which is this facility is for lab consumables, primarily plastic ware for life science research for the Chinese market. So if you go in -- I think you've actually been to our instrument and manufacturing facility in China, a lot of those products are used in China, but a lot of those products are used for global export as well. If you go to our glass facility in China, a lot of it's for China and a lot of it's for global export. We see the market growth opportunities so meaningfully in China for lab consumables on the plastics side that we believe we can support a full facility just for local consumption. So it's a little bit of a different angle, but we have a lot of manufacturing presence and experience in the region and have good confidence that this will be a nice driver of growth and profitability in the midterm.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Great. And then, Pete, did you -- maybe I missed it, but did you update cash flow guidance for the year?", "Peter Wilver", "I did not, but it's consistent with our previous guidance of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Excellent. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Quintin stole my question. So, Pete, that $0.09 of Dionex accretion, that I would imagine that excludes the negative carry up until May on the financing. Is that correct?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, it does. That's the net impact of adding it from May onwards with the related debt for that period.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. And 1 for Marc on the M&A side. Just on you guys' appetite, do you think that the organization could handle another transaction of a similar size as Dionex within, say, 6 months of close or do you think it's more likely that there would just be the tuck-ins for the next few quarters as you integrate Dionex?", "Marc Casper", "From an M&A perspective, yes. I mean, the company has the managerial capacity to do another similar size transaction to Dionex as long as it wasn't in routine Scientific Instruments, right? I think that, that would be too much of a stress. But anything else that we do in the company, we have the capacity. So Bioscience, Specialty Diagnostics, other parts of Scientific Instruments or other parts of the company, management is unaffected by the Dionex integration. So that's not a constraint. But again, any M&A we do is going to meet our criteria, strengthen the company strategically and really increasing the value for our customers and obviously, generating meaningful shareholder returns.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Marc, I just wondered if you could talk through the conditions in Europe. How you're looking at the market at the moment?", "Marc Casper", "Europe is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the past couple of quarters, grew low-single digits organically, Germany is doing pretty well. So that's obviously given the importance of the economy. France is doing pretty well. So we're cautiously optimistic with Europe and at the same point, it's very much in line with what we were expecting when we put our original guidance together.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "And then a similar question for Asia. Which country is growing fastest there and which product lines?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of Asia, China and India have really good momentum, so that's very encouraging. That's been across the board in terms of strength across the portfolio. So I feel very good about that. Obviously, Japan had a big headwind with the big stimulus order, so that is a drag and -- but that obviously sunsets already. It was a 1-quarter effect.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Finally, on the academic market, what's the tone from customers at the moment for you?", "Marc Casper", "I think the tone is relief that the budgets are now settled and that the changes to the budgets in the U.S., particularly with the continuing resolution really made customers nervous, is behind us. So I think there was traumatic changes one way or the other to the budgets, and I think customers are getting back to a more normalized environment.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay. Thanks so much, Marc.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam with Gleacher & Company.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Just one quick question. Do you guys consider the assumption for this year, given that you're providing guidance including Dionex? Is it pretty much in line with your prior guidance or are there any updates to that?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of the Dionex, the $0.09 that Pete articulated for the period that we own is consistent with the $0.13 to $0.15 that we originally announced over the first 12 months of ownership. And that is consistent with the synergies that we assume at the time of the deal. Now that we've gotten through most of the integration planning, we are comfortable and confident in our ability to deliver the synergies that we articulated at the time of the announcement. And we've done a lot of planning work with that regard. So we feel good about our ability to achieve the accretion numbers and the return numbers that we talked about at the time of the announcement.", "Sung Ji Nam - Gleacher & Company, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "You last question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with UBS.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "So going back to the question that was asked earlier on just the LPS grow rates. I just want to kind of -- if you could give a little bit more color on that. I mean, Lab Products and Services, it's customer channel, BioPharma Services and Lab Products. Could you just give -- I mean, you mentioned the BioPharma Services was strong. Could you talk a little bit about just the Customer Channels business and the Lab Products business? I mean, particularly, obviously, the comps have a bigger impact on the Customer Channels business than the other 1. Could you talk a little bit more qualitatively about that? I just think probably a little bit more color on those particular segments would make -- I think it will give people a little bit more comfort on the trajectory.", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, Derik, thanks for the question. I'll make a couple of quick remarks. 1 is the headwinds that we powered through in the quarter in terms of things like weather and government uncertainty clearly affect consumable businesses more than they affect Analytical Technologies. So the company powered through that. I feel very good about our execution, but that's going to sit a little bit more in Lab Products and Services from Q1 than it will obviously going forward, because we don't believe those are recurring in nature. That's the first thing. And then obviously, Biosite sits in our Customer Channels business and that creates a headwind in Q1 and Q2. If I look at the business and the fundamentals of how Customer Channels, how Lab Products as well as BioPharma Services business is executing, I feel good about it. So I feel good about the outlook, I feel good about the guidance that we're giving this year in terms of our top line growth. So I think our prospects here are good.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Okay. What is the dollar headwind in Q2 on Biosite?", "Marc Casper", "That's the last time we'll ever talk about it. So it is what, Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes. The net number is about $25 million.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Great. And at what point in time should we take the convert out of the share count?", "Peter Wilver", "It basically was redeemed right at the beginning of Q2.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS Investment Bank", "Great. Thanks.", "Marc Casper", "Thank you. So let me just wrap it up with a couple of quick remarks. So I'm pleased with our good start to the year and the excellent operational performance of our teams. With another excellent and good growth and adjusted EPS and the quarter behind us, we're very well positioned to deliver on our goals for 2011 and we're continuing our track record of strong EPS growth. I'd like to thank you for your interest in Thermo Fisher and I look forward, along with Pete, on updating you at the end of the second quarter on our progress for the year.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until August 19, 2011. A copy of the press release of the second quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "With that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for our second quarter 2011 earnings call. We're pleased to deliver another quarter of solid performance. As we discussed at the Analyst Meeting back in May, we're focused on consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth, and we continued our excellent track record with 22% growth in Q2. I want to thank our teams across the company who worked hard to meet this goal and contributed to our outstanding results. Our commitment to investing in new products and emerging markets is clearly paying off and our performance in Q2 positions us well to achieve our ambitious goals for the year.", "Let me get right into our second quarter financial highlights. Our adjusted EPS was $0.99, a second quarter record. We also achieved record revenue in the quarter with a 12% increase to $2.90 billion. Our adjusted operating margin increased 40 basis points to 17.6%, reflecting our continued investments to develop new products, expanding growing markets, and strengthen our commercial capabilities worldwide.", "You heard me talk about our EPS growth strategy in the context of our 3 key drivers. They are top line growth through continuous new product innovation and expansion in emerging markets; operational excellence; and deploying our capital to create shareholder value. We run the company by focusing on these key drivers, so I'll continually use them as a framework for my comments around the highlights this quarter.", "First, let me cover revenue growth. As I just mentioned, we had double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, and I'll give you a little color on which businesses stood out in terms of their contribution to our top line performance. Similar to what we've seen for the past few quarters, we continue to reap the benefits of strong industrial and applied markets served by a number of our businesses. In particular, our Process Instruments business performed very well across the board, from short lead time products such as our handheld instruments to our longer lead time systems for metals, mining and commodity material applications. Our leading ion chromatography business which we gained with the Dionex acquisition performed very well in the quarter, especially in applied markets.", "We also continue to see strong demand for our clinical diagnostic products, specifically our assays for drugs-of-abuse testing and our biomarker tests, which I'll talk a little more about in a few moments.", "Moving to pharma and biotech. Our Biopharma Services business had a very strong quarter. We have the scale and depth of capabilities to offer outsourcing for clinical trials manufacturing, packaging and distribution. This enables our customers to safely and efficiently deliver clinical trial materials to investigators and patients worldwide. ", "And a quick comment on Asia-Pacific. Again, we are pleased to see that our investments to expand our presence there are paying off. We had a great quarter across all of our emerging markets with China, India, Korea and Brazil delivering double-digit growth. These continue to be our fastest-growing regions and we're experiencing healthy growth in multiple market segments there.", "Turning specifically to China for a moment, we're very encouraged by the momentum we're seeing in environmental markets there. You may recall that we moved the headquarters of our environmental business to Shanghai a couple of years ago. We've been collaborating closely with the Shangshi EPA, and recently won a significant order for our analytical instruments for soil and water testing. Our efforts also resulting in early adoption of our Mercury air quality monitors, which we believe will present a terrific opportunity for us as China implements its 5-year plan.", "As you know, we're a company that's committed to investing in technology development and we had an exceptional quarter in terms of new product launches. Our showing at ASMS this year was our strongest yet, with 3 new mass spectrometry systems that redefine performance in resolution, speed, sensitivity and accuracy. Our new Prima PRO, Orbitrap Elite and QEC systems take analysis to new levels for applications ranging from life sciences to environmental protection and food safety.", "I recently met with one of our academic customers who bought an Orbitrap Elite. He was so thrilled by the proteomics analysis made possible by the system that he actually helped us sell another instrument to a CRO that he collaborates with. In our chromatography business, we launched a new nano LC system at ASMS that integrates our entire portfolio of mass spectrometry products. In Specialty Diagnostics, we launched 6 oral fluid immunoassays that have been cleared by the FDA for drugs-of-abuse testing. There are obvious benefits in terms of specimen collection from these new tests.", "On a final note here, I'm pleased to report that 2 of our new Thermo Scientific products made R&D Magazine's list of this year's top 100 innovations. One was our evolution 200 spectrophotometer, which was designed for routine QA/QC analysis in the life science, food and beverage and materials science industries. The second was the Dionex ICS-5000, the market's first capillary ion chromatography system, which is used to identify and measure contaminants in water and other liquids for a range of industries.", "Our second key EPS growth driver, operational excellence, continues to give us the ability to translate top line growth into strong bottom line results. I'd like to make 2 points here today. One is that I'm pleased to say that our PPI and other productivity initiatives across the company are allowing us to once again gain SG&A leverage. And two, I used Dionex as an example of how we apply our proven operating processes to integrate new businesses smoothly and efficiently. We've owned Dionex since mid-May, but the integration planning began on the day we announced our agreement back in December. It's obviously a great business and our objective is to go through a very detailed integration process to ensure that we capture the expected synergies. I am pleased to say that the integration is going extremely well and the business is off to a great start financially, with revenue growth right in line with our expectations. With strong results across the board, the Dionex business has already made a positive contribution to our overall performance.", "Our third key contributor to EPS growth is effective capital deployment and that continues to create shareholder value. First, let me cover acquisitions. We've deployed $2.1 billion on acquisitions completed so far this year. I just mentioned Dionex and let me add that we're very pleased to welcome their 1,600 employees to our team. We also made 2 smaller strategic acquisitions over the last couple of months, Sterilin a leading provider of plastic laboratory consumables in the United Kingdom broadens our customer offering and gives us another opportunity to leverage our global commercial organization. And just after quarter end, we extended our microbiology offering by acquiring TREK Diagnostic Systems. TREK is a provider of products used for blood culture, identifying microorganisms and conducting antibiotics susceptibility testing. Both of these businesses have about $35 million in annual revenues and we look forward to the growth opportunities they present by increasing our depth of capabilities for our customers.", "As you know, in the quarter, we also announced the acquisition of Phadia, a global leader in allergy and autoimmune diagnostic testing. We talked a lot about this at the time of signing and at our Analyst meeting, so I'm not going to go to the details again. But at a high-level, Phadia will significantly enhance our leadership in the high-growth Specialty Diagnostics market, which is a key growth platform for our company. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report that the acquisition process is moving along a little faster than we expected and we now expect to close Phadia late in Q3.", "Clearly, it's been an active year in M&A so far, but I also want to make the point that we're focused on deploying our capital to buy back our stock and we spent $225 million during the quarter to repurchase 3.8 million shares. For the first half of this year, we spent $763 million and have repurchased 13.5 million of our shares. So we continue to create shareholder value both through M&A and share buybacks.", "Switching gears, I'd like now to highlight a key growth theme as I've done over the past few quarters. To remind you the intent is to describe how our investments broaden the growth opportunities for Thermo Fisher by collectively driving our revenue growth, leveraging our unique depth of capabilities across the company and fulfilling our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. This quarter, the theme is about meeting the important needs that healthcare has for both patients, and at the same time, lowering the cost of care. You've heard me talk about our biomarker business and the strong performance it's delivered over the past couple of years. Increasing awareness of biomarkers has been driven by the adoption of our PCT test for sepsis, which is a whole body inflammatory response to an infection that is often life-threatening. Every year, sepsis strikes an estimated 750,000 people in the U.S. alone with a total cost of the healthcare system of approximately $16 billion. Mainly as a result of the aging population, the incidence of severe sepsis in the U.S. is expected to rise to 1 million by the end of the decade. Early diagnosis and treatment would result in fewer lives loss and lower cost of care. ", "In Europe and other parts of the world, you can find our PCT biomarker assays on some of the leading central lab platforms, including bioM\u00e9rieux, Siemens and Roche. BioM\u00e9rieux's Vitus[ph] platform is also cleared by the FDA to run our PCT test in the U.S. We provide other biomarker tests that can differentiate a patient who is having a heart attack from those with less severe medical conditions associated with difficulty in breathing. While it's important to treat the underlying conditions, it may not necessitate costly levels of care associated with a heart attack. ", "We had a significant development in our biomarker business last week when we signed a long-term license agreement with Alere to add a number of our biomarker assays to the menu of their leading Triage platform. Alere Triage systems are found in more than 70% of U.S. hospitals in about 50 countries worldwide. This extensive install base of instruments significantly strengthens our ability to raise awareness of these tests and make them accessible to a much broader population of patients. The agreement extends the availability of these tests to include emergency rooms and physicians labs, opening an entirely new market for our biomarker test for sepsis, cardiovascular and lower respiratory diseases. As Alere works through the regulatory approval process, we anticipate even more opportunities to bring these important diagnostic tools to physicians and patients worldwide.", "Before I wrap up, let me give you an update on our annual guidance for 2011. So far, the year is playing out as we expected, with some added benefit due to foreign exchange, bolt-on acquisitions that we've closed recently and additional tax efficiencies that we've generated. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to a new range of $4.08 to $4.18 for the full year in 2011. This would result in 18% to 21% growth over our 2010 results. We are also raising our revenue guidance for the year and now expect to achieve 2011 revenues in the range of $11.60 billion to $11.70 billion for 10% to 11% revenue growth over 2010. ", "So before I hand the call over to Pete, let me summarize my remarks this morning with a few key points. We remain committed to continuing our track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. Our investments in new products and emerging markets are paying off and contributed to our solid performance in Q2. We executed well in the first half and we're on track to achieve our financial goals for the year. ", "So now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Dionex in mid-May. Given the significant size of this investment, we're providing visibility to the revenue growth performance of the combined companies by calculating organic growth on a pro forma basis as if Dionex were owned for the entire second quarter in both years. We'll follow the same approach with Phadia upon completion of that acquisition.", "We're pleased to report another quarter of strong adjusted earnings per share with 22% year-over-year growth to a second quarter record of $0.99 compared to $0.81 last year. GAAP EPS in Q2 was $1.36, up 139% from $0.57 in the prior year's quarter, including a $0.79 gain on the divestitures of Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories.", "Moving on to our top line performance. Reported revenues increased 12% year-over-year to a second quarter record $2.90 billion. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex were owned for the entire second quarter in both years, total revenues increased by 9% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 4% consistent with the outlook I provided on last quarter's call.", "In terms of Dionex' contribution to organic growth in the quarter, we can't calculate it exactly because we're already seeing some HPLC product substitution, but it's about 0.2% to 0.3%. In addition to organic growth, Q2 pro forma revenues increased by 4% as a result of favorable foreign currency translation and another 1% from acquisitions other than Dionex.", "In the quarter, the net impact of the Biosite headwind lowered our organic growth by about 1%, and I'm happy to say that this is the last quarter that Biosite will be impacting our year-over-year growth comparisons. We continue to strengthen backlog this quarter with bookings finally exceeding revenues. By segment, Analytical Technologies Q2 revenues grew 19% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis as if Dionex were owned for the entire second quarter in both years, Analytical Technologies revenues increased 13% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 6%.", "In the quarter, as Marc highlighted, we continue to see strong growth in clinical diagnostics, specifically our biomarkers business and our instruments businesses is serving industrial and applied markets also continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth. In the Laboratory Products and Services Segment, Q2 revenues increased 6% on a reported basis and grew 2% organically. In the quarter, our Biopharma Services business had strong growth that helped to offset the impact of the Biosite transition.", "By geography in Q2, Asia-Pacific continued high-teens organic growth with strong growth in China, India and Japan. North America, which was impacted unfavorably by Biosite, grew in the low-single digits and Europe declined slightly against a tougher comparison of high single-digit growth in the prior year. Rest of the world grew in the mid-teens driven by Brazil.", "Turning to the bottom line. We had strong adjusted operating income with our Q2 results up 14% year-over-year to $510 million. Adjusted operating margin was 17.6%, up 40 basis points from 17.2% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by pull-through on organic growth and strong cost productivity from our PPI and PPI Lean projects, global sourcing initiatives and ongoing restructuring actions. We also continue to see nice accretion in the quarter from our recent acquisitions.", "These gains were partially offset by strategic investments in R&D and commercial resources to drive future growth. And our pull-through on incremental revenue from foreign currency translation, which typically comes in at around our average adjusted EBITDA margin, was only about half of what we normally see in the quarter. This resulted from substantial foreign exchange movements during the quarter, which impacted our revenue and cost differently than they have historically. We're anticipating -- we aren't anticipating this to be a trend and expect to be closer to our historical average pull-through in future quarters.", "By segment, Q2 adjusted operating income and Analytical Technologies increased 27% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1%, up 120 basis points versus 19.9% last year, driven by pull-through on organic volume growth, the benefits of global sourcing and productivity, moderately higher prices and acquisitions.", "Turning to our Laboratory Products and Services Segment. Q2 adjusted operating income was 13.6%, down 50 basis points from the year-ago quarter. In this segment, solid productivity was offset by unfavorable mix, strategic investments to drive growth and inflationary pressure on raw material costs, particularly in steel and plastic resin. While we expect raw material inflation to remain somewhat of a challenge for the remainder of 2011, we put in place additional sourcing at pricing actions to offset the impact of expected impact.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin was 42.2% in Q2, up 40 basis points from the prior quarter -- from the year-ago quarter, excuse me. This margin expansion was driven by the benefits of our global sourcing and strong cost productivity actions along with acquisitions, partially offset by increased raw material inflation.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 21.7% of revenue, a 10-basis point improvement from the year-ago quarter, as a result of volume leverage and cost-reduction actions. R&D expense was 2.9% of revenue in Q2, up 20 basis points from last year.", "Moving below the line, our Q2 net interest expense increased $11 million year-over-year to $32 million, driven by higher interest expense as a result of issuing $2.2 billion of new debt to fund our acquisition of Dionex, partially offset by savings we realized from refinancing more expensive debt. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 20%, down 70 basis points from last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives, including tax synergies related to Dionex and last year's extension of the R&D tax credit into 2011.", "During the quarter, we deployed $225 million of our cash to buy back 3.8 million shares of our stock, which left $475 million remaining at quarter end under our current $750 million authorization that expires in February 2012. Average diluted shares were 386 million in the quarter, down 30 million or 7% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 and 2011 share buyback programs as well as redemption of our convertible debt.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash flow performance remains solid. Year-to-date, cash flow from continuing operations was $680 million and free cash flow was $560 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $120 million. Year-to-date, free cash flow was up $55 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher operating income and improved working capital performance, partially offset by the timing of cash tax payments.", "We ended the quarter with $1.36 billion in cash and investments, down $1.43 billion from Q1, primarily as a result of closing Dionex, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of Athena Diagnostics and Lancaster Laboratories. Our total debt was $4.0 billion, down $273 million from Q1, primarily as a result of redeeming our 3.25% convertible notes.", "Now moving on to our guidance for 2011. As Marc mentioned, we're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to a new range of $4.08 to $4.18, which represents 18% to 21% growth over our 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.46. This guidance includes our completed acquisition of Dionex but it does not include any impact from the pending acquisition of Phadia.", "In terms of revenue, we're raising our 2011 guidance by $80 million to a new range of $11.60 billion to $11.70 billion. This range represents 10% to 11% growth over our 2010 reported revenues of $10.57 billion.", "Compared to our previous guidance, about $50 million of the revenue increase is related to more favorable foreign currency translation and the remainder comes from the Sterilin and TREK Diagnostic acquisitions that we recently closed. The total impact of favorable foreign currency on our 2011 revenue guidance is a little less than 2.5% growth and the total revenue impact from completed acquisitions, other than Dionex, is a little more than 1% growth. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates.", "In terms of pro forma organic revenue growth, the midpoint of our revenue guidance remains unchanged at about 4% growth. As I mentioned last quarter, excluding the Biosite and Japan stimulus headwinds we experienced in the first half of the year, this would be 5%.", "Our adjusted income tax rate is expected to be around 20%, which is flat with last year and down 0.5% from our previous outlook, primarily as a result of incremental tax synergies related to Dionex. And our full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 387 million to 389 million, up slightly from our previous range as a result of the accounting impact of our higher stock price. This estimate assumes that we use the remaining $475 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration in February 2012. All these adds up to the $0.03 increase in adjusted EPS and the $80 million increase in reported revenues.", "Finally, as Marc mentioned, we're very pleased to report that we now expect to close on Phadia in late Q3. Adding Phadia from late Q3 onward would add about $0.06 of adjusted EPS to our 2011 results, with about $0.01 coming in Q3, depending on when we finance the transaction and the actual close date.", "So in summary, we're pleased to report another solid quarter which keeps us right on track to achieve our 2011 financial goals. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "This earnings season has been a really interesting one. Lots of noise on the academic side. Marc, maybe you could give a little color on what you're seeing -- have things changed? Are they steady? Did you see any change with respect to maybe daily orders or instrument orders for the quarter?", "Marc Casper", "Quintin, thanks for the question. Maybe I can give a kind of a holistic view of what's happening with our 4 end markets to put some context there. From an overall perspective, there really were no significant changes in our 4 end markets from what we saw in Q1. I think that's an important point. Starting with industrial and applied, which is the fastest-growing, demand continues to be very strong across all the geographies. We saw robust growth in the businesses that served the markets, especially Process Instruments businesses in particular. Biopharma, which is always an area of interest, market conditions again were very similar to what we've seen in the past few quarters. For us, Biopharma grew, Quintin, at about the company average. And in particular, I'm very pleased with how our bioprocess production and our Biopharma Services businesses performed in serving those customer base. Healthcare and Diagnostics, as I mentioned in my first remarks, our Clinical Diagnostics business once again had a really good quarter, particularly biomarkers and drugs-of-abuse and therapeutic drug monitoring. And as Pete mentioned, this is the last quarter we need to mention Biosite, that's good news for everybody. And then academic and government, which is what prompted my thoughts here, they're very similar, those markets to what we saw in Q1. So no, particularly significant changes.", "Quintin Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated", "Great. And then a quick follow-up for us is that we hear a lot of questions on what your appetite for future acquisitions are, given the fact that you've got a lot in your plate now, those that are on are doing pretty well. So any update there?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. In terms of the acquisitions, as I mentioned, Dionex integration is going well. Phadia planning is going well. We're excited about those 2. We're very focused on getting those right, so that's where we're putting our attention. And we did a couple nice bolt-ons as well. So really, no surprise to anybody on the call. We're really focused on executing extremely well against the acquisitions we are committed to.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "First question, I just wanted to go into a little more detail on the pricing environment. I think you made some comments there on the prepared statements about the pricing environment. And Pete, can you also just expand on the commodity impacts that you're seeing across the globe?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, in terms of the pricing environment, it's pretty similar to what we've been seeing for the last several quarters so we're getting price between 0.5% and 1% right now, a little bit stronger on consumables than on the instruments and equipment. So that environment really hasn't really changed much. In terms of the commodities, as I said, it's primarily, for us, anyway, plastic resins. We have a few other things that are oil-based and in terms of what we buy as a commodity, that's only about $100 million of our input costs in total. So it's not a huge number but those costs fluctuated quite a bit. And then we're seeing it a little bit in raw steel, again, that cost base is only around $35 million for the company. So we are seeing some dramatic inflation there that we, as I said, have put in some price increases to offset and then we're driving further sourcing actions to offset it in the second half of the year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc", "And just as a follow-up on the first question on end markets specifically, Academic Government, what kind of visibility do you feel like you have? How far out is your visibility on that end market?", "Marc Casper", "When I think about visibility, we obviously serve most every academic institution around the world. So we have tremendous amount of dialogue with our customers in terms of what's going on. So it's more qualitative visibility and what I would say is that in the first 6 months of the year, there hasn't been a big shift in the tone of what's going on amongst those customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "So if we think about the Lab Products division, obviously, margins there have been kind of up and down the last few quarters. If you think about investments you've put in place kind of revenue growth which is obviously been a drag, vis-\u00e0-vis Biosite and flu last year. How are we to think about sort of the trajectory of that business, given the mix we're seeing. And in turn, given some of the changes you've made maybe on the pricing side more recently, which is typical and so I'm just trying to get a sense for kind of how you're thinking about leverage there and how happy you are with kind of how margins have trended?", "Marc Casper", "So Ross, as I look at Lab Products and Services, first of all, thinking on the top line, the comparisons get substantially easier in the second half of the year because Biosite sits in that part of the business. So we'll see better top line performance based on just that fact. From a margin perspective, some of the things that we've been focused on from an investment perspective, we have less exposure to Asia-Pacific currently in those markets and less exposure to industrial in that part of our business. We are seeing the early benefits of the work in Asia-Pacific, so actually the growth is going to improve and then obviously we're spending a lot in the advance of the growth in Asia-Pacific, so that creates a little bit of a margin pressure. But that's going to improve as you get through the year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG", "And just touching back on sort of the geographic breakdown, I mean, from an emerging market perspective, if you sort of look at China, India, Lat Am, obviously you've seen some pretty substantial growth there in the last few years and into this quarter. If you think about sort of ordering trends and the pacing of demand in those various areas, I mean, have we seen it fairly constant? Has it been more choppy? I mean, obviously, on China, there's been a lot of concern. As the government put the brakes on with inflation that we're going to see some soft patches there and obviously GDP has come down a bit. I mean, how should we think about that relative to kind of the steadiness of the order rate your seeing based on the mix?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of China, let's focus there because it's the most significant. We grew about 20% in the quarter, which was exactly how we performed in Q1. Bookings were larger than revenue, so we built backlog. In reviewing with the team a few days ago, very confident in the second half outlook. I know it's a common question that we get but our team is performing well and the markets continue to look strong.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "First, I just want to touch on the Pharma spending environment. Are you guys seeing any major capital purchases being pushed back in a material way, whether it be in the research labs or in the commercial labs?", "Marc Casper", "No. I think the conditions are pretty similar to what we've seen on the capital side with pharma over the last few quarters, which is the customers are buying the products that they need. They're conservative, but they are spending and we continue to see pretty similar conditions.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.", "Great. Okay. And then maybe just secondly, on Phadia, can you just remind us kind of what hurdles are left across, pursuant to that late 3Q close?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, so from a Phadia perspective, integration planning is going really well. The teams are ready for day one, which is terrific, so that's the most important. We did receive FTC clearance in the U.S., so that's behind us. And we actually got our filings, actually faster than we expected, which is why we are moving the expected close day from Q4 into later into Q3, so we moved it up. And the primary jurisdiction that we are just waiting on is the EU.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.[Technical Difficulty] Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "If we go back and look at some of the areas where you run into issues a year ago, the healthcare channel and biopharma services, it seems like there's been improvement in both of those. Is that a function of easy comps or are you feeling like those businesses are back in the growth trajectory?", "Peter Wilver", "So let's start with Biopharma Services. The business is executing extremely well and the value proposition is very meaningful to our pharmaceutical customers. So what we're doing is providing outsourcing capabilities for what many customers used to do in-house. So we're doing the packaging, logistics and some cases the manufacturing of clinical trials materials. You might recall that a company like Lilly had turned over those operations to us. I had the chance to visit with the team out in Indianapolis as well as the customer they are very happy with the performance. So the business is just doing a good job of serving the customer, and that's really good fundamental, operational performance. Healthcare market, that part of our business does benefit from -- it didn't benefit yet from an easier comparison, it benefits going forward from an easier comparison because Biosite sits there. But it seems it's actually executing very well and in fact our relationship with Abbott where we are their channel partner for many of their products is going extraordinarily well and that's good execution. So there -- the benefits coming in the future, meaning Q3.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "Okay. And then, I think in Pete's comments he mentioned some initial revenue captures synergies with Dionex. Can you just talk a little about how are you thinking about top line synergies here in the near term? And are you starting to see additional column attached rates associated with that business?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, right now it's obviously small because we've only owned the business 6 weeks in the quarter. But there actually was some specific instrument wins, where Thermo Fisher Scientific colleagues identified new chromatography opportunities on the ion chromatography side for Dionex and there are some specific environmental wins, where our Dionex colleagues now, of course, Thermo Fisher colleagues, identified ICP, which is a key Environmental Instruments wins -- mass spec wins right off of day one. So people have been thinking about it and converting it into orders. The column attached rates, that's way too soon. That takes applications work and so forth but that will happen over time.", "Tycho Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co", "And then maybe just last one on the applied markets, are you anticipating kind of accelerating growth here? I mean we've seen a number of regulations around, obviously, food testing but there's been some additional environmental ones lately. Can you just talk about your outlook on kind of the applied testing market?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, so both applied and industrial we're seeing very strong growth, we're expecting that to continue. I certainly found it heartening that the President said the other night about the importance of food safety that made his top 10 list, so that's good for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of a focus. So yes, I don't know whether it is for the strengthening or not, but we've had very good markets and we're seeing all the signs that they're going to continue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "This is Dane in for Jon. I was just wondering if you could provide a little additional color with regards to the leverage on the operating margin line. I know you explained Lab Products and Services, but I'm just wondering if there's anything else going on there that we should be thinking about or anything we should be thinking about going forward?", "Peter Wilver", "In terms of our operating margin expansion in the quarter, it's about 40 basis points. So like a number of moving parts but pretty similar with what we've seen in the past. We had nice contribution from productivity, about 2.5 percentage points improvement on productivity. That was offset by inflation, which as I said is a bit higher than normal at 1.5 percentage points. And then we made investments that totaled almost 1 percentage point. So those all sort of net to 0. As I mentioned, FX was a little bit dilutive in the quarter, which is unusual. We don't expect that to continue. That basically offset the acquisition benefit that we've got. So again those 2 net to 0. And then the balance, so the 40 basis points is basically price/volume mix. So that's the story there. The components are similar to the previous quarters but, let's say, the FX was a little bit of an unusual drag on the expansion in the quarter.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "All right. Could you maybe provide a little bit of color on what you saw in consumables, services and instrument trends during the quarter? And how you think those might play out for the rest of the year?", "Peter Wilver", "In terms of the split between equipment, consumables and service, we actually, as Marc said, Biopharma Services was very strong in the quarter. So that was kind of 10-plus percent growth in the quarter, equipment was around 5% and then consumables was basically flat, but that again is impacted by the Biosite transition. Going forward, I would expect more normal growth in consumables and comparable growth in equipment.", "Dane Leone - Macquarie Research", "All right, great. Any idea what that has been ex Biosite?", "Peter Wilver", "I don't have the number off the top of my head.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.", "Dan Arias - UBS", "Just on manufacturing, you've stated pretty consistently that the move towards low-cost regions is something that you look to improve margins. How much do global macro concerns play a role in the decision-making and timing for those operational changes?", "Marc Casper", "So when you look at our global manufacturing footprint, we serve from a low-cost region perspective really in 4 geographies, which is Mexico, Eastern Europe, Singapore and China. So we haven't put all of our manufacturing in one site. So our drive towards more low-cost manufacturing is going to continue and then we select the country based on what we think is the optimal economic risk and so forth, and we have a pretty detailed way if thinking through that. If one country becomes more favorable or not, or -- doesn't change the strategy, just means we shift the focus where we put the lower cost of production.", "Dan Arias - UBS", "Okay. And just looking at your 5% target for organic growth next year. Has anything changed over a short, but I'd say, eventful 2 months in terms of where you see the most opportunity or the biggest challenges to get to that level?", "Marc Casper", "So obviously in February we'll certainly give our 2012 guidance. But as I said, in answering Quintin's question in the beginning, the market conditions have been very similar to what we saw in the first quarter. So it would have also been very similar to what we saw in May. So nothing really has changed.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Pete, on your guidance for organic growth for the year of 4%, does that include the -- how you're showing pro forma Dionex internal growth now in the AP business, I'm just trying to figure out what impact that's having in -- what true internal growth was this quarter?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, the 4% includes -- it's on a pro forma basis including Dionex, it's the same answer whether you include Dionex or not. As I said, we can't calculate it exactly but it's only about 0.2% for the full year in terms of the impact.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay, and then Marc, I'm just wondering if you could expand upon your comments regarding new product launches, especially the products at ASMS? How those are going, the availability of those products so far, your ability to meet demand?", "Marc Casper", "So we had a wonderful American Society of Mass Spectrometry, which was in early June, and when you look at the feedback, the feedback from the customers has been fantastic, and one of the things that is a really good indicator of that is from a new product launch, we have the largest number of demo requests. Basically, customer give some samples to run, then we can remember for any products that we've launched. It's incredible the demand we have for demonstrations, especially if the queue is active. That bodes well for a meaningful contribution of new products in the second half of the year. So obviously, because of a June launch, the impact in Q2 was immaterial but the leading indicators are very encouraging for the impact, which is good because when we set up our guidance for the year, we said that new products will be a nice driver in the second half and when your customers are telling you that the new products look really good that puts us in position to have confidence in our outlook.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Do those products, the new launches, probably hit in the third quarter or in the fourth quarter?", "Marc Casper", "They're all ready to ship. We shipped a few of all of those instruments in Q2 so that will affect both quarters. Obviously a little more in Q4 because customers that are asking for demos want to see the result and get funding, but Q3 we'll have a nice impact as well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with CLSA.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "I've been looking at the off margins. I believe I see a 13.6% versus 14.1% Lab Products margin. Is that from the higher commodity costs?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, certainly. As I said in my comments, lab products and services was impacted by the commodity prices, most. That's the segment where we have input costs from plastic, as well as steel. So that impact comes in that segment and we also had impact from mix as well in that segment.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then Marc, can you talk about what you saw in the tone of capital equipment like mass spec versus the tone you saw in Lab Products like products from the old Fisher catalog?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, from a tone perspective actually, not a big difference from the types of products. I think customers are just thinking about funding environments in general, and that's where we saw nice consistency across both quarters, which is effectively our instruments business continues to grow a little faster than the consumables business simply because it's benefiting from an economic recovery and you have more stability in consumables, if you will, but not a big difference in tone between the product types.", "Paul Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc.", "And then lastly, how long do you think it takes to have a truly integrated LC/MS system?", "Marc Casper", "When you think about optimizing all the software and all of the different permutations, you'll start to see the benefit of that in the next couple of quarters and some of those will take longer than that. But some of that is already happening today. But to get everything optimize, it takes a couple of quarters work.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital", "Marc, was there noticeable disruption in the quarter because of the continuing resolution related uncertainty? Just looking forward could we think about orders getting pushed sort of later and later into the NIH fiscal because of the wrangling that we are seeing over the budget?", "Marc Casper", "No. When you think about Academic and Government, very similar to what we saw in Q1. I think when I think about it, basically what we said at the end of the quarter last time was we thought that the continuing resolution once that was behind us. We'd see a slight improvement in the end markets -- in the academic markets for the balance of the year and what we're seeing in Q2 is pretty much exactly as we saw in Q1. So you didn't see a pickup, but I don't think you're seeing like a deferral or a big bolas of activity that's going to happen later. We're expecting very much consistent markets in Academic and Government for the balance of the year. That means flattish to down a few points in terms of the U.S. environment.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital", "Okay, that's helpful. And then how did the order book look at the end of the quarter in terms of later cycle and markets, especially in the more developed geographies, did that start to improve or as that trend through the quarter, how did the order book trend?", "Marc Casper", "The orders for our longer lead times instrumentation was very strong. The quarter was similar to the previous quarter, which is signs of a strong industrial economy with customers that are making long-term decisions for capital expansions, capital refurbishments, meaning projects that are from their perspective is going to happen 12 or 18 months from now, they're making those decisions so we're seeing really, really nice orders across those types of markets.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital", "Thanks, Marc. And Pete just a quick one on capital deployment. It's obviously a consistent theme and I was wondering how you think about dividend versus more tactical buybacks?", "Peter Wilver", "At this point, that's not something we're contemplating in the near term.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "What drove the strength within the Diagnostics? Did you see any of the weakness from patient visits, deferrals, et cetera?", "Marc Casper", "When we look at our business, typically the big drivers are cancer incidence and infectious disease are the 2 big drivers of which that's going to be a little bit more immune from what you might read in the popular press. So we didn't see a big impact from patient visits one way or the other. I mean that's historically been our comments in the space and that's -- that continues to be true and particularly, our Clinical Diagnostics business performed extraordinary well in terms of our performance and that's been a lot of quarters in a row. So we're very pleased with how our team is executing and the quality of our products.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Peter, I might have missed this but my call dropped, but what was the contribution of Dionex in the quarter and that 4% organic was that -- if you include it or even if you excluded Dionex completely?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, it's about -- as I said, we can't really calculate it exactly because we do have some product substitution on HPLC, but it's about 0.2% to 0.3% in the quarter.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And then expectations of hybrid systems coming out from Dionex and Thermo, when do you expect those coming through, Marc?", "Marc Casper", "Customers can get them today but when they'll be fully optimized, next couple of quarters, you'll see that all come out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Pete, so the obligatory cash flow question, any changes at the margin of on the operating or CapEx outlook for '11?", "Peter Wilver", "No, it's basically the same, $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion of free cash flow and around $300 million of CapEx.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay. And then on the Phadia deal, any changes to the financing assumptions? It looks like you put a big commercial paper program in. So would you comment on your kind of updated expectations for the blended interest costs for that deal?", "Peter Wilver", "Yes, at this point, and what I included in the numbers in the expectations for post close in 2011, we haven't really changed the assumption for financing. We do have a commercial paper as the components of the financing but of course until we actually close the financing we don't really no what the actual interest rate is going to be, so we're kind of sticking with the original assumption which is around 3%. We do plan to access the capital markets a couple of weeks ahead of time prior to the close, which obviously is a little bit dilutive to Q3, but nothing has really change from our original assumptions.", "Jon Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc.", "Okay, got it. And the last one, can you parse out the actual Dionex revenue like the absolute dollar number in the quarter?", "Peter Wilver", "We do, of course, know what Dionex revenue was in the quarter but as I said, we do have product substitution between the 2 businesses. The total contribution of Dionex was a little more than 2% growth.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Maybe just a very quick follow-up to the Dionex math because I think folks are obviously focused on this and not completely clear. If it weren't for Dionex, if you excluded it out both periods, would organic growth have been north of 4% for you?", "Peter Wilver", "Not north of 4%, no -- basically the same number yes.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay, and then it sounds like an obvious question, but I think it's an important one given how jittery the markets are right now so I am going to ask it. If over the course of July there were any material slowdowns in any geography or end market, you would have seen this at this point and obviously contemplated that in guidance, correct?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, of course, we would of. We don't stop at June 30 and then say, we're not going to do any thinking between now and then, Doug. So we're taking the reflections of what's going on in the world, what our performance was in the first few weeks of July into our guidance. And I want to make it clear because for our investors, our organic outlook and our performance outlook for the year is exactly as we articulated from the previous quarter and the fact that we're putting Dionex in it is to provide clarity into the numbers exactly how we did the methodology for when we put Thermo and Fisher together some years ago. So this doesn't change our outlook. So we benefited from raising our guidance from the 3 factors, a little bit more favorable foreign exchange, we closed 2 bolt-on acquisitions, which we reflected in the numbers and our tax team have done some really good work and actually generated some nice upsides that weren't fully contemplated from the Dionex acquisitions. So hopefully that provides some clarity around what we are trying to do.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC", "Okay. Thanks for your patience on that one. And then just one last modeling question. I believe last quarter, you talked about gross margin improvement of about a point year-over-year, offset by some increase in operating expenses I think about 35 basis points as a percentage of sales year-over-year. More or less, does that guidance remain intact for the year?", "Peter Wilver", "I think actually -- Yes, it's about the same as those numbers. Yes.", "Operator", "And at this time, we have no further questions. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Marc Casper for any closing remarks.", "Marc Casper", "So let me just make a quick comment to close up the call. First, thank you, of course. We're pleased to report solid financial performance in this past quarter and really starting to see the benefits of our past investments paying off in terms of the new product launches and the growth we're seeing in emerging markets. We're right on track to meet our growth goals for the year and we look forward to reporting our progress in Q3. As always, thank you for the support of Thermo Fisher.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] I must advise you that this conference is being recorded, today, Tuesday, October 25, 2011. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ms. Agnes Lee, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Agnes Lee", "Thank you, Vivian, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me on the call today are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. In addition, Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you haven't received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website, at lifetechnologies.com. I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Thanks, Agnes, and thank you, all, for joining our call today. I hope you've had a chance to review the press release that we issued earlier this afternoon. As you will have seen, our year-on-your non-GAAP revenue increased 7% including currency and 4% without currency. This translated to almost 30% operating margins and $0.94 of non-GAAP earnings per share. We're pleased with these results, especially given the tough macro environment we're all facing. Our broad range of consumable products continue to be sought out after customers who want to ensure the highest quality tools for their everyday research needs. ", "Because of the breadth of our product lines, we're exposed to all types of labs and customers that provides us with a useful perspective. Let me take a moment to share some color on what we're seeing in various end markets.", "There's been a lot of discussion recently about government funding on research. In our view, it's clear that funding in developed markets is going to be less than it was historically. That said, we believe this environment has settled for the next few months, specifically in the U.S. and Europe. But there remains multiple end markets that are stable, even demonstrating very attractive growth. A few of those markets are government-funded research in emerging markets and applied markets such as food and animal safety and molecular diagnostics. ", "In addition, the biotech segment for us is still growing quite nicely as demand for our Bioproduction offerings increases. ", "As it relates to regional growth, we see the same macroeconomic trends we saw in the second quarter prevailing again in this quarter, leading to growth by region of 2% in the Americas, 5% in Europe, 14% in Asia-Pacific and a decline of 2% in Japan.", "This year, we have placed a greater intensity on increasing our competitiveness in core markets. Our goal is to remain the vendor of choice by providing a complete range of product offerings that fit every level of budget and research need. Further, we continuously look for ways of adding value by providing more convenient and efficient ways to purchase from us. One such new example is our new lifetechnologies.com website, which went live several weeks ago. This new site was designed around the users that visit our website every day to find the latest scientific protocols and purchase their lab essentials. This website has been live in beta form for over 2 months, and we received extremely positive feedback from the user community. We're happy to present this new site to our customers and expect it will make their purchasing experience with us even easier and more favorable than ever.", "Other bright spots within the quarter include our applied businesses such as molecular diagnostics and forensics, as well as several new product introductions. As I said earlier, the applied markets continue to present good growth opportunities for us as demonstrated through a large forensic order delivered to the Russian government this quarter. We have also just received China SFDA clearance for our 3500 diagnostics CE instrument. In addition, we have announced several molecular diagnostic collaborations recently that are worthy of note, specifically an agreement with GlaxoSmithKline to develop a QPCR-based companion diagnostic for an innovative cancer therapy. You should expect more of these types of companion diagnostic arrangements from us in the future. ", "Beyond expanding our presence into new areas, our innovation engine continues to deliver new products every quarter. In the past few months, we added to our consumables franchise with new reagent kits for both the research and applied markets such as our new VetMAX animal health diagnostic kit and our MagMAX kit, which is used to isolate RNA and DNA from cancer tumor tissues. In addition, we have made incredible progress with the Ion Torrent technologies and remain ahead of our technical roadmap and milestones. We released 8 important new products for this system. We also started to develop our access for the 318 chip, which is expected to launch by December. With this chip, we will achieve a 100-fold increase in throughput in less than one year. The Ion Torrent technology helps us deliver on our vision of democratizing sequencing, enabling researchers in any-size lab to access and utilize our products. We believe the market is expanding beyond large core lab, and this is what we hope to enable through our product offerings.", "In addition, the trends toward decentralization and greater demand for desktop sequencing increases the need for confirmatory testing and downstream analysis. The Applied Biosystems Sanger sequencing and QPCR technologies are the gold standards for this confirmatory testing, and we expect it to continue to be an important part of the workflow as genetic research that starts in next-generation sequencing moves towards applications in other commercial markets.", "In summary, we are executing well and focused on optimizing our core business. Despite the slowdown in government research funding this year, we don't expect it to get materially worse in the near future. We are benefited by the fact that we have such a diverse portfolio that we aren't tied to the fate of any one technology or end market. Nonetheless, we are repositioning the company for a slower growth environment. We are doing this by lowering our cost structure, focusing our R&D efforts and optimizing a way in which we market and sell our products. Above all else, we remain committed to continuing to provide our customers with outstanding products and services.", "Before I turn the call over to David, I'd like to mention the recent management change. As of today, Bernd Brust will be taking a consultative role to work on several special projects for the company. I'd like to thank Bernd for his years of service with Life Technologies and for his help this last year as we formulized the approach into the molecular medicine market. ", "With that, I will hand it over to David to walk you through the details of the quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. Taking a closer look at divisional results for the quarter, the Cell Systems division non-GAAP revenue was $244 million, an increase of 10% over the same period last year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue grew 6% year-over-year. This performance was the result of solid growth in all regions and most product lines, including low double-digit growth in our Bioproduction business.", "The Molecular Biology Systems division non-GAAP revenue was $426 million, an increase of 3% versus prior year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue for the division was flat due to the general funding environment. One exception is our QPCR franchise, which grew, driven by new products launched in the last year and increased consumables sales.", "The Genetic Systems division non-GAAP revenue was $256 million in the quarter, an increase of 12% over the same period last year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue increased 8%. One of the items that positively impacted growth in the quarter was the Russian forensic order that Greg mentioned earlier. In addition, growth in this division was driven by strong sales of the Ion Torrent PGM and associated products, partially offset by reduced sales of 5500 products.", "Ion Torrent sales were approximately $20 million for the quarter, an increase of 50% sequentially. We also shipped over 400 OneTouch sample prep systems. As Greg mentioned, we are currently ahead of our technical milestones for Ion Torrent, and we expect to continue to see a tenfold improvement in throughput every 6 months with this platform.", "In aggregate, revenue increased 7%, or 4% excluding currency. Third quarter non-GAAP gross margin was 66.1%, 70 basis points lower than prior year. Higher price realization and productivity were offset by negative mix from higher instrument sales, lower royalty revenue and currency. ", "On a sequential basis, however, gross margin increased by approximately 190 basis points primarily due to lower manufacturing overhead costs, currency and a positive benefit from product mix mainly due to fewer 5500 upgrades and increased sales of core consumables. Third quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $340 million, an increase of 4% over prior-year levels. As a percent of revenue, operating expenses decreased over 110 basis points year-on-year.", "Sequentially, operating expenses decreased by $3.5 million due to restructuring initiatives and controls on discretionary spending, partially offset by an increase in employee benefits. ", "Non-GAAP operating income was $273 million, an increase of 8% over prior year. Third quarter operating margin was 29.4%, representing an increase of 40 basis points year-over-year. The increase in operating margin over the prior year was a result of our continued focus on realizing operational efficiencies throughout the company.", "In terms of non-GAAP other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $3 million from currency and other items and interest expense of $31 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 27.1%. As you may recall, our tax rate in the third quarter of 2010 was lower than normal due to significant onetime benefits from the reorganization and integration of acquired entities.", "Our sequential tax rate decreased by 80 basis points primarily due to domestic manufacturing incentives and onetime adjustments related to settlements of prior-period tax audits. ", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 186.8 million shares, a decrease of 3.3 million shares over prior year. Dilution from our employee equity plan was more than offset by our ongoing share repurchase program. In the last 90 days, we've repurchased approximately 2.6 million shares for $100 million, 1.9 million of which occurred in the third quarter. This repurchase will offset nearly all of the dilution from the Ion Torrent milestone payment scheduled for early 2012. The 3 million shares associated with that payment were added to our weighted shares in the third quarter, when the technical milestones were achieved.", "GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.52, which includes $0.32 per share of acquisition-related amortization expense, $0.02 per share of noncash interest expense and $0.08 per share of business integration and other charges. On a non-GAAP basis, which excludes these items, diluted earnings per share was $0.94.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, our ending cash and short-term investments were $636 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $565 million. Cash from operating activities was $174 million. Capital expenditures were $32 million. Free cash flow was $142 million. Return on invested capital was 8.6%, and we remain on track to achieve our goal of 10% return on invested capital by 2012. Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.7 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $450 million and senior notes of $2.3 billion. ", "Moving on to our expectations for the full year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance at this time. We expect full year revenue growth of 2% to 4%, excluding the impact of currency, and full year non-GAAP EPS of $3.70 to $3.80. We expect to exit the year at the lower end of this range.", "A few more specifics are as follows: At September month-end exchange rates, currency is expected to have little or no impact on our financials in the fourth quarter. Full year interest expense, net of interest income, is expected to be $128 million. Other income and expense, which includes foreign exchange gains and losses, is expected to total $10 million in expense. The full year tax rate is expected to be approximately 27.5%. Average diluted share count for the year is expected to be in the range of 185 million to 187 million shares. Full year free cash flow is still forecast to be in the range of $625 million to $650 million for 2011, including $100 million of onetime restructuring costs.", "And one final note on future expectations, we are currently in our budgeting process for 2012, and we'll be issuing our 2012 guidance early next year as we typically do. ", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Agnes.", "Agnes Lee", "Thanks, David. We will now turn to Q&A. [Operator Instructions] Operator, we are now ready for the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Quintin Lai with Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So Greg, I appreciate -- thanks for giving the kind of extra color on the end markets. Looking for just some more thoughts here, as you're talking about academic markets looking stable from here, have you seen a change in their behavior? Are the customers buying smaller lots, bigger lots, consumables, instruments? I'm just kind of curious on what you're seeing now.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Quintin, as we said at the end of our second quarter earnings call, we probably were the first to see the slowdown in academic, just given the large footprint we have in that space and around the world. And I think you're now starting to see the same words coming from our peers in the industry. So we had about a 90-day head start on taking actions internally to this external environment, and we feel we're in a pretty good spot now. In terms of their buying behavior, I think it stabilized, as we said in our script, from when we first indicated this at the end of the second quarter. It's not gotten worse. It's not gotten better. It's a new level of frugality and conservation in terms of the money that they have. And so that's kind of what we're conveying back to our investors today.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then kind of as a follow-up to that, the restructuring that you're doing now, are you looking at living in this environment, and to that extent, how does that restructuring impact, let's say, like, R&D for new products?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So as we had said back at the second quarter earnings call, we would undertake a restructuring starting at that point. We have executed on that, and sequentially, our operating costs have gone down about $3.5 million, but on a full year basis, much larger than that. So that disruption is behind us now, and we're moving forward. The savings are really coming from being more efficient administratively, fine-tuning the R&D programs and then also in terms of manufacturing efficiencies. So in terms of R&D, to your question, look, I think we will still spend somewhere between 8% and 10%, which is a good, robust investment in innovation. And we feel that that money is deployed in a very high-return way, and so I think we're actually comfortable with where we're now positioning R&D going into 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just 2 questions, one a macro one and then more of a micro one. Greg, I guess by almost any metric you want to look at, obviously, the stock price of Life is reflecting a value that is probably not as good as it should be relative to what's going on in the business. I mean, you have peers of yours who aren't even growing revenues that traded 2x or more your valuation. So I guess how are you thinking about where the stock is and what it is that you need to do in order to get that value reflected more fairly?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You know, Jon, each and every day, we wake up and we manage the company. We don't manage the stock. We feel great about where we are positioned right now. We feel that we have a really good handle on the macroeconomic environment. And I think you can see that now reflected in our operating in margins. They're some of the highest in the industry, and as I've indicated, it could go a little higher from here. So it's a very efficient machine. It's a machine that can see the end markets clearer, probably, in some cases, sooner than others. And we actually feel that we're highly competitive now entering into 2012.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "If I could just -- and maybe as a follow-up, if we're in an environment where a couple of years, as you alluded to, funding is just tough, would you be more inclined to -- and your stock just doesn't reflect very good valuation because of that funding environment, would you be more inclined just to wait through that, or would you be more inclined to try and take a more proactive step to do something?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I'm not sure what do something means. If do something means create shareholder value, then we're all for that. And that has to take a number of measures from driving return on invested capital higher to driving our organic growth higher, if we can, in this environment and just being smarter than everybody else. And that's what we'll be measured on.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I guess, I meant more like being more aggressive on a significant buyback or looking to do something a little bit more extreme in that sense. That was the basis of the question.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. And look, we have continued to return capital to shareholders, $100 million again this quarter. And we're prudent, I think, in our deployment of capital, and I think you'll see us continue to be consistent with what we've been doing over the last couple of years.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, that's fair. And then a quick follow-up, if I could. On Ion Torrent, you're obviously getting a pretty big installed base, it looks like, at this point. Just curious if you can now start to give any kind of insight from an annual consumables standpoint, utilization standpoint, if you're seeing any trends that are worth sharing at this point.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, good question. Let me have Mark weigh in on the consumables consumption of the Ion Torrent and what we're seeing there.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, Jon. So as we've scaled the technology and really delivered on the Ion roadmap here, particularly with the introduction of the 316, we're now seeing good uptake on the reagent usage, and also, now we should see OneTouch. So we're getting about $50,000 per instrument, and we expect that to go higher as we go into Q4, start shipping the 318 chips yet and get close to 60K, 70K rate that we expected as we entered with this technology.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Wanted to start off with a question on China. That was somewhat of a problematic area for you in the second quarter, and obviously, you've made some nice progress there. Can you just walk through, Greg, if you worked through all the headwinds that you commented on last quarter on the dealer networks? And then as we think about the opportunity for the 3500 in China, how are you thinking about that ultimately rolling out?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Sure, Tycho. As we said again at the second quarter earnings call, we saw China returning to its historical growth rates in the third quarter and beyond, that we had accelerated some changes at that time, and we knew they were the right changes, but we moved pretty fast. So we're very pleased to show here in the third quarter that, in fact, China did come back to near its historical growth rate at 16%. And we really believe that the changes we've made here can be built on going forward. Now having said all that, there's more work to go. We believe that China can grow faster than that, and so our goal is to, obviously, deliver on that over the next couple of quarters. In terms of the CE instrument being approved, I think that's very, very important milestone. That's an important product that a lot of content will be developed around in China. And we're putting in place some important partnerships that we'll be announcing that will make that, I think, a real stalwart and an important part of virtually every diagnostic lab in that country. So stay tuned for more announcements.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then as we think about the genetic analysis business overall, you obviously had some nice traction with the forensics business this quarter. Can you talk about how sustainable those trends are and then any color on just the underlying CE trends? You obviously talked about the 5500 being a little bit soft, so if you could just talk about that.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Sure. So the forensics business for us is one of our great franchises. In this quarter, we had the Russian tender, but through the course of the year, we always have a number of tenders like the Russian one, whether it's in South Africa or Brazil. These countries are standardizing on our instrumentation and our consumables and entering that data into their databases. It is a very sticky business. It's also a lumpy business. But it's one where we continue to establish our self as the real standard in crime-fighting using DNA around the world. So good business and lots of technology innovation to come in that area. As you suggest, it's also an important area of growth for our CE instrumentation. As we've said, CE is certainly a mature product, but it's one with some very interesting growth attributes left. We see in research, it's becoming an important tool for confirmatory testing off of next-generation sequencing. And whether it's in forensics or, increasingly now, molecular diagnostics, in validated settings, it's a product that's just at the very beginning, actually, of its life cycle. So because of its high accuracy and because it has found its way into these very important applied businesses, it's a business that, I think, people, perhaps in the investment community, wrote off too soon a long time ago, and I think we've been able to demonstrate it's a business that has real staying power.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then just last one on -- I\u2019m sticking with technology. It seemed like coming out of last quarter, there was some view that QPCR was going to be somewhat difficult in the near term, more on the instruments side, and needed to fill out more focus on assays. Obviously, you've introduced the QuantStudio at ASHG. Do you have a renewed sense of enthusiasm on the outlook for PCR for realtime?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I'm just going to say a few words and hand it to Mark. Mark has personally been engaged in really, I think, revitalizing that business over the last 100 days in terms of how we want to reposition it, coming into this QuantStudio, which is a very important product launch. And Mark, maybe you can talk about the QuantStudio and assays and how we see QPCR going forward.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "So I mean, the QuantStudio builds on acquisition a couple of years ago now of the open array and really integrates to allow people to do a high range of complexity of experiments all the way from research into this validation. It also now gives us a nice portfolio at the top end there in the mid-range with our Viia 7, the entry level with our step 1 [ph] and step 1 plus [ph]. So we're well positioned to cross the range of the end systems. And also, our investment on assays, new assay format has allowed us to continue to grow that business and really use our sales channel and power and now our new website to ensure we get the attachment necessary after we sell those initial instruments. So it's working out very well, that strategy.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Greg, I appreciate that you're still in your 2012 budgeting process, but if I recall last quarter, you did talk about mid-single-digit revenue and double-digit EPS growth for 2012. So I'm wondering, does that still hold, or should we table those expectations as well?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "At this point, we're in the process of putting the plan together, and I think it's premature to comment on what it's going to be in 2012.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, so that's a yes. I'll take it. Can you then also go into the Cell Systems business? Obviously, Bioproduction was a highlight, but could you comment also on some of the other product categories within that group?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Mark?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, within that product group, we have a diverse set of brands and portfolios. Really, it's all a good run rate consumable business, some of our brands like Molecular Probes have continued to be well adopted there. This is really what we had delivered to our channel and that new website. So it's really a nice diverse portfolio, and I think a lot of what we'll find just scientifically, some of the researchers as they discover genetically what's going on, they want to validate those, and they're using some of the cellular techniques to understand that. So again, the breadth of our portfolio plays well in the research lab as we work downstream just to the genetic analysis.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just a quick one on pricing. I know that was something that was a positive for you. Any way you can quantify the pricing impact in the quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, we\u2019ve continued to get realized price in the 1% to 2% range as we have in previous quarters.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Bill Bonello with RBC Capital Markets.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a point of clarification. Did you say that you now expect the 2011's EPS to be at the low end of the range of guidance, or did I hear that wrong?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "No, we said that we expected that both revenue and EPS that we\u2019d be at the low end of the range.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "At the low end? Okay.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And so -- I guess I'm just trying to -- just to understand that a bit, I get that you'll lose $0.06 of currency benefit that you had been expecting in Q4, but on the flip side, Q3 was about a $0.05 higher than the high end of your guidance range. So, what else in Q4 might be looking a bit weaker than you'd previously expected?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Nothing. It's those things.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "So had you always kind of expected to be at the low end of the range?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "No, we're expecting -- we gave the range, we expect to be within that range.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jon Wood with Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just a question on mix. So, I think you guys gave some of the puts and takes the last quarter, but just to make sure, the mix was a negative year-over-year in the third quarter? What do you expect for the mix for the gross margin side in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "We expect -- typically in the fourth quarter, our margin is down somewhat. And we would expect that it would also be impacted this year by our increase in consumables sales. So as the PGM continues to -- on its current pace, that will have a negative impact on the margin.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, so definitely negative year-over-year in the fourth. And then the last one on capital re-allocation, so you bought back some stock, I guess, to offset the Ion Torrent dilution. So is it a reasonable assumption that it's unlikely will see anymore on the buyback side until the bond payment, kind of, the cash portion of Ion Torrent how happens in 1Q '12?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Could you state your -- that final question again?", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes. I was just saying, is it likely we will see buyback ahead of, I know you got a bond payment in the first quarter, assuming you take it out, and then you've got an Ion Torrent -- the cash portion of the Ion Torrent in the first quarter of '12. So I'm just asking, will you deploy capital in front of those 2 events? Or is it -- or should we wait until after, to see incremental buyback?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I think we have to wait and see how things unfold. I mean, we purchased 100 million in the quarter, but that will essentially offset the milestones -- the amount of stock that would be a milestone payment. So, we'll see how the year unfolds and make a decision then.", "Amanda Clardy", "And Jon this is Amanda. Just to clarify one thing from your previous question when David answered the question on gross margin, we were referring sequential, and then you summarized that \"Okay, that's definitely going to be down year-on-year\", that's not what we were talking about, we're talking sequentially.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Oh, it's sequentially -- Amanda, so sequentially, there is incremental headwind in the fourth quarter?", "Amanda Clardy", "Yes, as Ion Torrent ramps up, as well as some of our other instrumentation. But we did not specifically say it was going to be down year-on-year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "So, I want to talk about the molecular biology systems. So when I start looking back over the last few quarters, yes, you go back to the start of Q1, 2010 where you had 10% organic revenue growth then it went to [indiscernible], then it was flat, then negative 1% in Q4 2010, then it's been negative 3%, negative 2% and then flat. So if you're telling me you're getting 1% to 2% price realization from most this year, that essentially means that for this year, you've had essentially no volume growth in the molecular biology business. Now, when I go back and I think about the old Invitrogen business even during tough academic funding situations, there was always some sort of volume growth in the business and the MBS business is a majority of those products. What's going on with the business, and when do we expect to see -- when can we expect to see growth again? Or does this business basically kind of tread water?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I think you're actually starting to see a rebound in the business, first of all, per the quarterly growth statistics you quoted Derik, so that's the first point. I think the second point is, that the 1% to 2% price is an aggregate across the portfolio, and so it happens higher than that in other parts of the portfolio than perhaps in the area we're focusing on right now. And then lastly, I would simply say that the primary area we're now focused on to bring that overall growth rate of Molecular Biology higher is in the overall QPCR franchise. And that was a bit of the question that Mark answered before. So, I think that's where we're focused. That's the work we're doing, and we hope to have that business I think coming back to reasonable organic growth rate in the next couple of quarters here.", "Derik De Bruin - UBS", "Well, I'm also wondering, has there been a change in the -- I hate to keep harping on this, but has there been a change in the competitive environment, have things got tougher in that market? I'm just, as I said, it just -- the trends are just kind of disturbing to me?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I don't think there's been anything dramatically changing there. I think it just requires more focus on our part. I think these are things that we believe we can control better and execute better upon. And so it goes back to some of these earlier questions of, can we do things that overall drive our competitiveness and results, and the answer is yes. And I think you're now picking at an area where we have an opportunity for improvement.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Let me start with a question that I think is a little bit related to Derik's questions. In the past, even going back to the old Invitrogen stand-alone days, when there were macroeconomic headwinds or there were concerns about the funding environment, volumes for consumables tended to hold up a little bit better than instruments, largely just because of the price point, and as we all know, in a period of concern, you can pull back on spending on capital, but to some extent you still got to spend on the consumables if you're going to keep your projects moving. The way you report today, I think it's hard to see if that's happening or not. Could you maybe just speak to anything you may be seeing in terms of whether or not that same resilience is there on the consumable side and keeping these dynamics in mind, how instruments are holding up as well?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Sure. Why don\u2019t Mark and I take a crack at this. But first, overall, the portfolio continues to be -- obviously very heavily weighted towards consumables, and the trends that you described in terms of consumables being more essential in terms of the need to reorder is certainly still in place. And that's why we think Life Technologies is a very resilient company through tougher economic times. I think the other point that I just really should come back to, on Derik's question since you bridged to it, is the fact that inside that Molecular Biology portfolio is a very large patent of state where we get royalties. And we've been very transparent and that -- some of those royalties are going down over the course of time. Now, that creates headwind this year. We're offsetting it to some extent. But that's still a headwind that we've had to work through and it's -- one of the largest drops we've had to deal with is in 2011. So that's also just a little bit of what's going on that I think should color your discussion, and when you look at those results from Molecular Biology. Mark, do you want to add anything else about consumables versus instruments.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes. I would just add that the general thesis that you point too is still very much one that we're executing again, that the everyday needs whether there on these consumables and we have very strong brands behind these, using the Invitrogen brand, you go to our new website, you'll see all the 8 key brands listed across our website, it's very much what we're doing, and then at a more granular level, we know as people are challenged in their budgets making sure we have consumables at the right price points and the right package sizes, invest in our distribution so we get in there quickly to our customers so that's focus on that core business, it's very stable for us, carries on in that consumer ware and then you got these other headwinds against that. So, that's what you're seeing within that portfolio, and I think we'll, over time, overcome these slight quarter-to-quarter variances you may see.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And David if I could just ask you a couple cleaning up questions. If FA -- if we just look at foreign exchange rates where they are today and I apologize if I missed this, what would be the benefit on the bottom line for next year? And what's the right way to think about the annual benefit associated with the recent restructuring?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Okay, on the exchange rates, what we said before, I mean, that the biggest impact would be on our hedges, that were a headwind for us this year. At the current exchange rate, they would add about $0.25.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, so that hasn't changed a lot?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "No, that's the same as previously. I did say in my script that in terms of next quarter, we expect that current exchange rates -- that currency will have little or no impact on results.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And then in terms of the restructuring for next year, I think it was $3.5 million benefit in Q3, but what's the right way to think about that on an annualized basis as we're looking towards 2012?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, it was really in the quarter, it's $3.5 million in operating expenses, then we got about another $1.5 million that's in cost of goods, manufacturing overhead takeout. So about $5 million for the quarter. And what we're saying is, for the second half of the year, we expect it to have an impact of $10 million to $20 million. Yes, you can extrapolate from that to next year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias with UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "David, just a question on one of the out-year financial goals that you've targeted previously. Given the puts and the takes on the P&L and the balance sheet right now, do you still feel like a 10% ROIC by next year is a likely scenario?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay, thank you. And then Mark, I guess one on Ion Torrent. Can you comment on the preferences for PGM consumables? Are you finding that customers are more gravitating towards the 318 chip right now for throughput? Or are they more interested in say the 14 or -- 314 for cost effectiveness as they do their initial runs here?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, we're seeing really different applications in different price points. So the 314 which we've now priced at $99, it allows people to do small amplicons and small bacterial genomes, very efficiently, very cost effectively. And really the volume at the moment is still in the 316 chip, which is what's been available in this third quarter, we're just in early access with the 318 and as people start to look at that, with getting to one gigabyte or more, then you'll start to see different applications. So we expect it to continue to be different price points, different applications right on the PGM as people choose different applications for it.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. I know it is probably a little bit early, but any comments on the reception by customers to the solid improvements in the Wildfire technology?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, we expect that the customers\u2019 existing users as they get their 5500 up and running, will be very pleased with some of the improvements we've been making overall actually, on the 5500. And so we had good reception from some of the users as we get this improvements out and plan to roll them out in various releases to the customer base.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of David Ferreiro with Oppenheimer.", "David Ferreiro - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "All my questions have been answered.", "Operator", "The next question is from the line of Ross Muken with Deutsche Bank.", "Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "This is Vijay in for Ross. Couple of quick housekeeping questions. Could you quantify the impact of the Russian order in the Q, and well as, what was the benefit from M&A?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So the impact of the Russian order was about $9 million in sales at standard margins.", "Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And M&A?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "And the M&A, it was -- the only M&A that we had it would have been Ion Torrent, and it's $20 million in sales associated with Ion in the quarter.", "Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sure. And maybe one, big, big picture question. And I'm just trying to dig through Ion Torrent and given the [indiscernible] commentary on the industry excess capacity, sort of how are we supposed to think about ramp up of Ion Torrent, is it sort of in the key sense lapse depending on common funding or are people sort of making bets based on excess capacity? And how are we to think about Ion Torrent's?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, this is Mark. And the way you should really think about it -- there's a high end genome center market, which we're seeing less demand in that high-end capacity whether there is already a lot of capacity. Where you should look for the Ion Torrent and PGM is really this new market of desktop sequencing where researchers for $50,000 can really get going with a next-generation sequencing market, get a very fast turnaround, get a sequence run in 2 hours. And that's the market that we are seeing great adoption, and really is the market that were penetrated today with a QPCR and CE, and that's thousands, and tens of thousands of units around the world. So that's the market we see for this product in the next couple of years.", "Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Sure. Maybe if I could just sneak in one last question. Could you sort of give some color on what royalty roll-off would be next year?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "The royalty roll-off, is that what you've said?", "Vijay Kumar - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. We've indicated earlier that the royalty roll-off will be in the range of around $30 million.", "Operator", "And we have a follow-up question from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just one for Mark. Has any of the developments in particular Wildfire portable over to the PGM? And can you also comment on how the grand challenges are being received, I mean, are you actually getting active suggestions from users about improving instrument?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, yes. Certainly on the first one, a lot of the improvements that we see as we've really simplified the upfront sample prep, are getting a lot of synergy now. Not only do you see Wildfire, and you see what we've done with the OneTouch. If you also look what we've done with the AmpliSeq technology that uses our QPCR expertise to really make the sample prep really straightforward, so we can get a one-day targeted sequencing protocol. So the progress we've made, and sort of comment to the second part of your question with this quarterly releases, every quarter we release new milestones on the competition guidelines. So we have set a really high bar for people just in the progress that we've in delivering on this milestone. We do have tremendous interest. We have more than 1,000 people registered in the competition, and so we're really looking forward to paying that out and having even greater improvement and that's what the competition is all about. Obviously, we'll continue to raise the bar each quarter with what our internal team is doing.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then you talked at ASHG about submitting PGM for a 510(k) approval next year. Just -- can you just talk about how you're seeing that fitting into the diagnostic landscape, relative to CE and some of the other technologies?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, we see that the PGM roadmap would be -- we submit during next year and we would expect to get first clearance in Europe with CE-IVD and then in 2013, a 510(k). We see it fitting where customers really want a fast turnaround time in some of these experiments where they have a set of genes that they'd want to do in one go and those are the applications that we'll look to develop on a diagnostic application. Where we see CE, maybe there's 1 or 2 genes that they want to do or you have long reads like we've submitted the CE -- the 510(k) that is currently under review with the FDA is in transplant diagnostics, where CE is well-established as a gold standard in that HLA testing.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And just one last quick one. We're seeing a lot of emphasis on informatics by users and the industry in general, can you just talk to your efforts there and offsetting both the data storage and then the analysis burden?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, one of the key things we've done with Ion Torrent is, make available the standard file formats, and we have a growing user community, developing tools and applications on this standard format with Ion Torrent. And so, that's really helping to address some of the user-community needs. In addition, we're highly focused on the internal algorithms, compressing data, as well as we're developing a software package to allow particularly the cancer research as we do this end-to-end workflow to go all the way from taking a block out of a cancer sample and an FFPE sample, all the way through to analyzing that data in a genome panel set. So that's some of the development that we're doing and presented at HSG.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First off, on the Ion Torrent earnout, just wondering if there's anything remaining there? And if so, how would that be broken out between cash and stock?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Dave?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "At this point, the milestones have been met and the payment is 60% cash, 40% stock. And the repurchase that we did essentially offsets the stock portion of the earnout -- final outcome payment.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's great. And then secondly, on Cell Systems, you obviously -- strong report there, at least versus my numbers, and I'm wondering if there are any unusual items beyond what you mentioned in the press release, you mentioned an improvement in Asia. Is there anything specific there that maybe tied to the improvements you're making China or was it really, more of just, sort of regional strength for that business?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I think there was just overall good performance by that set of products.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And it\u2019s not something that -- I know it can be a lumpy business. How should we think about that business pacing throughout the next few quarters. Anything ahead that would sort of imply a pivot in the trend line we're seeing here?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, other than BioProduction, as we've always said is a bit of a lumpy business, which would then impact that overall growth rate quarter-to-quarter, but any other factor beyond that, we're not aware of.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Long term, we've always said, Isaac, that is a growth rate that's in the high-single digit range over a 2-year period. We've been through a period now where we had just exceptional growth, we're not expecting it to continue forever, but we don't see any dramatic change in the quarter or 2.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Nandita Koshal with Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, I'll start with a few Ion Torrent questions. Mark, if you could talk about the proportion of Ion Torrent systems that have been placed, now that you have a fairly large installed base, the proportion that are in current or pre-existing life sequencing customers versus new customers for Life?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, we have not broken out those proportions, but I can tell you it's very widely distributed, and really I think, you got to look -- nearly all customers will probably have Life a product already since we have such a broad portfolio. There are many that are new to next-generation sequencing, because before, they just couldn't afford the kind of capital involved in a large purchases of a next-generation or the complexity. So there are definitely new customers in that set.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I see. And maybe it\u2019s -- more qualitatively comment on the split between research labs and maybe diagnostics uptick there, and if there's any change in the distribution strategy for Ion Torrent versus the old sequencing systems?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes. Today, the majority is still being used in research labs and in some of the work that is being done in labs that are intended to, later validate into diagnostic use. But the majority today is a research, but clearly the trend as we look out, and the reason we've laid out a pathway to work with the FDA and other regulatory authorities is to take this into the clinical setting as we think the rapid turnaround time of this technology, particularly as you look at trying to turnaround in a day, will be ideal for a clinical setting.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Right. And then I think from a growth margin perspective, a couple of questions on sequencing business as well. One, in terms of Ion consumables, I'm assuming those are fairly high gross margins, where is the installed base in terms of ramping up to that 60,000 to 70,000 run rate that you talked about? And then are there any 5500 upgrades still in the pipeline?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "So on the first part, I mean the user base is just ramping up. Now as I mentioned, we are at about $50,000 for the install base for this third quarter. So we're just beginning to ramp and users getting used to their systems and getting running on their systems. So we're at the beginning of that phase. With regard to 5500 we've almost cleared the backlog of upgrades. We will have that complete during this quarter. And then we'd expect the consumable usage to come up as those customers get up and running on their new systems.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Okay, that's very helpful. And maybe David sort of a segue on the gross margins there. I guess you said PCR instruments and some of the instrumentation heavy nature of Q4 should be up, bit of a source of pressure plus Ion Torrent. Is there anything else that is a major dynamic we should think about sequentially on the gross margin? And then just long term, could you talk about a target run rate of cost savings from the restructuring program?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "No. Other than what you said, in terms of the increased instruments sales in the fourth quarter, that's the primary driver, and the primary driver of that is Ion Torrent. So that's the sequential -- again difference in terms of the potentially lower gross margin in the fourth quarter. And then as I mentioned earlier in the call, the impact of the restructuring actions that we're taking this year on next year, a good estimate at this point in time is we've said that we are targeting $10 million to $20 million in the cost to take out in the second half of this year, and so you could take whatever we end up with this year and apply it to next.", "Agnes Lee", "Vivian, we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Sam Leenert with Leerink Swann.", "Unknown Analyst - ", "I'll squeeze 2 into my one. Can you remind us what the tech milestones were for Ion Torrent, where those milestones sited as the 318 chip or something beyond? And then follow-up regarding the molecular, or the companion diagnostics agreement you announced today, can you help us understand your thinking on the build versus buy decision in molecular diagnostics? Do you have all the internal capabilities to build a companion diagnostics standalone business internally?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So on the first one, we have not disclosed the elements of that milestone. And so, we'll stay consistent with the policy. On the second one, in terms of companion diagnostics, we think we actually have probably the best toolkit of any company that is talking to pharmaceuticals -- entities, because it ranges from QPCR platforms that are the most prevalent in the world to the CE platform, also incredibly prevalent, now Ion Torrent. And obviously, an incredible background of 1,500 scientist. And so I think we present ourselves with high degree of credibility and an installed base that really helps them wanting to get these companion diagnostics distributed when their drug gets approved. So, as I've said in the script, this is -- it's not the first, but it's one we wanted to announce and there will be more announcements though in the future.", "Agnes Lee", "This concludes our Third Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call.

My name is Tahicia, and I will your operator for today. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this call is being recorded for replay purposes. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin your call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until November 18, 2011. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

", "Also during this call we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information. ", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our earnings call for the third quarter of 2011. Let me start by saying that we had another quarter of excellent earnings growth, with a 23% increase in adjusted EPS over 2010. We reported double-digit adjusted EPS performance every quarter this year, and our teams did an outstanding job in executing their operating plans to deliver on our goals again this quarter. As I've been saying for the past couple of years, Thermo Fisher is committed not only to delivering strong growth in adjusted EPS, but to do so consistently. Our results in Q3 clearly continued that trend. In fact, on a year-to-date basis, adjusted EPS is up 19%. ", "Our 3 drivers of adjusted EPS growth haven't changed. They are: 1, top line growth through new product innovation, expansion in emerging markets and our efforts to leverage our unmatched commercial reach to gain share; 2, our focus on operational excellence through PPI and PPI Lean, as well as low-cost region sourcing and manufacturing; and 3, our ability to effectively deploy our capital to create shareholder value.", "All of this added up to a third quarter record of $1.7 in adjusted EPS. Before I cover our EPS drivers in more detail, let me point out that we also delivered excellent adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter, with an increase of 120 basis points to 18.4% over the same quarter last year. This margin improvement was a significant contributor to our strong EPS performance in Q3.", "So turning to the top line, the first key contributor to our EPS growth. We achieved a 13% increase in revenues for the quarter to $2.97 billion. Let me give you some color on what we're seeing in our businesses. ", "Starting with our business in serving the industrial sector. We performed well across our portfolio, with strong revenue and bookings consistent with what we've been seeing all year. Our process instruments for materials and mineral applications performed very well in Q3. We also had another strong quarter for our handheld analyzers, continuing the great momentum we've had here for quite some time. ", "Across our Specialty Diagnostics businesses serving the healthcare industry, growth was driven by our various share gain initiatives. We saw a strong demand again this quarter for our clinical diagnostic products, driven by sales of our biomarker tests to detect sepsis and our test kits for drugs of abuse. We were also pleased to see good growth in the quarter in our Microbiology business, as well as our healthcare customer channel. Our new immuno diagnostics business, formerly Phadia, is off to a great start as well, with growth in excess of 10%. I'll give you an integration update in a few moments.", "Moving on to Pharma and Biotech, we had a number of highlights in the quarter. As we've seen throughout the year, both our Biopharma Services and our Bioprocess Production businesses once again had a strong quarter. Our Pharma and Biotech customers are collaborating much more closely with us to drive productivity by leveraging our industry-leading services capability, which I'll talk about more later in the call. I'm also pleased to note that our HPLC business, which was dramatically strengthened through the Dionex acquisition, is clearly gaining share, with strong double-digit revenue growth.", "The one notable headwind that we had to manage through in the third quarter was the academic and government market segments. As Pete and I mentioned in the September Investor Conferences that we attended, we began to see a softening in demand from the quarters in the U.S. and Europe late in the quarter. We've implemented a number of cost-reduction initiatives to mitigate the effect on our bottom line results, and we are continuing to drive additional actions in Q4. We have also put in place very targeted share gain action plans to maximize our performance in this segment, given our capabilities to help our customers meet their own productivity goals. ", "Let me make a quick comment on our top line growth from a geographic perspective. Our progress in leveraging our industry leadership in emerging markets is clearly paying off. We again performed very well in our Asia-Pacific countries, including China and India, both growing at above 20% in the quarter. ", "I just got back from China a couple of weeks ago where I met with a number of our customers who showed great enthusiasm about working closely with us. In fact, we're collaborating with our customers in the Biopharma, environmental and healthcare markets to develop comprehensive product and services solutions tailored to meet their specific needs. I was very impressed by the excellent progress our teams there are making with these initiatives.", "Turning to new products. We had a steady stream of new launches in the quarter. Let me give you some of the innovation highlights under our Thermo Scientific brand. First, our Specialty Diagnostics business launched 2 chemistry analyzers. One is called Indigo, a fully automated compact chemistry analyzer that recently received clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for routine clinical chemistry administrations. The Indigo analyzer supports our specialty assays business, where we have leadership positions in drugs of abuse testing and therapeutic drug monitoring. This was part of our strong new product lineup at AACC, the leading conference for clinical laboratory professionals and clinical researchers. ", "Our other new chemistry analyzer, the Gallery Plus, was launched specifically for food, beverage and water analysis. The Gallery Plus is ideal for high-volume labs because customers can simultaneously analyze several parameters from a single sample.", "Turning to our lab equipment business, we introduced a whole new platform in our ultralow temperature freezer line. This platform provides sample storage and protection and a variety of capacities while setting new standards for energy efficiency and space utilization for any lab looking to improve productivity. Given our industry leading position in lab equipment, this is a significant platform launch for us.", "Finally, on analytical instruments. During our second quarter earnings call, we highlighted that we launched several significant new mass spectrometer products at ASMS in Q2. I'm pleased to report that there has been a lot of interest in and adoption of our new Q Exactive hybrid mass spectrometer.", "Let me turn to our second key EPS growth driver, operational excellence. You know our strong track record around productivity, which continues to give us the ability to leverage our top line growth for strong bottom line results. We have a number of levers we could pull to protect the bottom line. Given the revenue headwinds that we saw in academic and government markets late in the third quarter, we've increased our activities here. Let me cover 3 of the productivity levers that I consider to be the most important. ", "First, PPI and PPI Lean. As you know, practical process improvement is ingrained in our company culture. At this point in the year, we've generated more than $60 million of productivity savings and we continue to ramp up our PPI project activity to streamline our processes and better serve our customers. ", "Second, low-cost region manufacturing. We typically save 20% to 30% by manufacturing in low-cost regions, primarily China, Mexico and Eastern Europe. To remind you, only about 10% of our manufacturing revenue comes from these regions, so we still have plenty of opportunity here. ", "And third, facility rationalization. We continue to focus on improving our revenue facility and constantly re-evaluate our global footprint to improve our cost structure and strengthen our global competitive position. So still a lot of opportunity for productivity gains in all of these areas. ", "Our ability to translate top line growth into strong bottom line results has always been a key strength of our company. When market conditions become a bit more challenging, our productivity levers are a particular advantage for us.", "Moving on to our third key driver of EPS growth. We continue to create value for our shareholders through effective capital deployment. First, a quick update on Dionex. The integration is continuing to progress very well. The business delivered good growth and profitability, and as I mentioned earlier, we're especially pleased with the early momentum we're seeing in our HPLC share gain initiatives. The cost and revenue synergies are right on track with our plan and we benefited from tax efficiencies as well. ", "The most recent highlight, of course, is the acquisition of Phadia. With our new allergy and autoimmunity diagnostic testing business, which we completed that in late August. We've been talking a lot about Phadia since we first announced the deal back in May, so I'm not going to go into the details again today. But I do want to mention here that the integration is going very smoothly and the business is continuing to deliver strong growth, so it's off to a great start. I did participate in our day 1 integration activities in Sweden and Germany, and there was tremendous excitement about the potential that this combination has to offer our customers. We will be able to provide them with innovative new tests based on Phadia's robust R&D pipeline and we can continue to use our strong presence in Asia-Pacific to being these tests to customers in emerging markets, while leveraging our healthcare customer channel in the U.S. as well. ", "I want to welcome our new colleagues at ThermoFisher, and we're looking forward to working together to strengthen our presence in these high-growth markets. As you saw in our announcement a couple of weeks ago, following the close of Phadia, we established a third reporting segment for our Specialty Diagnostics business. This took effect in Q3. Pete will go into the details, but I want to make a point here that we've made this change to give our investors greater visibility in all 3 of our major businesses. This new reporting structure highlights our Specialty Diagnostics capabilities, which now total more than $2 billion in revenue, as well as our high-growth Analytical Technologies and market-leading Laboratory Products and Services businesses. ", "Clearly, it's been a productive year so far for M&A. But I also want to highlight that we continue to deploy our capital to buy back our stock. In the third quarter, we spent $225 million to repurchase 4 million shares. For the first 9 months of this year, we spent nearly $1 billion to repurchase 17.4 million of our shares. So we continue to be focused in generating strong returns by effectively deploying our cash flow and balance sheets to create value, both with M&A and share buybacks.", "Switching gears, I'll now highlight a key growth theme as I've done every quarter to illustrate how we really leverage our unique depth of capabilities for the benefit of our customers. As you know, pharmaceutical companies continue to look for ways to reduce their cost structure and increase productivity. While outsourcing has become a standard practice in some industries, it's going a step further in the pharmaceutical industry. You've heard me talk about our relationship with Eli Lilly and the extent to which we support their clinical trials operations with materials manufacturing, packaging and labeling at their technology center in Indianapolis. What you may not be aware is the fact that we haven't even brought our managed services model that we're rolling out the pharmaceutical customers large and small. Our value proposition here is that we can offer a range of expertise and support to reduce their time and cost of lab operation so they can focus on the science, innovation and commercialization of new drugs. This managed services model incorporates our vast experience in designing and maintaining scientific labs for a variety of organizations. ", "We've developed a list of nearly 50 standard operating procedures that when implemented, ensure that a lab is operating as efficiently as possible. In fact, our managed services capabilities and the opportunity associated with it is not limited to the pharmaceutical industry. We recently signed an agreement with a major industrial company to develop a comprehensive chemical management program at a new R&D site being built in the southwest. ", "Our long-term goal is to build sustainable relationships with key customers and bring added value to their business through innovative products, world-class service and support. ", "Before I hand the call over to Pete, let me give you an update on our annual guidance for 2011. As you saw on our press release, we are revising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect our market outlook at this point in the year, including less favorable foreign exchange rates. The change in guidance is driven primarily by our assumption that the softer academic and government market environment that we saw in the U.S. and Europe late in the third quarter will continue throughout Q4. ", "In the U.S., customer funding is impacted because the government is still operating under a continuing resolution authority and European governments are still sorting out their budgetary responses to the fiscal situation there. As I mentioned earlier, we are taking swift cost actions to offset these pressures on our top line to protect our bottom line earnings growth. ", "With this backdrop, we're revising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $4.11 to $4.17 for the full year in 2011. This would result in 19% to 21% growth over our strong 2010 results. We are also revising our annual revenue guidance and now expect to achieve a range of $11.62 billion to $11.70 billion for 10% to 11% revenue growth over 2010.", "So let me summarize my remarks this morning with a few key points. We had another quarter of excellent earnings growth with strong double-digit adjusted EPS performance and 120 basis points of margin expansion. We delivered good growth at the top line despite pressure from academic and government markets. We'll continue to manage our cost base to reflect the current environment, and we're committed to building on our strong momentum in new products and emerging markets. ", "Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Mark. Good morning, everyone. As you know, we completed the acquisition of Phadia in August. Similar to our reporting of Dionex, given the significant size of this investment, we're providing visibility to the revenue growth performance of the combined companies by calculating organic growth on a pro forma basis as if Phadia were owned for the entire third quarter and both years. As Marc mentioned, following the acquisition, we established a new reporting structure to provide visibility into our company, highlighting our leading capabilities in all 3 segments: Analytical Technologies, Specialty Diagnostics and Laboratory Products and Services. This structure is also aligned with the way we manage these businesses to best serve our customers and to capitalize on our growth opportunities. So effective this quarter, I'll be providing details on all 3 segments later in my comments.", "We're pleased to report another quarter of strong adjusted earnings per share with 23% year-over-year growth to a third quarter record of $1.7 compared to $0.87 last year. GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.69, up 5% from $0.66 in the prior year's quarter, including acquisition-related costs for Phadia.", "Moving on to our top line performance, reported revenue increased 13% year-over-year to a third quarter record of $2.97 billion. On a pro forma basis, as if both Dionex and Phadia were owned for the entire third quarter and both years, total revenue increased by 7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 3%. In addition to the organic growth, Q3 pro forma revenue increased by 3% as a result of favorable foreign currency translation and another 1% from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia. Bookings were essentially in line with revenue in the quarter. ", "Now let me cover our revenue performance by each of the 3 segments. First, Analytical Technologies Q3 revenue grew 22% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, including Dionex, Analytical Technologies revenue increased 9% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 5%. In the quarter, we continue to see strong growth in our instrument businesses serving industrial and applied markets. Also, our Biosciences business, particularly our bioprocess production products continued to deliver strong year-over-year growth. Growth in this segment was, however, affected by challenging conditions in academic and government markets in the U.S. and Europe, as Marc referenced in his comments.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Q3 revenue grew 20% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, including Phadia, Specialty Diagnostics revenue increased 11% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 6%. In this segment, we continue to see strong growth in clinical diagnostics, specifically our biomarkers business and Phadia, now called immunodiagnostics, delivered better than 10% growth. We also had mid-single digit growth in our channel businesses serving healthcare markets, which is also a part of this segment. ", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q3 revenues increased 5% on a reported basis and grew 1.5% organically. This segment has the highest exposure and was most affected by academic and government markets, although our Biopharma Services business continued to deliver strong growth.", "By geography, we continue to see organic growth in the high teens in Asia-Pacific. China and India again performed very well, with both growing above 20% as Marc mentioned. North America and Europe both grow on the low-single digits and rest of world declined in the mid-single digits versus a tough comparison of high 20s growth in the prior year's quarter.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, we had strong bottom line results, with Q3 adjusted operating income up 21% year-over-year to $547 million. Adjusted operating margin was 18.4%, up 120 basis points from 17.2% in the year-ago quarter. Year-over-year margin expansion was driven by pull-through on organic growth and strong contribution from our cost-productivity actions. And we continue to see nice accretion in the quarter from our recent acquisitions.", "However, similar to last quarter, we continue to encounter inflationary pressure in some of our direct material costs, particularly oil-based raw materials like plastic resin, which we partially offset with additional global sourcing initiatives. We also began to implement incremental restructuring actions and discretionary cost controls this quarter in response to the more challenging market conditions. These totaled about $30 million in annualized benefit over and above our normal productivity efforts driven through PPI and PPI Lean projects. ", "By segment, Q3 adjusted operating income and Analytical Technologies increased 36% year-over-year and adjusted operating margin was 19.5%, up 210 basis points versus last year. In Specialty Diagnostics, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 27% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin at 24.4%, up 140 basis points from the year-ago quarter.", "And then Laboratory Products and Services segments, Q3 adjusted operating income grew by 6% with adjusted operating margin at 13.5%, slightly above the year-ago quarter. ", "Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin was 43.6% in Q3, up 190 basis points from the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by our productivity actions and global sourcing initiatives, which were partially offset by raw material inflation and some unfavorable product line mix. Gross margin was also benefited from the accretive impact of recent acquisitions.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 22.3% of revenue, 50 basis points higher than 21.8% last year, driven by the dilutive impact of our acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered good year-over-year margin expansion as we continue to tightly control discretionary cost and restructure our cost base.  R&D expense was 2.9% of revenue in Q3, up 20 basis points from last year as a result of our growth investments and our recent acquisitions.", "Moving below the line, our Q3 net interest expense increased $27 million year-over-year to $43 million, driven by higher interest expense as a result of issuing debt to fund the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions. This was partially offset by higher year-over-year interest income due to larger average cash balances and slightly higher interest rates on foreign cash.", "Adjusted other income was a $2 million loss versus $1.8 million income in the prior year, primarily as a result of some favorable items in the prior year.", "Adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 18.5%, down 110 basis points from last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives, including tax synergies related to the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions. And during the quarter, we deployed $225 million of our cash to buy back 4 million shares of our stock, which left $250 million remaining at the quarter end under our current $750 million authorization that expires in February 2012.", "Average diluted shares were 383 million in the quarter, down 22 million or 5% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 and 2011 share buyback programs, as well as redemption of our convertible debt.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver solid cash flow performance. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $1.04 billion. Free cash flow was $862 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $179 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was flat year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher operating income and improved working capital performance, offset by higher interest payments and the timing of cash taxes. We ended the quarter with $900 million in cash and investments, down $500 million from Q2, primarily as a result of closing Phadia.", "Total debt was $7.1 billion, up $3.1 billion from Q2 as a result of issuing $2.1 billion of senior notes and $1 billion of commercial paper to fund the Phadia acquisition. ", "And now moving on to our guidance for 2011. As Marc mentioned, since we last provided guidance in August following the Phadia acquisition, our academic and government markets have become more challenging and foreign currency exchange rates are less favorable. As a result, we're lowering the midpoint of our 2011 guidance range by $180 million to a new range of $11.62 billion to $11.70 billion. This range represents growth of 10% to 11% over our 2010 reported revenue of $10.57 billion.", "In terms of pro forma revenue growth including Dionex and Phadia, the midpoint of our revenue -- reported revenue guidance represents about 6% growth. This translates to midpoint organic growth for the year of about 3%, excluding favorable foreign currency of 2% and completed acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia of 1%. As I mentioned last quarter, the Biosite and Japan stimulus headwinds we experienced in the first half have a negative impact of about 1% on our full year 2011 organic growth.", "Moving to our earnings guidance, primarily as a result of our revised revenue outlook, we're slightly lowering the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.06 to a new range of $4.11 to $4.17, which still represents very strong growth of 19% to 21% over our 2010 adjusted EPS of $3.46. This guidance includes our completed acquisitions and it does not include any other future acquisitions or divestitures. ", "In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2011 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend of the relative strength of our markets in the fourth quarter. ", "In terms of some color on below the line items, our full year adjusted income tax rate is now expected to be 19% to 19.5%, slightly lower than last year and our previous guidance, primarily as a result of incremental tax synergies related to Dionex and Phadia. And our full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 383 million to 387 million, down slightly from our previous range. This estimate assumes that we'll use the remaining $250 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration in February 2012. ", "Bridge the $0.06 change from the midpoint of our previous guidance to our current guidance. We lost about $0.12 as a result of lower revenue, offset by incremental cost actions of $0.03 and a net improvement and below the line items, including our adjusted tax rate and a lower share count of another $0.03.", "As I mentioned earlier, we've already begun executing incremental restructuring actions and strict discretionary cost controls, which helped us deliver strong financial results and year-over-year margin expansion this quarter. We're also implementing additional cost actions in the fourth quarter to further align our cost structure with our current outlook. ", "Finally, we continue to reap the benefits of our investments in new products and services, as well as our industry leading presence in Asia-Pac and other emerging markets, all of which position us well for future growth. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "On the outlook, so I think Pete, you mentioned it was a $0.12 delta on revenue and you're offsetting some of it with cost. That seems like a pretty big delta given we only have half the year to go. So in terms of when you started to see some of the shift in demand on the revenue line and sort of the magnitude, I guess, what was sort of most surprising to you in terms of trend? And then in sort of the  inference for organic growth for Q4, it seems like you're implying something in the very low single-digit range despite an easier comp. And I guess, the assumption there is you saw some weakness in Q3 and then things are expecting to kind of continue or worsen to Q4. Is that a correct characterization or not?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So there\u2019s a lot embedded there, Ross. Let me try to break it down into the pieces. In terms of what we saw from a timing perspective, we really saw academic and government weakened later in Q3. And order of magnitude, we saw mid-single digit decline for academic and government in the third quarter, which prior for our first 2 quarters even through July and parts of August, you're looking at low-single digit growth, so a very large swing in actually what happened in Q3. So that's the magnitude of that. In terms of organic growth outlook for the fourth quarter, it's 2% to 3% is what we're looking at for the fourth quarter at this point. So it's really been -- looking at academic and government and given the shortfall of late in the quarter, we've assumed that that's going to continue. As I mentioned in the opening comments, there's not a huge catalyst for change if you all listen in my mind in the fourth quarter because the U.S. is still going through the continuing resolution authority right now, and that's going to put a dampener in the short term on the academic and government markets. And Europe, as you see in the headlines everyday is still going through its fiscal response to the problems that is happening in southern Europe. So very short-term  catalysts. We're not assuming they're going to change a lot and hence, we're reflecting that in our outlook.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I guess, in terms of going back to the Analyst Day and the early color you gave on 2012 were obviously a little bit of a different jump-off point, a few things have happened. But as I think about your sort of your core end markets going into next year versus what your expectation when you first gave some color, obviously, government and academic seems to be a delta for the worse. Are there any other markets where you feel like either performance is better or worse than what you what you had expected when you originally gave that color?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Let me comment, Ross, on what we're seeing broadly in the markets and some more detail. At a high level, our markets in Q3 were very similar to what we've seen in the last few quarters with the obvious exception of academic and government. So I'm not going to delve into that because we just talked about it. But in industrial and applied markets, third quarter is very strong for us, both in revenues and in bookings across the broad base of our businesses. We're obviously following the external factors quite closely and we're monitoring the market, but the third quarter was strong for us. So if you're thinking back to May, we're sitting here in October, industrial very similar. In terms of Biopharma, for us, Ross, that grew a little bit better than the company average. The 2 businesses that we've been highlighting all year continue to perform strongly, and we're benefiting from the fact that we helped our customers drive their own productivity, which is why we've done well in this segment. So I'd say that Pharma biotech hasn't changed a lot for us as this year has unfolded. And healthcare and diagnostics, that's been pretty consistent demand as well. Growth in specialty diagnostics for us was driven both by market growth as well as our share gain initiatives. So if I think about the whole year, 3 of our 4 customer segments representing roughly 75% of our business, pretty consistent, and 1 segment under very significant pressure relative to what we have seen in May. So that's our view on where we are with the end markets.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So as we look at the implied guidance, it looks like $1.13, $1.19 for EPS, that's still be about 18% to kind of 20-some percent EPS growth year-on-year for that quarter. So Marc, given what you're seeing in the academic, let's say that 2012's continuation of the trends that you're seeing now, given maybe let's say a low-single digit organic environment, given all the other things you've got with acquisitions and all that, is it still okay to say that you still think that double-digit EPS growth is achievable as we look on to 2012?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So Quintin,  a few things. As you were mentioning on our Q4 outlook, what's implied in the outlook or in the guidance is 19% to 24% EPS growth for the quarter. So another strong double-digit growth for us and assuming, as I mentioned to Ross, 2% to 3% organic revenue growth is what's implied in that. So we're clearly getting a lot of leverage from the top line into the bottom line. In terms of our outlook and guidance for 2012, we're going to do that like we've done in years past, specifically in the beginning of the year. We typically do it in the February timeframe. So we'll go through the process of finishing our own internal operating plans and setting out the EPS objectives. But clearly, as you look at 2012, we bought a lot of shares back. That's favorable. We've been active on the M&A front, both with Phadia and Dionex. Those businesses are both performing very well, right on track with our integration plans. And those 3 actions, in and of itself, will be strong contributors of earnings growth as well as our strong track record of driving margin expansion. So while the specifics were outlined in February as we've done in every other year past, I feel very confident that we're going to have going to have very strong financial performance in 2012.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then one of the other areas of concern is what's the future outlook for China since you just come back. What are you hearing, I mean, from your customers, from the government in terms of kind of the near and midterm growth outlooks there?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, it's a question that I get asked a lot from our investors, owners. I spend a fair amount of time -- I think I saw it in the range of 30-plus customers when I was in China. And so those customers are excited about doing business with us. Some of them are small customers that want to do a lot more, some are big customers that also are excited about expanding the relationship. Our teams are performing extremely well. We have growth well over 20%. The outlook for strong revenue growth looks positive. So it's harder for us to comment broadly on China, but I can comment specifically on what our business's outlook is, and that looks very encouraging and our team is executing very well.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Marc, probably for Pete too. So if you roll up all of the restructuring you've kind of done in the first half of '11 and then what you've discussed in 3Q and 4Q, taken all over that, rolling it up, what kind of net benefit does that suggest to 2012 in terms of operating profit?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of the total amount of benefit from the actions that we've taken so far including the $30 million that I referenced that we beginning we've initiated since the beginning of Q3, it's about $70 million on an annualized basis. Obviously, we're getting some of that this year, and we'll get some incremental next year. So it's probably a little less than and 1/2 this year and then we get all of it next year, or almost all of it next year. So it's another $30 million to $35 million incremental benefit.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. One quick follow-up. The free chase outlook, could you update us on that? I looks thanks for that. The free cash outlook. Could you update us on that? It looks like your conversion ratio is a bit below the 90%. You've kind of talked about historically. Has something structurally changed in terms of  Phadia or Dionex? And just kind of give us a rule of thumb on how to think about the free cash conversion in 2012.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, I don't think the model has changed. So the assumption of 90% is good. Year-to-date, we've had a little bit of an impact because of timing of cash tax payments. I mean,  we're basically almost paid the full bill through 3 quarters, so we'll get a little of benefit in the fourth quarter. I'd say that the cash flow outlook right across and the free cash basis of that right now on a free cash basis for 2011, probably brackets around $1.3 billion, maybe slightly above that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to run through a little math here. Total academic government as a percentage of sales is right about 20% after the mergers? Is that right?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, it's still close to 23%, 24%.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So low 20s. So if we assume that whole group is down mid-single digits in Q4 along the lines of what you described to happen in Q3. That's about, I think, about $30 million or about 1 point of growth year-over-year. You guys lowered guidance by, I think, it's $180 million at the midpoint. In your response to one  of Ross' questions, you made it seem as no other areas are holding up pretty well. Can you just explain what I'm missing here in terms, including maybe breaking down how much of this change is foreign exchange, how much of it is coming up short of your internal expectations for Q3 and how much of it's Q4?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So the split of the $180 million if you look at it at the midpoint, it's about 1/3 FX and about 2/3 organic. And so that's the 1% organic change from our previous guidance to where we are today. I think the only problem with your math is that you're starting with 0 versus starting with we were assuming some level of growth in academic and government. So the delta is a little bit bigger. As Marc said, we've been clipping along at about low single digits to low end of mid-single digits, and we saw a mid-single digit decline in Q3. So we're expecting comparable growth profile in Q4 versus, obviously, an expectation that we would had some growth.", "Marc N. Casper", "So Doug, it kind of ballpark, you assume about a 7-point delta between what we had been seeing and what we saw in Q3 between low growth versus mid-single-digit decline.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So I know the intent of this new cut of the revenue model is to provide a greater degree of clarity for investors. But at this point, again, maybe I'm just a little slow, but for me, it's a little hard to see what's really going on with the underlying Analytical Technologies and Specialty Diagnostics growth given the new divisional structure and the fact that you're blending Dionex and Phadia into what you're calling adjusted organic growth. For instance, in Specialty Diagnostics, it's hard to see what you did with Phadia. It's hard to see what's embedded in Q4. And I'd say more importantly, it's hard to figure out what's going on with the underlying business. Can you just talk a little bit, I mean, obviously, it would be great if you would break this out. And I think it would be helpful for us and even helpful for you guys. But to the extent you're not going to do that, can you provide a little more guidance on how the underlying businesses, meaning, not Dionex, not Phadia, are holding up to make sure that those are holding the plan?", "Marc N. Casper", "When we acquired Dionex and Phadia, we did the pro forma because effectively, we wanted to give as much visibility to the underlying performance year-over-year. I think what's important to understand in Q3, whether you use the pro forma math or you didn't use the pro forma math, organic growth would've been 3% either way. So it would not have changed the organic growth number from the 3% number for the quarter. So that's at the company level. And Pete, anything you want to comment on the segments?", "Peter M. Wilver", "No. In terms of the segments for Specialty Diagnostics, it's probably about a percentage point or so accretive in the quarter. And then in terms of Analytical Technologies, Dionex is less than 1/2  of percentage point, accretive. And remember, in Analytical Technologies, with Dionex, we do have product substitution issues there which is make that number very hard to figure out. We haven't gone the trouble to try to figure out what if someone had purchased Dionex, HPLC versus a Thermo Scientific one. So just haven't gone through that process to try to determine that.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "If I just look at 2012 and refer back to the Analyst Day in May, is it fair to say you guys still expect call expect call 5% organic growth and 13% to 15% on the EPS line off of the new 2012 EPS guidance range?", "Marc N. Casper", "Well, for the 2011 guidance range?", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I'm sorry, yes. Using the 2011 guidance as a base, is it fair to still look at the framework for 2012 that you offered in May is the right way for next year to shape up?", "Marc N. Casper", "We're going to do our guidance update for 2012 and give our guidance for the year in February,Isaac. So that's the timeframe there. And as I'd mentioned earlier, 3 of our 4 markets are similar outlook, 1 of which is less than -- we haven't finished on our operating plans to determine the right level of growth and margin expansion and EPS assumptions until we go through that process.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And then, Pete, I think I might have missed if you guys updated the tax rate guidance. You guys are obviously turning little below the previous range, you had expected -- wondering if you had an update there?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, the update is we're expecting 19% to 19.5% for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about the demand for some of your short versus your longer cycle capital products, orders were more in line revenue this quarter. So maybe, you could talk geographically and maybe product line between those short- and long-cycle products?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes where you look at the industrial and applied markets, we're really looking at GDP growth and outlook as the key driver, we saw very good demand in terms of bookings for both short, non-cycle products, like handhelds and long-cycle products, like materials and minerals process instrumentations. So that was sort of I was describing the markets for that site. So they're very representative short cycle look good, long lead time, later cycle stuff, look good as well. So very good quarter for Industrial and Applied throughout what we've seen in 2011 so far.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And can you talk geographically, are there any other differences along the same lines?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, we have a very strong presence with Asia-Pacific with our industrial, and that's -- it's been a key beneficiary. So Asia-Pacific is going to be the fastest-growing region like it is for the company. But not any particular nuances that are really materially different in Europe and U.S. as a company as a whole.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Just a question on Phadia, now that Phadia is in your hands, in the U.S. market, do you have any different view of blood-based testing versus skin prick testing and how that conversion -- how quick that conversion take place in the U.S. market?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think the assumptions that we talked about at the time of the acquisition of a slow-but-steady conversation of skin prick to blood base. Nothing has changed in our assumptions there. So we've seen our Immunodiagnostic business, which was formerly Phadia, being a very fast growing business. High single digit, low double- digit type growth business. Really driven by partially the conversion of skin prick testing, but also the increase in asthma and allergy incidents and new products from autoimmune disease and revenue synergies that we get. So we think the business is has very bright prospects.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Marc, there seems to be a greater focus in your commentary around the share gains in the past, and where these gains coming from. It seems it's PLC, but what other areas there and what are you doing to drive that share gain?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so when you look at our commercial reach, it unparalleled in the industry. It's something that we talk about periodically. We probably didn't talk about it as much in the last couple of quarters. But when you look at the various product categories clearly, we gained share in chromatography, which we mentioned in the prepared remarks, but also our healthcare market channel had a very good quarter in the U.S. in terms of performance. Our diagnostics businesses broadly did well, our clinical diagnostics business performed very well in the share gain perspective. And when I look at our performance in certain regions, including country like China or India, I think I feel very confident that we had above market growth through our initiatives there.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And just on the longer-term for margin expansion, is there a lot of upside to that lab products business or it more of a cash cow for you guys?", "Peter M. Wilver", "In terms of margin expansion, you're going to see more expansion in Analytical Technologies and Specialty Diagnostics because within our lab products business, we have our channels business, which margin expansion is going to continue but at a slower rate simply because we don't manufacture all of the products. And Biopharma Services as well, it's more of a people-intensive business. But the Lab products portion of that, where we make equipment and consumables is really very good margin expansion prospects.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And then just finally, Peter, I missed your color on backlog bookings versus revenue?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So I said basically, bookings were in line with revenues in the quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Can you just remind us what the growth rate in China and India has been year-to-date and what was it in 2010?", "Peter M. Wilver", "In terms of growth rate for China and India, both are greater than 20% for the year-to-date numbers. And I don't have it memorized what we did last year, but it was strong -- it was our fastest growing geographies.", "Marc N. Casper", "Stronger this year than it was last year.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, so we accelerated last year.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I guess, the reason for the question is from number -- I guess, as you think about I mean, I know you're not giving me 2012 guidance, but it's -- these regions have been a strong driver of growth and when you're over there, Marc, some other part of the question has been asked, but certainly your expectation that what you're seeing and what you're doing internally able to sustain these types of growth or would you expect some deceleration from the level that you're currently at as I think about those geographies in particular?", "Marc N. Casper", "The way we characterize that -- if you look at our internal plans, so assuming market is exactly the same as it is today in those regions, I believe that we can sustain these types of growth. So if the markets get better, we have higher aspirations that the markets get worse, then you may see those growth rates come down. But of the market condition were exactly as they were today, it's a very good pipeline of initiatives to drive and sustain the types of growth rates you've seen.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And then on the academic and government, if you could just clarify or maybe delineate between instruments and Consumables in terms of what you saw halfway through the quarter and your outlook for the -- thinking about those 2 different segments?", "Peter M. Wilver", "The pressure we're seeing clearly more in the equipment and instrumentation side. I mean, it's broad-based, but it's more definitely heavily weighted towards instruments and equipment and capital purchase decisions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Marc, in the past, I know Fisher has, before it was even owned by Thermo would have a lot of cyclicality and lab equipment, lab hoods, things tied to capacity expansion. Is that the weakest part of what you see in the business right now?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I would say in terms of -- as Pete was just talking about, lab equipment, workstation those types of products clearly are being impacted by weak academic and government funding. And how that really shows up at the detailed level, with the number of large tenders, big projects is a lot less. So you're still getting the small replacement business but the large projects we saw a real slowdown in the third quarter.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And is the math correct that emerging markets are still showing one of your best growth rates for the year?", "Marc N. Casper", "Emerging markets growing very quickly. And as Pete mentioned, we had very strong growth across Asia-Pacific, much, much faster than the company average. So we're seeing excellent performance in our emerging markets.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And your China expansion ahead or right on schedule for what, second half next year in Suzhou?", "Marc N. Casper", "We're due to come online in the second half, which is what we were expecting in terms of it. We just broke ground. So depending on how fast the construction goes, it will happen sometime in the second half.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, what happens after Suzhou? Is it a new plant a year? Is it a new plant every couple of years? How do you grow the business there?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when we look at the growth, manufacturing footprint is part of it, but also it's commercial expansion. So we're not constrained by how fast you put on new factors. I think you'll see us continue to build out our presence in Asia-Pacific from a manufacturing perspective, both to take advantage of the cost, but also to be closer to the customers and deal with the import duties and those types of things. So I don't think it's a factor here, but we've been on the trend for every couple of years expanding our capacity in the region.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries from Bank of America.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I have kind of a multi-parter here so bear with me. So basically since the middle of 2010 in the LPS business, we've had to deal with a number of one-offs and changes. We flew in Biosite and the growth in this business has been choppy to say the least. And now we have more choppiness in terms of the academic funding. I realize that it's workstations and the furniture and a lot of that stuff that the Fisher guys have and the Fisher business which is unpredictable. But I'm worried that over the trend of the last few quarters, we've seen not particularly robust performance out of this business, and I'm just wondering, does this business go back to a point where it's consistently, and I stress the term consistently, delivering kind of a 3% to 4% organic revenue growth rate?", "Marc N. Casper", "Derek, when I look at the Lab Products and Services business, I think that we have good prospects there, right? Is it to have more exposure to academic and government right now and is that a headwind? Sure. But I can associate with big chunks of this business for a decade, and when I look at it, I think that we have the industry leading channel, we'll benefit from expansion in emerging markets where we've had a smaller mix as a percent of the total. So if you think about it, Asia-Pacific is much less of the total of that business in aggregate. So therefore, it doesn't yet enjoy the full impact of the other parts of the business has. So we're expanding that. And if I look at our Biopharma Services business, I see great opportunities to help our pharmaceutical customers. So I do think you'll see that business return to a better growth prospects on a going forward basis", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I guess, with that in mind, can you help us break down what do Biopharma Services do and do in the quarter? There's just one thing I'm trying to get to the underlying growth problem and where the hiccup is and the demand for it. Because I said, if you're telling me that it's all equipment, it's all this and it's not the core consumables that have really been impacted, that's one thing. But I'm worried that we're starting to see weakness in the overall underlying demand for the core consumables.", "Marc N. Casper", "So at a high level, when you go into it, the primary driver of the weakness in the Lab Products and Services business is the equipment of and the capital side for both our channels business and for our Lab Equipment business that's the primary driver of the weakness that we saw.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Nandita Koshal from Barclays Capital.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, my first question would be around academic and if you could give us a little bit more color around which specific product areas -- I know you mentioned instruments versus consumables and instruments naturally being weaker, but which specific product area might have seen a little bit more of an impact? And then looking forward, as you think about the continuing resolution and some sort of finality on the '12 budget as a catalyst or is this really more a [indiscernible] Process, overhang, which may be continues for a few more months. How are you thinking about an infection in that market or some sort of great change?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, I think the way we thought about it is for Q4 we're assuming conditions that we saw in Q3 continuing. And the reason for that is it's hard to say which is the continuing resolution, which is the super committee. I think lack of clarity of budgets is the driver in the U.S. as opposed to this specific budget. And once it gets a little bit more clarity I think customers will have more confidence to spend on bigger ticket items. And as Pete said, as you look to the various mixes of products, it's really around the instrumentation equipment was more affected in the academic and government in the consumables portion.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Was it also areas like mass spec for instance like where you've seen some of the other players come up with a little bit positive commentary? Of course, it could be an academic or outside. But could there be some sort of competitive dynamic there?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, when you look at the types of instruments that we make that are sold to academic and government, that ranges from spectroscopy instruments, that ranges from spectrometers, it's our chromatography instruments, it's our lab equipment that's a range of products you might see in those customers. Do I think it's a competitive dynamic? No, I think it's a market-based dynamic, is what we're facing.", "Nandita Koshal - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I guess, if you could clarify, why do you think you guys saw a little bit of a lagged impact? In some of the company's in the space even started seeing the effect in Q2. Is there some sort of explanation or is this random?", "Marc N. Casper", "What we said in Q2, the effect that we saw was we were expecting a bit of a pickup in Q2. We didn't see it. But we didn't see the decline so I can't -- it's hard to comment on anybody else because if look at what you did say and expect versus what happened. What I can say is that we saw not a pickup in Q2, that we were expecting, that's why we articulated in July and we're expecting it at that lower rate of growth to continue, and we actually saw it go from that low growth to mid-single digit shrink. So it's hard for me to comment on anybody else's because I don't know what their expectations were.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Operator, we have time for just one more  question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I actually want to follow up on the last question because I think it's an important point. I mean, most of your peers or a great numbers peers a great number of peers were pretty cautious around the second quarter talking about the academic softness and you seem to be a little bit more confidence, obviously, with Phadia closing. You bumped numbers up. So can you just talk to your visibility in the economic channel because you seem to have gotten caught flat-footed in kind of mid-September and what steps can you take to try to kind of buck the trend there going forward?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So I think when you look at the outlook for the year, basically, what we said at the beginning of the year in terms of organic growth for the business and margin expansion, we have stayed consistent with that throughout the year. And as you recall back to the very beginning of the year, what we had assumed was the headwinds that we saw in the first half of Biosciences and the Japan stimulus wouldn't happen in the second half. So you'll have easier comparisons. And you'd see a little bit of a pickup in the second half because of that. If you look at the various changes to guidance, we didn't change guidance throughout the year on those factors. So margin expansion and organic outlook stayed consistent with what we said at the beginning of the year. We raised guidance because of foreign exchange, tax rate and the very positive acquisitions that we did. As we articulated in the previous call, in July, what really start saw, Tycho, was we had expected delivered of an improvement in academic and government. It didn't happen. And we've been in this business a long time, and we've really haven't seen a mid-single digit decline quarter in academic, government before. So that happened. And we responded aggressively on managing cost. We have a number of share gain initiatives I feel really good about, that position us well for the future. And like always, we try to provide as much clarity in the process as we possibly can.", "Tycho W Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then can you talk to the cost-control initiatives you announced $15 million to $17 million? Does that impact R&D details and any color by division?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think it's very focused on site consolidations, it's focused on selective restructuring actions in the affected parts of the business. As well and then obviously, as Pete said, some very tight cost controls that we have in place. So those businesses are feeling more pressure. We've taken more aggressive actions. But like everything, I think good cost management is part of managing a business effectively and all of our businesses being beings disciplined on the cost side and are working to drive very strong bottom line performance. So Tycho, thank you for the question. ", "So let me just wrap it up. Thanks for joining us. When I think about where we are, we have a very good track record, a proven track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We demonstrated that again this quarter with 20% growth in earnings. We remained very focused on executing on our plans to achieve our goals for the year. So thanks for your continued support of Thermo Fisher Scientific, and I look forward to updating you on our progress early in the new year.

I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Thank you. Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until March 2, 2012. A copy of the press release of our 2011 fourth quarter and full year earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.

While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. ", "Also, during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2011 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our 2011 fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. As I look back at 2011, it was a year where we significantly advanced Thermo Fisher Scientific's strategic position as the industry leader. And it was another year of consistently executing our proven strategy to create shareholder value.", "In 2011, we delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth, with a 20% increase year-over-year for another record performance. I'm proud of our teams for executing on their plans to translate our top line results into strong bottom line growth.", "You will recall from our Analyst Meeting last year that I said our priority was to consistently deliver strong adjusted EPS growth, and we clearly met that objective again in 2011. Before I cover our achievements for the full year, let's turn to the fourth quarter financials and I'll try to give you a sense of the playing field as we see it based on how our businesses closed out the year.", "As you read in our press release, adjusted EPS for Q4 grew 23% to a record $1.18. Revenues in the fourth quarter increased 15% to a record $3.13 billion. We also expanded our adjusted operating margin by 100 basis points in the quarter to 18.9%.", "We ended the year on a strong note and I'm especially pleased with our top line growth. We came in just above the high end of our expectations due to 3 reasons. First, our teams executed well against their plans. Second, we benefited from early traction on the additional share gain initiatives we put in place in the third quarter, which I'll highlight later in my remarks. And third, while the market conditions played out pretty much as we expected, we did see sequential improvement in the academic and government customer segment later in the quarter.", "Let me take a few minutes to provide an overview of what we saw in our end markets in more detail. Let's start with academic and government. As you recall, we saw a significant slowdown in this end market in Q3. Uncertainty around the future of NIH budgets, as well as the budget crisis in many European countries was causing many of our customers to put their buying decisions on hold.", "In Q4, although conditions got sequentially better, the market was still relatively weak overall. Once the U.S. federal budget for 2012 was passed, with the small increase for NIH, we believe that our customers gained more confidence and that some pent-up demand kicked in late in the quarter, especially in spending for laboratory consumables.", "In addition, we believe that some of our new share gain initiatives began to take hold. By share gain initiatives, I'm referring to our focus on arming our commercial teams with the best products, targeting our sales efforts with the greatest opportunities and then converting those opportunities into revenues by closing sales. Specific examples include our Q Exactive launch, adding new HPLC capabilities from Dionex and leveraging our channels to drive sales of our specialty diagnostic products.", "Turning to Pharma and Biotech, we had a very strong finish to the year in this customer set driven by demand in research, development and manufacturing. In research applications, we had solid momentum in mass spectrometry. I'm especially pleased with the robust demand for our new Q Exactive system, which we believe is already gaining share in the Q-TOF space for protein identification and metabolomic research.", "In drug development, our Biopharma Services business also continues to perform very well. Our value proposition here around outsourcing clinical trials, logistics and packaging, is really resonating with these customers at a time when an increased productivity is critical to their success.", "And in manufacturing, our BioProcess Production products continue to enjoy strong growth. In healthcare and diagnostics, market conditions have remained consistent with what we've seen throughout the year. Demand for our specialty diagnostic products remains strong, especially in our clinical diagnostics business and in the legacy Phadia business now called immunodiagnostics. I'll give you an update on Phadia in a few moments.", "Last, demand from industrial-implied markets generated strong growth in both revenues and bookings during the quarter. As an example, our Process Instruments businesses continued the excellent moment we've seen here all year long.", "So to summarize, academic and government, although still relatively weak, improved sequentially. Pharma and Biotech had a slight uptick and 2 of our end markets, industrial and applied, and healthcare and diagnostics, performed similarly to what we saw in Q3.", "Let me also comment here that from a geographic perspective, emerging markets had another terrific quarter, with China, India and Brazil all reporting better than 20% revenue growth. This is a good time to turn to our scorecard for the year because the progress we made in 2011 sets us up well to meet our growth goals for 2012.", "Looking at our full year financial results, as I mentioned in my opening comments, we delivered 20% adjusted EPS growth to a record $4.16. We grew revenues by 11% to $11.73 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margins for the full year to 18.1%. And finally, we had a strong year for free cash flow generating $1.42 billion. So you can see we delivered solid operating performance and that led to our record EPS results.", "You've heard me talk about the 3 key contributors to growing our EPS, the first is top line growth, the second is margin expansion and the third is effective capital deployment. I used this as the framework for my 2011 overview, with a few highlights of how these achievements ideally position us for growth in 2012.", "First, I'll cover top line growth. As I just mentioned, emerging markets generated strong double-digit growth in the fourth quarter, in line with the trend we've seen throughout the year. Asia-Pacific alone now accounts for 15% of our total company revenues, that's up from 13% in 2010. We're benefiting from our unique scale and depth of capabilities and that is translating into above market growth in India and China, as well as significant growth in Brazil. Our expanding presence in emerging markets will continue to be an important growth driver for us in 2012.", "Another key aspect of our revenue growth, new product innovation, continues to reinforce our position as the technology leader across all of our business segments. We had numerous examples in 2011, let me highlight 3. One is our flagship mass spectrometry launch, the Q Exactive, which integrates a quadrupole mass spec with our leading Orbitrap technology. As I mentioned earlier, the Q Exactive is gaining share for us in the Q-TOF market, which we have not historically participated in. We're very excited about the possibilities and what this means for our customers in both research and applied markets. An example in Specialty Diagnostics is a new version of our market-leading MRSA test that we launched in Europe. This makes screening for deadly hospital-acquired infections even more accurate. ", "And in laboratory products, you may recall that we launched a new line of ultra-low temperature freezers that consolidates all of our legacy product lines into a single platform. With this new platform, we're now able to manufacture high-quality freezers more efficiently and in the regions closer to our customers, which allows us to significantly drive down logistics costs. We will continue our strong momentum in technology innovation in 2012. And I'm looking forward to highlighting a number of significant new products that we'll introduce during the course of the year and major industry events, including PITTCON, Analytica, ASMS and AACC to name a few.", "Another key aspect of our top line growth is how we deliver a unique value proposition to our customers by lowering their costs, improving their productivity, while at the same time accelerating their innovation. One example that I already mentioned is our outsourcing capability through our Biopharma Services business, which had a very strong growth in 2011. A new example is our Unity Lab Services brand, which we officially launched a few weeks ago. We're excited about the potential here because Unity Lab Services combines our extensive instrument and equipment service organizations with our asset management and outsourcing services, now all under a single brand. This covers third-party vendors as well. The ability to bring all these capabilities together is a real differentiator for us in the marketplace. We see this as yet another vehicle for accelerating our top line growth, not only in 2012, but well into the future.", "Let me now turn to our second key contributor to EPS growth, and that's margin expansion. As you know, we have a number of levers that drive our margin performance, including pricing, volume leverage, PPI, our global sourcing efforts, low-cost region manufacturing and restructuring. In a typical year, we generate about 2% of productivity savings from these activities. That was the case in 2011, where we achieved more than $200 million in productivity savings that contributed directly to our bottom line.", "While we're always focused on carefully managing our costs, as economic conditions change, we can quickly adjust by launching additional restructuring actions. For instance, in Q3 and Q4 of 2011, we implemented a number of incremental actions to address the academic and government weakness. This included tightening our discretionary spend, initiating additional site consolidations and targeted workforce reductions in some of our businesses. In 2011, we initiated restructuring activities with an annualized benefit of about $100 million. We realized a portion of that benefit at the end of 2011, and we expect to reap the balance of it in 2012 and a small amount in 2013. I want to point out that these activities are about 2x to 3x what we would do as a matter of course during the year.", "The third key contributor to our EPS growth is effective capital deployment. Here, we focus on our growth investments such as strategic acquisitions, as well as returning capital to our shareholders. You know that we made a number of strategic acquisitions in 2011. Dionex and Phadia were by far the largest, but we also made several smaller acquisitions such as Sterilin and TREK, that added key capabilities to strengthen our competitive position and create value for both our customers and our shareholders.", "Let me take a few minutes to update you on the progress we've made with Dionex and Phadia. First, Dionex, which brought a leading offering of chromatography instruments, software, consumables and services to our Analytical Technology segment. If you remember back when we closed the deal in May of 2011, we outlined about $60 million in the total adjusted operating income synergies by year 3. That included $40 million from cost synergies and about $20 million from revenue synergies. We also plan to gain greater tax efficiencies by leveraging our global financial structure.", "To give you a sense of how we're tracking at this point, in terms of cost synergies, we are ahead of our goal of capturing $15 million in year one. In terms of revenue synergies, our results to date are even better, with us being well ahead of our goal, and we believe we will achieve our year 3 revenue synergy target as early as one year ahead of plan. Our commercial teams are clearly demonstrating to our customers the value we've created by combining Dionex and Thermo Fisher. As a result, we're accelerating our momentum in mass spectrometry, clearly gaining share in HPLC and strengthening our presence in high-growth life sciences and applied markets.", "Turning to Phadia. We closed the acquisition in August of 2011, adding leading specialty in vitro diagnostic products for allergy and autoimmune testing to our portfolio. This meaningfully increased our scale and depth of capabilities in high-growth specialty diagnostic markets. We're only 5 months in, and both the cost and revenue synergies are tracking according to our plans. In terms of upside, we're already seeing significant incremental value from better-than-expected tax synergies, as well as from lower financing costs.", "From the standpoint of returning capital to our shareholders, we deployed $1.3 billion in 2011 to buy back more than 24 million shares of our stock. Even in a year that was very active on the acquisition front, we were able to use our strong cash flow and balance sheet to increase shareholder value, while maintaining our financial flexibility.", "Moving on to our guidance for 2012, let me provide you with a high-level view on our outlook. Pete will get into the details in his commentary, but our general assumption going into 2012 is that our end markets will be about the same as they were in the second half of 2011. Also, given the relative strength of the dollar, we believe we'll face some pretty significant headwinds from foreign exchange.", "With the uncertainty that still exists in the global economy, we are assuming about 3% organic growth for 2012. As I mentioned, we have a number of actions in place to reduce costs, as well as contingency plans that we can quickly implement if end markets get worse. We've also implemented share gain initiatives that will drive our top line growth into the future.  Based on this macro view, let me quickly give our expectations for 2012 adjusted EPS and revenues.", "As you can read in our press release, we expect to achieve adjusted EPS in the range of $4.67 to $4.82 for 2012, which would result in 12% to 16% EPS growth over our strong performance in 2011. In terms of revenue growth, we expect to generate a range of $12.15 billion to $12.35 billion for a 4% to 5% increase year-over-year.", "For the longer term, when market conditions become less choppy, we remain confident that Thermo Fisher is a company that's well positioned to achieve strong mid-single digit organic growth and continue to deliver strong adjusted EPS growth as well.", "So to sum up my remarks, we are pleased to end 2011 with an excellent fourth quarter in both revenues and earnings, and to deliver 20% of adjusted EPS growth for the full year. We believe that our combination of momentum in emerging markets, successful new product launches and strong performance by new acquisitions, coupled with decisive cost actions, positions us well to achieve our goals for 2012.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. We're pleased to report another quarter of strong adjusted earnings per share, with 23% year-over-year growth to a fourth quarter record of $1.18 compared to $0.96 last year. For the full year, adjusted EPS was a record $4.16, up 20% from $3.46 last year.", "GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.77, up 3% from $0.75 in the prior year's quarter. And GAAP EPS for the full year was $3.46, up 37% from $2.53 last year, reflecting the gain on sale of discontinued operations.", "Starting with our top line performance. For the quarter, reported revenue increased 15% year-over-year to a fourth quarter record $3.13 billion. On a pro forma basis in Q4, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned in both years, total revenue increased by 6% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 5%. In addition to organic growth, Q4 pro forma revenue increased by 1% from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia.", "Foreign currency translation had a negligible impact on our reported revenue this quarter, as average foreign exchange rates were essentially flat year-over-year. For the full year, reported revenues increased by 11% year-over-year to $11.73 billion. On a pro forma basis, including the results of Dionex and Phadia, from the beginning of the quarter they were acquired and for the comparable periods in 2010, full year revenue increased by 7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 3%.", "The Japan stimulus and biosite transition headwinds that we experienced in the first half of the year, negatively affected our full year organic growth by about $100 million or 1%. So excluding these 2 items, our full year organic growth was 4%.", "For the year, favorable foreign currency translation increased revenue by slightly more than 2%, and we added a little more than 1% from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia. We continue to strengthen backlog in the quarter, with bookings exceeding revenue by 2% in the quarter and by 1% for the full year.", "Now let me cover our revenue performance by each of the 3 segments. First, Analytical Technologies Q4 revenue grew 23% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, including Dionex, Analytical Technologies revenue increased 8% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was also 8%.", "In the quarter, we continued to see particularly strong growth in our instrument businesses serving industrial and applied markets, and in our BioProcess Production products. Our mass spec and chromatography business also delivered strong year-over-year growth.", "For the full year, Analytical Technologies reported revenue grew 19%. And on a pro forma basis, including Dionex, Analytical Technologies revenue increased 9% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 6%.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, Q4 revenue grew 32% on a reported basis. On a pro forma basis, including Phadia, Specialty Diagnostics revenue increased 7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 6%.", "In the segment, we continue to see strong growth in clinical diagnostics. And Phadia, now called immunodiagnostics, again contributed nicely to growth. For the full year, Specialty Diagnostics reported revenue grew 15%. On a pro forma basis including Phadia, revenue increased 7% year-over-year and organic revenue growth was 4%.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 revenue increased 5% on a reported basis and grew 3% organically. In the quarter, our Biopharma Services business continued to deliver strong growth. However, similar to last quarter, this segment was most affected by the challenging conditions in our academic and government markets, which declined low-single digits in the quarter. For the full year, Laboratory Products and Services revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 2% organically.", "By geography, as Marc mentioned, we continued to see organic growth in the double digits in Asia-Pacific, with both China and India again growing above 20%. North America grew in the low-single digits, Europe in the mid-single digits and rest of world, which is less than 3% of our revenue, declined in the low-single digits versus a tough comparison in the prior year's quarter driven by several large orders.", "For the full year, we also saw double-digit growth in Asia-Pacific, with China and India both growing above 20%. North America and Europe grew in the low-single digits and rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits.", "Turning to adjusted operating income. We had strong bottom line results, with Q4 adjusted operating income up 22% year-over-year to $592 million. Adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, up 100 basis points from 17.9% in the year-ago quarter. The year-over-year margin expansion was driven by pull-through on organic growth and strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions.", "And we continued to see good accretion in the quarter from our recent acquisitions. However, similar to last quarter, we also continued to see inflationary pressure in some of our direct material costs, particularly oil-based raw materials like plastic resin, which we partially offset with additional sourcing initiatives. We also continued to see some pricing pressure on equipment, particularly in our Laboratory Products and Services segment.", "We're executing as planned on the incremental restructuring actions that we talked about on last quarter's call, and realized about $9 million of benefit from those actions in the quarter, over and above our normal productivity and restructuring efforts. During the year, we initiated about $100 million of restructuring actions in response to the tougher market conditions, which as Marc said, is significantly above our normal run rate. I'll discuss the 2012 impact of these and other restructuring actions later in my comments when I talk about our 2012 guidance.", "By segment, Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased 38% year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was 21.1%, up 240 basis points versus 18.7% last year. In Specialty Diagnostics, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 42% year-over-year with adjusted operating margin at 24%, up 180 basis points from the year-ago quarter. And in our Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 adjusted operating income declined by 4%, with adjusted operating margin at 13.2%, 110 basis points below the year-ago quarter.", "We generated strong productivity of over 125 basis points in Laboratory Products and Services, again, this quarter. And we reinvested about 40 basis points into Asia and other growth investments. This net productivity was more than offset by inflation, unfavorable mix and some nonrecurring items.", "For the full year, total company-adjusted operating margin increased to 18.1%, up 75 basis points year-over-year. By segment, full year Analytical Technologies adjusted operating margin increased 170 basis points to 18.7%, Specialty Diagnostics was up 150 basis points to 24.2% and Laboratory Products and Services decreased 50 basis points to 13.7%.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company-adjusted gross margin was 44.3% in Q4, up 170 basis points from the year-ago quarter. Year-over-year, gross margin expansion benefited from our productivity actions and the accretive impact of recent acquisitions, but raw material inflation and mix were dilutive in the quarter.", "For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 43.2%, up 120 basis points from 42% in the prior year. Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22.3% of revenue, 50 basis points higher than 21.8% last year, driven by the dilutive impact of our acquisitions. Excluding acquisitions, we delivered good year-over-year margin expansion, as we continued to tightly control discretionary cost and restructure our cost base.  For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 22.1%, an increase of 20 basis points, again, driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions. ", "R&D expense was 3.1% of revenue in Q4, up 20 basis points from last year as a result of our recent acquisitions. For the full year, R&D was 2.9%, also up 20 basis points or $55 million, driven by our recent acquisitions and slightly increased investments to expand our new product pipeline for the future.", "Moving below the line, Q4 net interest expense increased $35 million year-over-year to $51 million, driven by higher interest expense as a result of issuing debt to fund the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.6%, down 90 basis points from last year as a result of our ongoing tax planning initiatives, including tax synergies enabled by the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 19.1%, at the favorable end of previous guidance and down 80 basis points from 2010. ", "During the quarter, we deployed $350 million of our cash to buy back 7 million shares of our stock. In total, we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 24.5 million shares in 2011. And at the beginning of the year, we had $650 million left against our current authorization that expires in November 2012.  Average diluted shares were 376 million in the quarter, down 23 million or 6% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2010 and 2011 share buyback programs, as well as redemption of our convertible debt. For the full year, average diluted shares were 385 million, down 25 million or 6% from 2010.", "Turning to the balance sheet. Our cash flow was exceptionally strong in Q4. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $1.68 billion and free cash flow was $1.42 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $258 million. Full year free cash flow was up about $250 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher adjusted net income, partially offset by higher cash restructuring. ", "We ended the quarter with $1 billion in cash and investments, up $126 million from Q3. The increase in the quarter was driven by our free cash flow, partially offset by share buybacks and pay down of a portion of our outstanding commercial paper. Our total debt was $7.0 billion, down $100 million from Q3 as a result of paying down outstanding commercial paper.", "Now moving on to our guidance for 2012. We're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $4.67 to $4.82, which represents growth of 12% to 16% over our 2011 EPS of $4.16. In terms of revenue, we're initiating 2011 guidance in the range of $12.15 billion to $12.35 billion, 4% to 5% above our 2011 reported revenues of $11.73 billion. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned in both years, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance is about 3%. Foreign currency, as Marc indicated, is unfavorable in 2012 assuming current rates, resulting in a $400 million year-over-year headwind in revenue and a 4% headwind in adjusted EPS.", "And completed acquisitions, other than Dionex and Phadia, contribute a little less than 0.5% to our expected growth in 2012. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "To give you a little more detail on our earnings guidance, we're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion of 70 to 90 basis points compared to 2011. Positive contributors to our margin expansion are expected to be: pull-through on organic revenue growth at marginal rates; moderate price increases comparable to the environment we experienced in 2011; the full year benefit of our 2011 acquisitions, including incremental synergies; and productivity and cost reduction actions that contribute over 200 basis points including PPI and PPI Lean, as well as low-cost region manufacturing; global sourcing, including low-cost region sourcing, net of direct material inflation; and over $50 million of benefit from the full year impact of the restructuring actions we initiated in 2011, as well as planned actions in 2012.", "These benefits will be offset by normal inflation under indirect cost base, slight margin dilution from foreign exchange given the significant top line impact and some select strategic investments that will drive growth in emerging markets and enhance our customer experience.", "Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be up $55 million to $60 million year-over-year, reflecting the full year interest cost of the debt issued to fund the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions. Our adjusted income tax rate is forecast to be in the range of 17% to 18%, down from 19.1% in 2011, primarily as a result of our continuing tax planning initiatives and tax synergies related to the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions.", "And full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 365 million to 370 million, down 4% to 5% from 2011, which assumes that we'll use the remaining $650 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration in November 2012.", "Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million, and free cash flow to exceed $1.5 billion. In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2012 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year. We set a fairly wide range on revenue at this point given the uncertainty in the global economy, but we're committed to taking the cost actions required to meet our earnings goals. ", "So in summary, we finished 2011 on a strong note. And overall, it was a good year for us. We successfully completed and integrated a number of key strategic acquisitions and we also delivered exceptionally strong adjusted EPS growth, while funding a number of growth investments such as new products and emerging markets.", "And while our academic and government markets continue to face some challenges, we've responded with decisive cost actions and are positioned well to achieve our earnings growth goals in 2012. I'm excited about our growth prospects for the long term and believe that we're continuing to strike the right balance between disciplined cost management and growth investments to maximize our performance. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Obviously, the tone of this call is decidedly better than the last. You gave a lot of commentary, Marc, on the back half sort of changes in some of your end markets. As we head into '12 and you think about sort of the upper and lower ranges in the guidance and what would sort of cause us to maybe get to a level outside of it, I mean where do you see sort of the biggest potential changes as we head into '12 that could cause sort of results to be on either side? Are there 2 or 3 places where you think there's the biggest potential delta, or is it all sort of either moderately better or moderately worse?", "Marc N. Casper", "Ross, thanks. So I would say, the Deltas are really going to be driven by the macro economy either on the favorable or on the unfavorable end. We're assuming muted economic growth globally, no major changes in the academic and government funding environment assumed here that we saw in the second half, which is obviously the weakest environment that we've seen in, certainly in the 10-plus years that we've been at the company. So we're assuming conditions pretty similar to that. And it's really going to be macroeconomic effects, for the positive or negative, that could drive big changes off of that.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "I guess now that you've sort of had time to reflect on sort of Q3 and some of the extraordinary things you saw, and you sort of dug in to kind of some of the reasoning and you gave, obviously, on the academic markets some of the explanation, do you feel like your ability to sort of react to some of these changes now is going to be better? Or in looking back, do you feel as if that was probably not an event that was within any sort of standard deviation of the normal and so, hopefully, not something that likely repeats itself in the future?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think if you think about how well we responded, I think it's actually quite impressive, right? You have unprecedented change in demand. In that quarter we initiated huge amount of restructuring, significant share gain activities and drove the strongest organic growth that we had all year in the fourth quarter with 5% organic growth. So we saw weakness in the second half of Q3 and we reacted on a dime with that. It doesn't mean that you're going to translate those actions into revenue in that first 30-day period, but to see the results coming out, really, right after that, I think is fantastic. So the company is moving well. I'm proud of the 39,000 employees. I mean, a phenomenal effort around the world to deliver just a great finish to the year.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "And I promise the last one, so Pete, just in terms of sort of call outs for this year, I mean we've obviously had the last couple of years, whether it's contract-based or days-based sort of comp effects, anything specific on the sequential sort of progression this year just to keep in mind as we do our models?", "Peter M. Wilver", "No. There's nothing really significant in 2012. The only thing to note is that the headline organic growth numbers that form the compare for 2012 are a little bit misleading because of the prior year comparisons we had in 2010. So it would look like the comps are easier in the first half and harder in the second half, and it's actually opposite to that just because of some of the prior year comps.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Just to clarify, so if we think about it, it's the way the guidance works now it's, just based on that comp effect, you'd assume that you're higher in the first part of the year and lower in the back half the year?", "Peter M. Wilver", "No. The comps are tougher in the first half...", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Yes -- no, organically, right?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. And you're talking about 2011, you mean?", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "'12.", "Peter M. Wilver", "2012, the comps are tougher in the first half, so organically that would make it generally lower in the first half than in the second half.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight of CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Marc, if you think about capital allocations, $650 million left on the buyback, what's your balance right now on capital? Is it a buyback orientation or are you seeing M&A opportunities in the world?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. Paul, thanks for the question. So in terms of our capital deployment strategy, it's been very consistent with a balance of focus on growing the business with acquisitions that meet our criteria and strengthen our company's competitive position, improving the offering from a customer perspective and clearly, creating shareholder value, as well as some return of capital. So what we said when we did our last authorization, is that we're assuming about half of our cash flow is going to be returned in the form of buybacks. And that if acquisitions meet our criteria, then we'll pursue them. As we look at our pipeline, we have a good pipeline. But we're only going to pursue acquisitions that we feel excited about. And we're very focused on executing well against Dionex and Phadia, and the good news there is that they're going well.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Then last, what portion of your CapEx goes to emerging markets this year?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of CapEx, we've got a big facility expansion. But I would say, it's a little more than the weighting of the business. I'd say probably 15% to 20% would be the mix of our CapEx in emerging markets.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just 2 quick questions for me. One, Marc, a lot of us are trying to kind of figure out the whole wind down of the stimulus, and so maybe just kind of talk about how you expect that playing out in 2012? And then the second question, with respect to your commercial strategy, there's a lot of commentary that maybe you might be more inclined to use price as a part of your commercial strategy to gain share. Your gross margins look pretty good in the fourth quarter, so just curious kind of what you see with pricing as you move into 2012?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. Stimulus was not a big factor for us in terms of demand last year. We don't see it as a big effect, obviously, for those customers that had some stimulus funds, they obviously are going to have to find alternative funds, but we don't see that as a big factor in 2012. From a commercial strategy, as certainly you've heard me say for many years, we're very focused on getting appropriate price for our products. So we're not a company that is driving discounting or aggressive pricing behavior. In fact, what we have done in certain customer sets, where they're under more pressures, we've helped them select the right products from a value perspective, but we've been very disciplined on maintaining and maximizing our price.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So if I can just quickly follow-up on that, maybe if you think about your guidance, your op margin guidance for '12 of 70 to 90 bps. I know you don't like to give all the details of the different pieces, but would you expect gross margins to kind of also continue to see the updraft that you've seen over your history?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Jon, this is Pete. So when you look at the pieces of the P&L, the 70 to 90 basis points, it gets a little bit clouded by the acquisition impact because we're going to get a full year of Dionex and Phadia, and both of them had higher than average gross margin and higher than average SG&A and R&D. So what you're going to see is gross margin go up and then also SG&A and R&D percent of revenue go up. But if you take that out of the equation, you would see gross margin improving and SG&A leverage improving and R&D about flat.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess starting with a question on cash deployment. You haven't described anything different from what you've described in the past on today's call. That being said, you completed a series of big deals last year from a financial flexibility and integration perspective. With that in mind, do you feel that you're ready to do another deal of similar size if there were one that made sense for you? And then I guess on the same topic, any change in how you guys are thinking about dividends?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So Doug, in terms of M&A, we follow our criteria strictly. We are focused on executing well against the deals that we completed last year. So that's our priority. We evaluate the various opportunities out there. If the right thing came up, that met our criteria, that was great for our shareholders, we would consider it. But right now, our focus is executing well on what we did. In terms of dividends, if I look back over the years, it's been a very small topic of discussion. There's been a lot more questions about dividend policy over the last 6 to 9 months. It's something that we -- we obviously return a lot of capital to our shareholders and it's a topic that we'll continue to discuss with our board about what's the right mix of return of capital.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then an unrelated follow-up. Marc, again for you. You highlighted successful share initiatives as one of the 3 key drivers to revenue growth in the quarter and in fact, what drove you to exceed the high end of the guidance range. How broad-based were these wins? I know you mentioned some specifics in mass spec and HPLC. But I'm curious if these were much broader than that and how do you think about these heading into next year in terms of what's incorporated into guidance?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, they're focused on a few areas, right, in terms of the ones I highlighted. They were also focused on the fact that we had our commercial teams out in the field with customers. We took out a lot of just the normal routine paperwork and stuff you do and just basically said, \"You know what, Q4, we're going to just focus on our customers and not worry about a lot of those administrative things.\" So that helps as well. In terms of what's in our guidance, we have some great products and some very targeted commercial strategies that's embedded in the guidance. And as we continue to see new opportunities, we'll add them to the mix.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could sneak in one last one for Pete. One of the few blemishes on this quarter, if you will, was maybe the lab products and services operating margin coming in a bit lighter, at least relative to what I was expecting. Anything unusual here? And is this a scenario where you think you can get some material improvement in 2012?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Sure. So as I said in my comments, we did generate strong cost productivity in lab products and services, as the norm. But that was more than offset by -- we had some unfavorable mix and several unfavorable items, a number of which were nonrecurring or the result of year-over-year comparisons. So if you look at the net impact of operational provisions in the quarter, this quarter, this year was negative and last year was positive. So we had sort of the double impact of favorability last year and unfavorability this year. Normally, those things sort of net out to a negligible impact. As well, we're talking about doing a lot of restructuring and in particular, we've got our laboratory workstations business, one of our other Laboratory Products manufacturing businesses, in the middle of some pretty significant projects to reduce their cost. And this is, obviously, good for the longer term in terms of lowering their cost base. But in the short term, in the quarter, they incurred duplicate operating costs as we consolidated their operation. So we had a number of things that I would considered to be one-offs in the quarter. Looking forward, obviously, we don't provide specific margin guidance by segment, but under most scenarios, I'd expect Laboratory Products and Services margins to be stable in 2012.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to talk about just the academic and government end market for a second. Can you just talk about the trajectory that you saw throughout the fourth quarter and January? And just talk to us a little bit about your comfort with visibility with your assumptions into 2012.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So in terms of the fourth quarter in academic and government, certainly, they improved sequentially from what we experienced in Q3. And we believe that the improvement was really driven by pent-up demand that we saw late in the quarter, particularly in our Lab Consumables business, as well as some of the share gain initiatives that we implemented in Q3. So that's pretty much how it played out in Q4. In terms of January, while we don't have it by every single customer site globally, I would say in aggregate, our January performance is very consistent with the guidance that we outlined for the full year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And secondly, in terms of the Unity Lab Services, obviously, you're pretty excited about the opportunity. So can you talk a little bit about what kind of revenue opportunity that is and what you're seeing in the pharmaceutical outsourcing market?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So when you look at the Unity Lab Services, and this is the focus on the laboratory, it's not the clinical trials outsourcing business, that represents, in order of magnitude, 7% to 8% of our revenue and growing high-single digits type of growth. So very strong growth. And we think with the capabilities we're pulling together, it can actually grow faster than that over time. So that's a good opportunity. The other half of our services is the outsourcing activities and clinical trials, and that's been a strong growth for us for quite a period of time.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Any chance you could put some numbers around that strong growth that you're talking about in outsourcing? Just want to get a better idea of the trend there.", "Marc N. Casper", "High-single digit type growths.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Wood, Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Marc, can you give us some sense of, at least directionally, how to think about the various segments in 2012 vis-a-vis that 3% kind of midpoint consolidated?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, at a high level if you think about the guidance, what I would say is, clearly, academic and government we're assuming to be on the negative equation on growth. And when I look at the other 3 segments, we're looking for strong growth across as we've demonstrated in Biopharma, healthcare, diagnostics and industrial and applied, and that's the basic mix. If you kind of dig into that in a little bit more detail, in Biopharma, we have a very unique value proposition around customer productivity. We have a number of new products, services and very deep relationships with the customers. So we think we're very well positioned to gain share with this customer set. We've demonstrated that over a long period of time. In healthcare and diagnostics, our products are very well attuned to the needs of those customers. Our portfolio is really focused on improving patient care and lowering the cost of care, and we have lots of examples of that. So we think good solid growth here is reasonable with our products really focused on infectious disease diagnostics, monitoring therapeutic drugs for organ transplantation patients, helping pediatricians identify and treat allergies are the kinds of things we do. And then industrial and applied, a lot of our products are used to drive customer productivities, so that positions us well there and we're expecting continued growth. Obviously, that market has done very well for us. So comps get a little bit harder, but I think that gives you a framework for the 4 markets.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "That's great. My last one, my follow-up for Pete, I just want to make sure I'm thinking about the various buckets correctly. If I look at -- in 2012, the incremental Dionex and Phadia accretion, the FX and then the tax benefit, it looks like your guidance assumes somewhere around 6% to 10% kind of core EPS growth. Does that sound correct to you?", "Peter M. Wilver", "I haven't thought about it excluding all those things. But if you think about the growth year-over-year, we're guiding to 12% to 16%, maybe 1/3 of that comes from the acquisition and the balance is the core and the capital deployment. Obviously, the tax rate relates to Phadia and Dionex as well, some of that. It's part of that accretion.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So we should think about some of that tax benefit is included in the net accretion?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Exactly.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe first for Pete. Are you able to break out specifically what the contribution from Phadia and Dionex were in the quarter, what they each did to the top line?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. In terms of the top line, total acquisitions, Phadia and Dionex combined, was about 50 basis points.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then as we think about some of the cost initiatives you've taken, I mean you announced some additional ones back in January. Understanding your operating margin guidance, but how should we think about additional initiatives flowing through versus being reinvested in Asia? And how much of this is you proactively trying to manage your footprint into faster growing markets, i.e., Asia and maybe less indicative of some of the end market headwinds that are out there?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, certainly, on an ongoing basis, we do restructuring efforts. And some of that flows to the bottom line and some of it we do reinvest. So certainly, we've made pretty significant reinvestments in 2011. And at the same time, we were expanding margins. So the plan is to do that in 2012 as well. So we have about, I'd say, 50 basis points of investments that are funded by both our productivity actions, as well as some of those restructuring actions.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "But if we think about those investments, I mean, you're 15% from Asia today, I mean do you have a target of 20% in the next 2 years? Or I mean, how do we think about where you see those reinvestments taking you in Asia?", "Marc N. Casper", "I would say that we continue to increase our Asian percentage. If you go back 5 years ago it was 8%, so we've doubled it. A point-ish a year is a reasonable assumption. It may be a little bit more than that, but somewhere in that range we keep increasing the mix in terms of Asia.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And are there additional investments in R&D that you're making? I mean you were pretty vocal, not too long ago, about stepping up your R&D investment. How do we think about R&D spend on a go-forward basis?", "Marc N. Casper", "So R&D spend, we did a ramp-up back in 2010. And other than the effect of acquisitions, just Phadia and Dionex will increase just as a percent of sales for the company on the full year effect. We're comfortable with the level of R&D. So R&D, excluding acquisitions is pretty flat as a percent of sales.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then last one for Pete, on free cash flow guidance. I mean rough math looks like about 85% of net income. How do you think about the opportunity to maybe improve cash conversion? Some of your peers are well north of 110% or 120%, so how do you think about the opportunity to more effectively convert some of that cash?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, I don't think very many of our peers are 120% of adjusted net, they might be that number on GAAP net income. But certainly, our goal is to get to 90%, that would be about $1.55 billion for the year. So sort of setting the minimum at $1.5 billion. And we're certainly going to drive to get to at least 90% of our adjusted net. And obviously, the lever there is working capital.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai, Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Most of my questions have been answered. But Marc, if you would, could you kind of go over a little bit of how Europe was in the quarter and then what your expectations are in 2012?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. We had a good finish in Europe. We saw strong demand for our analytical instruments and it appeared to us that some of our industrial and some of our pharmaceutical customers in Europe released funds late in the quarter. So it was a nice finish to the year. We're assuming that the conditions in Europe will be on the slower end of growth in terms of a geographic perspective. And obviously, Asia-Pacific, emerging markets being, continuing to have strong momentum next year -- or this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Marc, I just wonder if you could give us some more color around the diagnostic business, the volume trends and utilization you're kind of seeing in Q1 and expectations for 2012?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So in terms of Specialty Diagnostics, we had a good year last year. Our Clinical Diagnostics business, which is our biomarkers, our drugs of abuse testing, our therapeutic drug monitoring products all did very well. Phadia, our immunodiagnostics business, had a very, very good year, both in the period that we owned it and in the period prior to our ownership as well. So 2011, the majority of our business, very strong performance. And as we look at 2012, we're confident that, that's going to be a good growth driver for the company. Utilization is something that we look at. Typically, we don't get hugely affected by utilization because most of our products are used for things that you typically don't defer from a medical perspective. It's typically infectious disease, very children-oriented stuff as well and cancer. So folks that are very sick or parents. So obviously, if you can't afford it, you may not go. But we typically do better than your more routine-type products from areas that we don't play.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And then on the emerging market business, what was your exposure in Q4? And then, the potential negative impact on gross margins in 2012?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of exposure, just to clarify a little bit, Peter?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Just revenue exposure for end of Q4?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So you're saying our percentage of revenue, it was the 15% of our totals. That's for Asia-Pac. We don't really report an emerging market number.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "The number is for the full year or just Q4?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's the full year and...", "Peter M. Wilver", "Might be slightly higher. We don't really measure it as it swings a little bit quarter-to-quarter. We don't really measure it on a quarterly basis.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And the gross margins on that business, what do they look like versus corporate?", "Marc N. Casper", "The margin structure in Asia-Pacific is pretty similar to what we see across the world. It may be slightly lower, but not material.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Derek De Vries of Bank of America.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Couple of questions. I think I might have misheard you. Could you clarify what your implied contribution is from M&A in 2012?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Implied in...", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "In your guidance, in the top line guidance, what's your M&A impact?", "Peter M. Wilver", "In the top line, it's about 50 basis points. So it's the same number, whether it's in or it's out.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I'm just a little bit confused then, so...", "Marc N. Casper", "That's using pro forma...", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "That's using a pro -- okay, okay.", "Marc N. Casper", "All the other acquisitions are contributing about 0.5% of growth.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Right.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got you.", "Marc N. Casper", "Do you got that one?", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Yes. That's fine. That's what I was looking for. And I guess -- so Marc, when you kind of look at your -- and you're talking about a 2% to 4% top line number and with arguably a difficult market, so when you kind of look at the longer-term growth opportunity for the business, do you think the market right now, is it dampening your growth by 1 point? Is it dampening your growth by 2 points? I guess, if we were under a more normalized market conditions, what's the business doing?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, at a very simplistic analysis, if we say that academic and government is down low-single digits type range and historically, over long, long periods of history, it is a low single-digit grower. That's roughly a 6-point swing quarter of our business. So you've got a couple of points -- I'm going to do a very simple math, a couple of points of tougher market conditions than what you've historically had seen pretty much for the last decade. So that's the way to frame it. Everything else, I would say is in the range of normalcy. And I think we're performing well. I think we finished on a strong note. I think I feel reasonable with the guidance from where we sit today. And most importantly, I couldn't be more confident about this company being a mid-single digit growth, not even in the strong markets, but just a little bit less choppy than what we're seeing right now.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And so when you kind of look at where they're -- I realize it's a little early to start thinking about 2013 but obviously, we still have the overhang with [indiscernible] and everything that's out there. It's like what is your working model right now for how you think that old debacle is going to be clarified?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think our assumption is that the conditions we're seeing in academic and government is going to play out the way I articulated it during the course of the full year. And we're not expecting big changes in trajectory one way or another right now in academic and government, just based on the environment we're living in.", "So let me just make a final, couple of closing comments. Obviously, we're pleased to have ended the year on a strong note. We delivered solid growth in revenues and adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter. And again, achieved our earnings growth goals for 2011. I'm confident that our proven strategy for creating shareholder value through top line growth, margin expansion and effective capital deployment positions us to achieve our goals for 2012. I look forward to updating you in April during our Q1 call. And of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "Peter M.

Q4 and Year-End 2000 (sic) [ 2011 ] Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host for today, Ms. Carol Cox, VP, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Carol Cox", "Thank you, Mary. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2011 Earnings Conference Call. A press release was issued today at 1 p.m. Pacific Time or 4 p.m. Eastern Time today and posted on our website at lifetechnologies.com, as well as filed in Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also posted a deck of slides to accompany today's webcast which may be found in the Events and Presentations section of the Life Technologies Investor Relations website with our other earnings materials.", "And joining me on today's call are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Additionally, Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer, will be available during the Q&A portion of the call. If you have not received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com. ", "I want to remind our listeners that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward-looking statements are detailed in filings made by Life Technologies with the SEC. It's our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Thanks, Carol, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today's call. It's fair to say that 2011 was a challenging year for the company as we faced macroeconomic headwinds and constrained spending by some of our customers. At that time, we evaluated what actions we needed to undertake in an uncertain environment and started executing against them. I'm pleased to announce that even in the face of these obstacles, we were able to deliver top line growth and increased our bottom line for the 12th consecutive year since the IPO of Invitrogen.", "For the year, we grew our revenue 4% and took prudent efforts to reduce our costs, helping drive a 40-basis-point increase in operating margins and 5% increase in our non-GAAP earnings per share for the year.", "If we exclude the impact of currency, our operating margins actually expanded an impressive 110 basis points for the year. We continue to expect to grow our operating margins at a rate of about 50 basis points per year and ultimately believe we can achieve operating margins in the mid-30% range.", "Our free cash flow for the year totaled $710 million, a new record high. These results are a testament to the strength of our core businesses, our market expansion strategies and our ability to quickly take actions to reduce operating expenses and optimize our investment spend.", "We finished the year strong, growing our revenue in the fourth quarter 4%, increasing our operating margins 470 basis points and increasing our non-GAAP EPS by 18%. This growth was driven by solid performance in our consumables products, a record number of Ion Torrent PGM shipments, which I'll talk more about later, and continued strength in our BioProduction business even as we faced hard comps from last year's fourth quarter.", "During 2011, we made solid progress expanding our business in emerging markets, where we are developing a local presence to take better advantage of the opportunities. We named a new head of Greater China, which includes mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, to take our operations to the next level. Today, we have nearly 900 employees in this region, and we expect to add another 250 in 2012. We're building a direct sales force across China to ensure broader and deeper penetration of our products and, earlier in the year, brought online much larger warehouse facilities across that country in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to better ensure product availability and faster delivery to our consumers.", "In early 2012, we continued to make progress, announcing an agreement to form a joint venture diagnostics business with China, DaAn company, a leading company in the molecular in-vitro diagnostics to form Life Technologies DaAn Diagnostics. We expect to leverage both companies' clinical sales forces to drive acceptance of a broad menu of CE-based kits and instruments in the Chinese market. This approach leverages our expertise in platform development and DaAn's expertise in regulated markets with kit development and commercialization.", "On the commercial side, we launched our new website in the third quarter, making our customers' purchasing experience much better and allowing us to capitalize on the growing happening in eCommerce. We do over $1 billion a year in eCommerce and have an incredible infrastructure that allows us to move biologically active products to countries all over the world in 3 to 5 days. Think of us as the Amazon.com for life sciences. When researchers are setting up new labs in emerging market countries, they come to Life Technologies because our brands are well established and scientific protocols cross the developed research markets. Using our website, they can easily select and purchase the products they need.", "We continued to build our product portfolio in 2011, introducing 800 new SKUs. I would like to highlight the November launch of our FLoid Cell Imaging Station. FLoid is a good example of how we are listening to our customers and developing products that help them do their work faster, easier and less expensively. FLoid allows researchers to quickly verify cells, creating high-quality images at the benchtop with an efficient and fully integrated solution that does not require specialized training. It's also 1/3 of the cost of conventional fluorescent microscopes and is compatible with our full line of Molecular Probes reagent products.", "Innovation in our genetic solutions business accelerated in 2011. As you know, we offer a full range of genetic solutions in our core product portfolio, from discovery to confirmatory analysis, as well as all the tools needed for downstream molecular biology and cell analysis experiments. Complementing these core offerings is Ion Torrent's game-changing semiconductor technology, which brings simplicity, speed and scalability to genetic sequencing and allows us to play at every stage of discovery and translational research.", "A year ago, we laid out a road map for our Ion Torrent franchise, arguably one of the most groundbreaking cutting-edge technologies we've seen in a long time in life sciences. The road map called for an unprecedented 10x increase in throughput every 6 months. We've reached every technical and commercial milestone we promised in 2011, launching the 314, 316 and 318 chips, and reached an impressive milestone when we shipped well over 700 PGM systems during the year. And if you look at this next-generation sequencing technology, we're really just getting going. ", "A month ago, we announced we're taking orders for our new benchtop Ion Proton Sequencer that is designed to sequence the entire human genome in a day for $1,000. We expect to launch the Ion Proton I Chip in mid-2012, which will allow researchers to sequence exomes in a few hours and the Proton II Chip 6 months later that will sequence human genomes, also in a few hours.", "With the PGM and the Proton, we really have a family of semiconductor sequencing products now. PGM is best-in-class solution for panels of genes and small genomes. It has completely redefined the category, and we think we'll open up vast new horizons in terms of clinical medicine. This platform is expected to drive growth in 2012 and beyond.", "I've talked about our achievements in innovation. Now let me move on to another area where our capabilities are our key strengths. We have a history of performance focus, and I have a great example to share with you. Recently, Industry Week magazine named our Austin, Texas, plant one of its top 10 plants in North America for 2011, making it the very first biotechnology facility to win that prestigious award. Other winners this year include Lockheed Martin and Toyota. I want to congratulate our Austin employees and thank them for their hard work and dedication.", "At the senior level, were recently added 2 new members to our leadership team who will play a critical role in growing our business in the areas of medical sciences and research and development. Ronnie Andrews joined us at the end of January as our new President and Head of Medical Sciences. Ronnie has more than 20 years of experience in the diagnostics industry, including leadership positions at Abbott, Roche and most recently was the CEO of Clarient, which was purchased by GE Healthcare. He is an important addition to our executive team as we grow our Medical Sciences business, particularly as we drive our first line of medicine agenda forward. ", "Ronnie is one of the most dynamic and respected leaders in the diagnostics space and brings deep expertise in commercializing diagnostics, particularly in the molecular domain. He'll apply that expertise to expand our presence in the molecular diagnostics space through partnership strategies, targeted acquisitions and continued innovation around the workflows.", "Dr. Alan Sachs recently joined us as the Head of Global Research and Development. In his new role, he will serve as the key liaison to the external scientific community and play a strong role in our R&D effectiveness and productivity initiatives as we work to increase our return on R&D. Alan's background includes serving on the faculty of University of California, Berkeley, where he was an Associate Professor in the Division of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. He then spent 10 years as a leader at Merck Research Laboratories in the areas of molecular profiling, RNA therapeutics and exploratory and translational sciences.", "Before I move on to our outlook for 2012, I would like to address the topic that is top-of-mind of our investors, capital deployment. We generate a large amount of free cash flow annually, and I want to take a minute to talk about what we have done in the past, our strategy going forward and the criteria we use to evaluate potential acquisitions.", "Our approach over the last few years has been balanced as we have returned over 50% of our cash to equity and debt holders and used the remaining 50% to invest in acquisitions to support key franchises or expand into new markets. In any given year, we may have to pay down more debt or find strategically interesting acquisitions that could skew this ratio. But we are committed to a balanced approach going forward. In fact, since our third quarter earnings release, we have purchased over $100 million worth of our shares under the share repurchase authorization and have another $300 million remaining. We intend to continue to execute on this share repurchase in the near term.", "Turning to our strategy. We have and we will continue to invest in our business through a variety of vehicles, including acquisitions and capital investments, both of which we believe are necessary to drive further growth. We believe in the medium- to long-term growth opportunities in life science and tools industry. And to capitalize on this growth, we expect that acquisitions of various sizes will continue to be a component of our strategy. However, we will take a disciplined approach in evaluating those deals. We understand that investors demand a high rate of return, and we are fully committed to meeting this demand.", "As for the criteria by which we evaluate acquisitions, first, we target attractive markets. Once we have identified an attractive market, then and only then we look at specific companies in that space. As we evaluate these opportunities, we're targeting a greater-than-10% return on invested capital. If a target is a bolt-on or adjacent acquisition, we would expect to get that return within 3 years. If it's a larger platform deal, like our Ion Torrent deal was in 2010, we would target no more than 5 years for that rate of return.", "Now as we move to guidance, I want to mention that we have headwinds and tailwinds from 2011 impacting our top and bottom line growth which are unique to this year, 2012. Because these items require a fair amount of disclosure to ensure that the impact is transparent, David will walk through the specifics in detail in his prepared remarks. In the meantime, I want to talk about how we are expecting our underlying business to grow in 2012.", "First and foremost, we are approaching guidance from a conservative perspective because we think it's the prudent thing to do. We expect that our academic and government customers in developed markets will continue to be cautious, as they were in 2011. In the U.S. and Europe, we're assuming the markets remain challenged but stable. In our emerging and applied markets, such as food and animal safety and molecular diagnostics and in our BioProduction offerings, we're assuming growth opportunities. Finally, we expect our Ion Torrent franchise to grow significantly as we continue to place PGM and Proton instruments and pull through the associated consumables. ", "With all of these components in mind, we are guiding to organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% over 2011 revenues of $3.7 billion and a non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05, implying a growth of 5% at the low end and 9% at the high end of the range over 2011 non-GAAP EPS.", "We are expecting free cash flow in the range of $650 million to $675 million. David will walk you through the details of the onetime cash payments we expect to make in 2012 that impact that free cash flow.", "As we move into 2012, we are confident the markets we compete in will remain stable to what we saw in 2011 or possibly do even better as macroeconomic challenges lessen and a decision on sequestration in the U.S. likely happens later in the year. However, should any of our end markets deteriorate, we are prepared to take action to quickly reduce our costs. ", "Looking beyond 2012, I am very excited about the assets we have at Life. Our strong cash flow and 80% recurring revenues provide stability and support and continued investment in our Ion Torrent platform in emerging and applied markets, both of which will fuel growth into the future.", "With that, I'll turn it over to David to provide a more detailed overview of our results and guidance for 2012.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter and the year, as well as provide greater details on our 2012 guidance.", "We ended 2011 with a solid quarter, growing our revenue and earnings and coming in slightly better than we expected for the year. We expanded our margin, lowered our expenses as a percentage of revenue and leveraged these results to grow our non-GAAP EPS by 5% for the year.", "At a more detailed level, revenue increased 4% to $970 million and increased 3% excluding currency. Organic revenue growth by region in the quarter was as follows: the Americas was flat versus a strong fourth quarter in 2010, Europe grew 4%, Asia Pacific grew 10% and Japan grew 4%. For the full year, the Americas grew 2%, Europe grew 3%, Asia Pacific grew 9% and Japan declined by 3%.", "Taking a closer look at our divisional results for the quarter. The Genetic Systems division increased 13% to $278 million over the same period last year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue increased 11%. For the full year, Genetic Systems grew 8%, and excluding the impact of currency, it grew 7%.", "For both the quarter and the full year, Ion Torrent continued to contribute to the growth in this division, driven by strong sequential sales of the PGM and associated products which were partially offset by reduced sales of SOLiD products. We also continued to see good growth in our forensics business and low single-digit growth in our CE business overall.", "The Molecular Biology Systems division revenue decreased 1% to $441 million for the quarter compared to prior year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue for the division decreased 2%. For the full year, Molecular Biology Systems was flat, and excluding currency, it was down approximately 2%. For both the quarter and the full year, the decline in revenue was due to the expected decrease in qPCR royalty payments and the continued lower spending by government and academic customers. To better understand the underlying results in this division, it might help you to know that the decline in qPCR royalties was a 1% headwind in both periods.", "The Cell Systems division revenue increased 3% to $244 million for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Excluding currency, revenue grew 1%. This performance was the result of tougher comparables for the BioProduction business, which grew approximately 20% in the same period last year.", "For the full year, Cell Systems grew 7%, and excluding currency, it grew 6%, driven by increased BioProduction sales and higher sales across the majority of our other Cell Systems businesses.", "Fourth quarter non-GAAP gross margin increased 20 basis points to 64.8% compared to prior year, driven by higher realized price and higher manufacturing productivity. These benefits were partially offset by the negative impact of higher sales of Ion Torrent instruments, which carry a lower gross margin than the company average. Additionally, we executed on an early termination of a supplier agreement, which had a negative impact on margins in the quarter.", "For the full year, gross margins decreased 150 basis points primarily due to the currency hedges and a higher sales of 5500 upgrades and PGM instruments.", "As expected, on a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by approximately 130 basis points primarily due to product mix that included increased sales of Ion and BioProduction, lower fixed-cost absorption related to year-end inventory management, the termination of the supply agreement and the typical year-end decline in pricing, all of which was partially offset by favorable currency and royalty revenue. Approximately 100 basis points of this decline were onetime or year-end-specific items.", "Fourth quarter non-GAAP operating expenses were $328 million, a decrease of 8% from prior year levels. As a percent of revenue, operating expenses decreased over 440 basis points. Sequentially, operating expenses decreased by $12 million, driven by cost savings initiatives and controls on discretionary spending, which were partially offset by our increased investment in Ion and Greater China.", "In the second half of 2011, we made solid progress in reducing our expenses, delivering a total of $17 million in incremental cost savings compared to Q2, within the range of $10 million to $20 million we guided to in July.", "Full year non-GAAP operating expenses were $1.4 billion, a decrease of 1% over prior year levels. The decrease was due to various cost savings initiatives, partially offset by increased investments in Ion and emerging markets. ", "Our non-GAAP operating profit for the fourth quarter totaled $301 million, an increase of 23% over prior year. Fourth quarter operating margin was a record high 31%, representing an increase of 470 basis points. The increase over the prior year was a result of our continued focus on realizing operational efficiencies throughout the company.  For the full year, operating margins improved 40 basis points to 29.1%. Excluding currency, our operating margins improved 110 basis points.", "In terms of non-GAAP other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $3 million from foreign exchange gains and losses and other items and interest expense of $32 million. Our non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 26.8%. Compared to the same quarter of last year, the rate was up as expected due to recognition in the prior year quarter of the full year effect of the R&D tax credit and other tax provisions which had expired at the end of 2009 and were not renewed until the fourth quarter of 2010. The full year tax rate is 27.3%.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 184.5 million shares, a decrease of 7 million shares year-over-year. Dilution from our employee equity plan was more than offset by our ongoing share repurchase program. For the full year, our diluted share count was 185.6 million. Since our last earnings release, we have purchased approximately 2.5 million shares for $100 million. With this purchase, we will have about $300 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization and as Greg said, we intend to continue to execute against it.", "Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter was $0.69. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $1.06. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exclude noncash interest expense, business integration and other charges and acquisition-related amortization expense.", "In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2011, we settled a licensing dispute which resulted in an increase in GAAP net income. However, since the settlement was associated with prior periods, we've not included this income in our non-GAAP results. For the full year, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share were $3.73.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements, our ending cash and short-term investments were $882 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $636 million. Cash from operating activities was $316 million, capital expenditures were $34 million and free cash flow was $282 million. Free cash flow for the same year came in higher than expected and totaled $710 million, driven by lower restructuring costs and lower capital expenditures. Return on invested capital was 8.9%, and we remain committed to achieving our goal of 10% return on invested capital by the end of 2012.", "Our ending debt as of December 31 was approximately $2.7 billion. This balance is made up of our convertible debt of $450 million and senior notes of $2.3 billion. In January, we announced our intention to redeem the convertible notes on February 15.", "Before I move on to guidance, I have an additional topic to cover. As we announced in our earnings release, we're planning to make changes in our revenue reporting to better align with some recent modifications we've made in our internal organization as well as the end markets we serve. These changes have no impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.", "We currently report revenue under 3 divisions: Molecular Biology Systems, Genetic Systems and Cell Systems. We are reorganizing our business into 3 new business groups: Research Consumables, Genetic Analysis and Applied Sciences. We plan to start reporting revenue under these 3 business groups when we report out on our first quarter of 2012. We understand that everyone will need to update their financial models with the new business groups, and so we will provide revised historical financial data for 2010 and 2011 on our website in April prior to reporting the first quarter results.", "And I'll now move on to our expectations for 2012. We expect organic revenue growth to range between 2% and 4% for the year. The middle of this range is in line with the growth we had in our business at the end of the year and in the second half of 2011. Our revenue growth is again expected to be weighted to the back half of the year with revenue growth in the first half of the year expected to be slightly below the lower end of the guidance range.", "Growth for the year includes overcoming approximately $130 million in headwinds made up of the following components: we're estimating a $30 million reduction in qPCR royalties, a $40 million reduction in U.S. stimulus-related sales as those grants end and a $60 million reduction of sales of 5500 instruments as we continue to ramp up sales of Ion Torrent semiconductor sequencing products.", "On the other hand, we no longer have the currency hedge, which was a $64 million drag on revenue in 2011, although currency at December month-end rates is more than offsetting the positive benefit on revenue. The net impact to revenue of the hedge roll-off and the changes in the exchange rate is a negative $26 million or 0.7%, but is actually a positive $0.02 impact to our non-GAAP EPS.", "Operating margin is expected to improve approximately 50 to 100 basis points compared to 2011. We continue to be on track to achieve 31% operating margin by the end of 2013.", "We expect non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05 with an implied increase of 5% to 9% over 2011 results.", "We plan to update our currency expectations quarterly based on month-end rates at the end of each quarter. While we cannot predict how rates will move throughout 2012, if all currencies moved against the dollar by 5% and our mix of foreign currencies stay the same, the impact on earnings per share would be about $0.24.", "We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $650 million to $675 million. The decline from 2011 is the result of approximately $130 million in onetime cash costs we will have in 2012 that we did not have in 2011, primarily related to a tax recapture payment due on the convertible notes, a payment associated with the Ion Torrent milestone -- excuse me, and the increased capital expenditures, which are expected to be in the range of $120 million to $140 million in 2012.", "Our free cash flow forecast also includes approximately $40 million of onetime expenses related to restructuring, down from approximately $80 million in 2011. ", "I want to take a minute now to provide some additional details related to the guidance that I believe will help you update your financial models for 2012.", "First, we expect our revenue and earnings to be weighted to the second half of the year, with the split between the first half and the second half of 2012 being very similar to the first half-second half split we had in 2011. We expect our results for the first quarter to be the lowest of the year, results in the fourth quarter to be the highest and for our results in the second and third quarters to be generally in line with each other.", "Second, while we do not normally provide quarterly guidance, nor do we plan to provide it moving forward, we do believe that giving greater detail than normal around the first 2 quarters would be helpful. Our expectation is that for the first quarter, revenue will be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, and non-GAAP EPS will be $0.91 to $0.95.", "For the second quarter, we're expecting revenue to be slightly down compared to the second quarter of 2011, which benefited from over $30 million in SOLiD instrument sales, and for EPS to be up slightly from the range we are guiding to for the first quarter of 2012.", "We're estimating our non-GAAP tax rate to be approximately 28%. Our guidance assumes that the R&D tax credit will be reinstated and that the impact of this benefit is approximately 0.6%. The overall tax rate is about 0.5% higher than 2011 due to lower anticipated sales of instruments manufactured overseas.", "We expect the first quarter tax rate will be about 28.6%. Our rate in the second and third quarters will also likely be 28.6%. We do not expect that the R&D tax credit will be extended prior to the fourth quarter.", "Full year interest expense, net of interest income, is expected to be approximately $120 million. Other income and expense, which includes foreign exchange gains and losses, is expected to total approximately $10 million in expense. Assuming an average share price of $49, we would expect the weighted average diluted share count for the year to be in the range of 184 million to 186 million shares. And this does not include the impact of any additional share repurchases which we may do during the rest of the year.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Carol.", "Carol Cox", "Great. Thanks, David. Mary, we'll open the call now to question and answers. I would just ask everyone, if you could limit your questions to 1 question and 1 follow-up, we will greatly appreciate it so we can get as many calls in as possible. Mary, if you could open it up, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Greg, so with respect to -- you've given a lot of color on some of the headwinds you've got, but you talked about some of the offsets being the traction you're seeing in Ion Torrent. Can you maybe give us a little color on how you ended the year in Q4 with Ion Torrent sales? And then kind of what you expect the contribution to be in 2012?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, in terms of Ion Torrent in the fourth quarter, we had substantial sequential growth over the third quarter. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we had well over 700 PGM systems sold over the course of 2011. So it was a real gangbuster year for Ion Torrent. We expect, as I also said in the prepared comments, substantial growth over that level again in 2012. And that will be made up of more PGM instruments, which just continues to gain traction because it's proven, it's low cost, easy to use, and then increasingly in the second half of the year, the Proton instrument.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then as you're -- you've announced Proton. But what's the customer response been? I mean, do you see that customers that liked PGM continue to buy PGM? Or do you think that some of the customers that will maybe look at PGM might have -- might hold back and wait until the Proton gets released?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, we are not seeing cannibalization of the Proton on to the PGM. PGM is for genes and panels and small genomes. Proton is for exomes and genomes. And I would be -- want to point out very importantly that we've created a bridge strategy that rewards customer loyalty. And so you can buy a PGM, and essentially it goes towards full credit if you also then want to secure a Proton. So there is no penalty, if you will, of having to make a choice between PGM or Proton. It's really about what application do you need, and we have a semiconductor sequencing instrument to solve it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I just had my question and a follow-up. My first question is maybe a little bit more detail on PCR. I know you gave the detail on the royalties, but if you just think about kind of the base kind of instrument business versus the assay and more consumable business on -- in your PCR franchise, all included. Maybe you can just give us a little bit of detail as to how that was trending in '11 and what you anticipate that doing in 2012.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. And I will jointly answer this question with Mark, who's on the phone. But the first is an overlay that -- we've had to overcome pretty substantial PCR royalties expiring over the last few years. In 2012, as David mentioned, it's really the last big year of the drop-off. And so what we face in 2013 is very manageable, much smaller. And so I think that removes a substantial headwind as we move through 2012. Now in terms of the underlying instruments versus assays, Mark, maybe you could answer Jon his question.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, Jon. I would say that we continue to see good strength in our assays business and the consumables pulling through just a large install base. And as we go into this year, we will see a refreshment to the higher end of our qPCRs. We launched the QuantStudio and start shipments in this first quarter. So we're optimistic about that getting traction in the high throughput range.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And then just kind of a follow-up on the -- on some of the things you've laid out for the year as well. You mentioned SOLiD being -- the revenues on the instruments side, and obviously you're going to lose those. What are you seeing so far on the reagent side? I mean, should we be thinking about SOLiD revenues basically being really 0 in 2012 as people shift to the Ion platforms? Or I guess how should we think about the consumable flow on top of the existing instruments?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, it's a good question. First, we're expecting SOLiD consumables to be in the tens of millions for 2012. And importantly, we're very focused on having those customers that own the 5500 to get ever more productivity. And one of the things that we are introducing to them is an upgrade program called Wildfire that eliminates EPCR completely and makes the 5500 instrument incredibly easy to use. And therefore, hopefully, more experiments get conducted on that installed base.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe just following up on the last one on SOLiD. I mean, as we think about the Proton system and the Ion Torrent road map, can you just talk a little bit about will you be going after SOLiD customers, trying to get them to swap out? And also, how we think about CE. Are there incentives in place to try to get some of them to convert over to either PGM or the Proton system when that's out later this year?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. Mark, why don't you grab that one?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, sure. So we take on the 5500 customers, we certainly will see those customers and we'll target them, not only continue with 5500 but introduce Ion and Proton to them. And the rapid turnaround, I think, will be attractive to them. And as we get to the whole genome, that will be important. We see -- we really still see a set group of applications that -- particularly in the validated area, we continue to see in diagnostics. So that will remain stable. But certainly, some of our CE customers we'll also introduce Ion Torrent to, and there'll be additional users that we'll target as part of our loyalty program to upgrade CE as well to Ion Torrent.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then this one -- next one may be a little bit of a moot point now that you're restructuring the divisions. But as we think about the underlying growth for your businesses, should we think about Molecular Biology getting back to a -- kind of call it a low- to mid-single-digit growth profile if you back out the PCR royalty roll-off?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Tycho, that's clearly our expectation is to get in 2012 to probably this year, low single digits and then building off that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Amit Bhalla from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to just get your thoughts on the other 2 business segments and the outlook. You just said Molecular Biology, low-single digits. So can you talk about Cell Systems and Genetic Systems outlook for 2012 and just overlay what your view is on academic and government spending in the various parts of your guidance range?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So I'll take that one. Cell Systems grew this year in the mid-single digits. It was less impacted by the slowdown in government spending than some of the other divisions. We expect it'll continue to grow in about the mid-single digits next year. Genetic Systems overall grew in the teens powered by the Ion Torrent, and we expect it to continue to grow in about that range next year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And my second question, a follow-up, is on the acquisition strategy. I think, Greg, you mentioned acquisitions of various sizes. That was the words you used in your prepared comments. Can you go into a little bit more detail on timing and how you think about -- and what are the criteria for the different sizes?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. I think it would be a mistake to say that we're targeting any particular size because we don't. We're really incredibly focused on return on invested capital when we deploy the money towards an acquisition. And quite frankly, you haven't seen us do a lot over the last 18 months because we feel that we would not be able to get good return on that money. We've done smaller, little tuck-in things that, quite frankly, we've barely even announced because they're not that significant. So I would just convey back to you is that size doesn't matter to us, but really deployment of capital and getting a return on it is really what guides us today.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Deutsche Bank.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "Greg, you talked about sort of the sequestration here in the U.S. where we'll get an outcome at some point this year. And obviously, we've seen some different budgetary changes x U.S. I mean, how are you guys thinking about the way customers are going to respond to these sort of in-flux budgets as the year goes on vis-\u00e0-vis sort of -- compare it to what we saw in 3Q? And how are you sort of prepared for that from an instrument base versus a consumable base? And do you expect sort of the reactions to be different in either of those 2 subgroups?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, let me give you some thoughts on your broad-ranging question here. First, as I've said publicly, we believe that sequestration will not happen and that the NIH budget will be relatively secure, flat, up a little in 2013. That's our opinion, and we'll see what happens towards the end of the year. We think, no matter what, though, that these customers in academic and government entities around the world will remain focused on getting ever better deals. It's just a new realm of affordability that I think guides their choices. And to that end, we believe that we have a very compelling, winning strategy to grow nicely in that environment. It's a little bit, as I've said also publicly, the BMW strategy. We're the only brand or set of brands that can scale from the very high end to the lower-standard end with, I think, a secure source and great quality. So we're going to do well, and we're very focused on doing well on that environment. Lastly, I think it's irrefutable that as grants are made here or in Europe or in China, there's ever more money focused on genetic analysis. And I think you can see by our fourth quarter results that we are building a very strong, broad product line and set of solutions there that range from Ion to qPCR and this new QuantStudio that does digital PCR to the broadest range of assays that you can order online. And that's the message going out, and we're seeing real traction as being the place and the provider that people want to partner with.", "Ross Muken - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division", "That was great. Maybe just one quick follow-up to a question that was asked before. So you added some pretty serious management talent to the business in the last couple of months. Obviously some pretty diverse experience but certainly giving some sort of medical and sort of nontraditional for you sort of a backbone with a few of the folks. I mean, as you look at the business longer term in terms of moving towards the clinic, obviously it's going to be a mix of an organic and inorganic strategy, and some of the inorganic might skew this. But how much of your business do you think you can eventually have that's sort of outside sort of the traditional research markets, whether it's clinical, clinical and applied, et cetera? Is there sort of a stated long-term goal? Do you think that clinical could be as big as the applied markets are for you today? What kind of color can you give us there on a long-term basis?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "It's a good question. At the board level, we talk about this a lot and we're committed over the next several years to get about 30% of our portfolio out of life science research directly, whether that's in forensics, food testing or, as you described, in the medical realm. In the medical realm, we're being pulled in that direction, in following the Ion Torrent technology, because it's really creating a compelling solution set now for hospitals, diagnostic companies and the like. And I think the beauty of where we stand today is that we will partner and we will out-license that technology to partners that can really make the most of it. And we did that strategy with great success with qPCR in the research realm, and we'll do that strategy with great success in the clinical realm with Ion Torrent. And so I think we tell people we have an open door. We're ready for open dialogue, and we're seeing lots of people wanting to come and knock on that door and do business with us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Bill Bonello from RBC Capital.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I have a question on the change in the business units. If you can just tell us a little bit more about the thinking behind that. Does it imply any kind of a change in the way that you're evaluating the markets? Any kind of a change in how you're approaching the markets? And any kind of change in the leadership of the business units? And then I do have a follow-up.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, let me take that the one and then Mark can jump in. These are business groups that we think better match how the business has evolved internally, and I think it also is a better match with our markets. And one way that that's a better match is in the Applied Sciences, which Greg spoke about. We're going to more clearly group the businesses, forensics, BioProduction, those businesses that are not research focused, so that investors can see the results better tied to the end use markets. The other change that we're making is in Genetic Analysis where we're grouping all of the instruments in the applied consume -- and the associated consumables into that. And so I think the internal organization has evolved to those kind of groupings and that this just better matches up the way we're looking at the business internally and from a market perspective with the way we're talking about it to investors.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So just -- that was sort of, I think, that I might follow up. So actually, in terms of sort of how you're structured from a management and reporting and organizational standpoint, that really is not changing? It's really just how you're reporting the results to all of us that's changing?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, there's been some changes that have taken place in -- over the course of the last couple of years, and we've just not reflected that in our external reporting. I think what we're doing now is catching up the external reporting with really the evolution that's taken place with the internal structure.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So Greg, appreciate the color on the return criteria. Can you comment at this point on how you're tracking kind of towards that 10% hurdle rate by year 5 on Ion Torrent? Are you ahead, in line or behind where you thought it should be at this point? And then will you be open to disclosing kind of empirical figures around this whenever the appropriate time may be, from your perspective?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Just so I understand that last part, the empirical figures for the overall calculation or Ion Torrent results?", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "No, for Ion Torrents. So just whenever that -- the appropriate time may be, whether it's in year 3, year 4, are you open to disclosing more detail around how you're tracking to that metric?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Sure. So on the first part, the first year of Ion Torrent exceeded our expectations. And we're on -- we're in -- a month or so into 2012 and we're on track again for the second year of our expectations. The second half of your question is would we divulge how big did Ion Torrent sequencing become 3, 4 years down the road, and I think the answer is yes. But -- and I'd also say to you that when it gets to that, you will also see, because it will be powering the top line of the company significantly. So we'll be happy to talk about that in a couple of years' time.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, very good. My follow-up is for David. Are you willing to comment on gross margins in 2012? And I'm particularly interested in how you're kind of viewing mix as an overall effect. I know there was a lot of noise related to SOLiD upgrades in '11, Ion Torrent growth in '12. So anything you can offer us on kind of gross margin mix effect in '12 would be great.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes. So let me comment a little. I'd -- first, I'd start off by saying we really want to focus people on the operating margin. We've said that's going to be up to 50 to 100 basis points, and we'll do what we need to do, as Greg said, in order to ensure that we get there. In terms of gross margin, you're right, there are a lot of moving parts there. We think the gross margin's been up slightly in 2012. We do have some headwinds there, principally the fall in royalties and also the increased growth in Ion Torrent, both of which are a drag on our gross margins. But we have productivity programs and other things underway that we think will offset that.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "All right, that was great. One last one. R&D as a percent of sales.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "R&D as a percent of sales will be a little bit over 9%. And as we've said publicly, we're good at that level. I think investors should see somewhere between high 8s, 10% is a range that we can flex in. And so we're hovering around 9% in 2012.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I have a technology geek question. So given that...", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Dave will answer that.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So given -- I mean, just a kind of question on the benchtop sequencing market. So given that your competitor's box that can do 4 to 7 gigabases per run, admittedly for much longer run time, and your Proton 1 Chip is basically going to be doing about 10 megs, albeit in a shorter time. Really, given the path -- technological pathway -- I mean, I would argue that as in the run time, cost per boxes are roughly basically equivalent. So to me, the big question when I look at this is what does the Proton II Chip really do? And I guess, how soon are we going to be able to see results from that? Are we going to see something in AGBT?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So let me answer that first, then Mark can fill in any gaps. But in AGBT next week, we will be showing some data that I think will provide more clarity of just how compelling this instrument is. I think there's a few other points just to amplify, though. First, you shouldn't dismiss the speed aspect. We're talking about substantial differences in speed, between well over a day, maybe 2 days, versus hours. And I can assure you as we speak with customers, especially in a clinical setting, that makes all the world of difference, and you don't have to have much of a discussion after that. However, there are substantial other advantages. For example, the read length. The read length of this instrument continues to increase, and that allows us to have ever more set of applications that I think open up an lot of new horizons. I'll give you an example. HLA. And so we're working with customers in HLA now that this instrument could be a compelling new platform for that field. The last thing I would say to you, again I think you shouldn't just compare the Proton instrument directly to that other instrument, because with the change of a simple chip, which is a consumable, you go from an exome to entire genome in 2012. And so there is a lot of versatility, a lot of growth. And again, just the economics, bottom line, are far better on this Proton instrument. That's not just me talking. That's what the customers are saying. And we'll have to prove that out in our results, and we'll -- we intend to do that.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. Speaking of the PGM, what are you looking at -- what was the average consumable pull-through kind of exiting 2011? And what are you looking for, for 2012?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Derik, the average consumable pull-through for the PGM for the year at the end of the year was about $50,000, and we're targeting around $60,000 for next year. And we still believe we're on track for the $80,000 that we originally projected.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And just one quick, if I could squeeze it in. You're talking about seeing Molecular Biology Systems go back to a low-single-digit growth rate. Obviously, that's going to be a very back-end loaded for this just given what your implied guidance and the fact that your PCR royalties are going to have to come off a lot in Q1 and Q2, if I remember correctly on how this works.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay, just making sure I can do the math.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Appreciate all your comments earlier in your prepared remarks on capital deployment. Clearly, there's a lot of focus in the investment community on the Roche tender for Illumina. Clearly, expanding into the clinical environment is an ongoing focus for Life Technologies. Does a major diagnostic company becoming so aggressive in its pursuit of a next-gen sequencing platform at all affect how you think about how quickly and how much you should be spending on advancing into the clinic? And how important could M&A be in accelerating your initiatives in this area?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Look, I would say that the Roche-Illumina transaction really doesn't affect our plans. We're not anxious. We're deliberate and we're executing a road map that Ronnie Andrews is going to do a masterful job doing. And one of the things that we'll do, and just to be very clear since I maybe wasn't clear in the earlier question-and-answer was, we are able to partner with other diagnostic companies in a very compelling way, and Ronnie will lead that effort. There are other areas and new ideas we have of business models that we're also carrying out, and Ronnie will lead that, too. And so I would just tell you that we're executing on a plan. A person of the caliber of Ronnie Andrews would not have joined us unless he came in, saw what [ph] the plans shared with him, and he felt they were really a winning set of ideas. So, you'll see them unfold. You'll start to see them unfold. And we feel good about our hand.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe if I could just ask 2 quick clean-up questions. I think you said there was $300 million remaining in the repurchase program. Is that exclusive of the amount that you set aside to buy back shares related to the Ion Torrent milestone?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then could you guys give out anything that will allow us to get at a placement number for PGM in Q4? I'm just curious if you continued the sequential growth that we've seen over the last few quarters, the first full quarter you're competing with Misic [ph]?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Substantial growth in the fourth quarter over the third quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just wanted to try another question on the Ion Torrent piece from a different angle. If we look back the last couple of quarters, you've broken out acquisition contributions that would imply that the business there for PGM is growing, a pretty nice clip, I think about 45% sequential. So just trying to get a sense of how that trend continued in the fourth quarter. Obviously, the product has a lot of momentum. But just trying to square up what the contribution of PGM was this quarter. And then as we look into this coming year, what kind of trajectory is implied? When you kind of think of the midpoint of your guidance is 3% organic, how much of that is Ion Torrent?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, what we've done this time, Isaac, and I appreciate the questions that people are asking, is that since we've now lapped one year, we're not breaking out Ion Torrent for competitive reasons in the detail that we've done in the past. We provided the number of units. As Greg said, we had been growing sequentially at a rate of about 50% or so, and that continued in the fourth quarter.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's fair. And just if we look more broadly on the economic spending environment, maybe if you could kind of look back on the quarter and give us a sense qualitatively of what we've learned about how customer purchasing behavior may be taking place relative to your initial expectations. Has there been any sort of trend in the behavior line with the uncertain funding environment that you've found notable or maybe different than you initially expected?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Look, I think we said that it didn't get better, it didn't get the worse. It's really has stabilized. But this is a difficult environment. You've got to be really committed to do well in this environment. And given that this is the bulk of what we do, we've gotten pretty damn good at what we do in this market. And you saw that by the leverage and the results we got in the fourth quarter. I think going forward, this will -- this environment continues, and as you heard our guidance, we expect it to continue and not get worse but not get better. There will be companies that probably can't continue to invest at the rate they need to, to remain relevant. And we feel great about that as potentially a consequence because we're very committed to being there at the bench for biologically active products all over the world. And I think we're going to come through this period pretty strong.", "Carol Cox", "All right, great. Well thank you, everyone. This concludes our fourth quarter 2011 conference call. And obviously, if you will have any additional questions, please feel free to contact us here at the offices. The webcast will be available via replay on our website for about 3 weeks.

I would like to remind our listeners today that our discussion will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company.", "We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Lucier.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Thanks, Carol, and thank you, everyone, for joining us on today's call. We are very pleased to open the year with stronger-than-expected first quarter results. Solid performance across all our businesses, especially in Genetic Analysis, which [ph] have revenues of $939 million, a 5% increase over last year. Excluding currency, we are able to grow revenue 2%, which is in-line with our annual guidance range of 2% to 4% organic growth and slightly ahead of where we were expected to be in the first quarter.", "We increased gross margins to 66.6% and reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to drive operating margin expansion of over 200 basis points, all of which we leveraged to grow non-GAAP earnings per share 17% to $0.99.", "Our end markets remained in-line with our expectations, with strength in emerging markets and in Asia, and stability in the U.S. and Europe. We saw particular strength across all our businesses in Japan as the government fiscal year ended and researchers spent their remaining budget funds. We expect to see the normal sequential decline in Q2 as the Japanese government finalizes its budget for 2012 in May and researchers evaluate their spending.", "Emerging markets continue to offer incredible growth opportunities. We had high-teens growth in Greater China during the quarter and saw double-digit growth in our Latin American business, as well as strong growth in Eastern Europe and Russia, where we are expanding our sales network. We are primarily a direct seller of our goods, although in new markets, we have often entered with the help of local distributors.", "As these markets have grown, we have begun acquiring some of these distributors and that strategy is really starting to pay off.", "In early March, I had the opportunity to spend a week in India, visiting employees at our training facility in Delhi and our customer service organization in Bangalore. During my trip, we hosted 2 events with customers where we highlighted Proton and the applications of next-generation sequencing. So far, 2 well-known genomic laboratories in India have placed orders for the Ion Proton, citing the simplicity and higher throughputs of the technology as well as Life Technologies' strong presence in the country.", "Our meetings included a range of government officials, academic opinion leaders, diagnostic customers in public and private hospitals and biotech startups. We are excited about our opportunities in India and are continuing to invest in our infrastructure, partner locally and expand our employee base there to drive fundamental demand for our instrumentation and consumables. These investments are helping drive double-digit revenue growth in 2012.", "During the quarter, we made solid progress in our Applied Sciences business. We completed 2 tuck-in acquisitions and both of which were on our Animal Health and Food Safety business, where we acquired assets to help differentiate us in the market and further accelerate our double-digit expansion. Matrix MicroScience is a U.K.-based manufacturer of large, sample-volume, automated prep systems and consumables for food-borne pathogen detection. With the addition of these products, Life now offers the fastest and most cost-effective workflow to our customers.", "LSI is a leader in veterinary realtime PCR animal testing, and combined now with Life, we offer a full suite of solutions for both ELISA and PCR-based animal health tests. On our last earnings call, I mentioned that Ronnie Andrews had joined Life as our President of Medical Sciences. Ronnie has hit the ground running and he and his team are developing a comprehensive strategy to expand our presence in the molecular diagnostics space and to capitalize on our existing platforms and tools for use in clinical settings.", "Over the next several years, we will be working to take advantage of the broad portfolio of technologies Life has in its arsenal to translate research discoveries into valuable genetic information. Today, we arguably have one of the top instrument reagent portfolios in the world, with over 7,500 placements of instrument platforms in clinical settings that enable hospitals and labs to develop and use assays. These placements span our CE, qPCR, SOLiD and PGM technologies. Combining these with newly introduced technologies and fluorescent microscopy and flow cytometry allows us a unique opportunity to be more than a single-discipline product supplier to the clinical market and enables us to become a solutions provider to clinicians, who are solving some of medicine's most complex problems.", "Simplifying the vast amount of information resulting from the diagnostic process around complex diseases will require new innovative informatics solutions. We are participating in this area, which we believe will ensure our relevance in the physician-patient interaction. We are focusing on our existing 7,500 placements that are running content in the clinic today and determining how we can extract value from this installed base. We're working with pharmaceutical companies to develop companion diagnostic panels to aid in decision making around these exciting new treatments. With over 500 new targeted therapeutics in the oncology space alone, we know there are complex decisions to be made and that molecular diagnostics solutions, covering both the proteome and the genome, will need to be involved. Our technology breadth positions us well to support assay development and information synthesis in 5 key areas where we believe we can create value: oncology, inherited disease, transplant diagnostics, infectious diseases and neurological disorders. Each opportunity has a unique go-to-market strategy and timing of entry, but you should expect us to be active in all of them over time and we look forward to updating you as the strategy unfolds.", "In addition to finding ways to expand our market opportunities, we're also finding better ways to improve our customer experience, increase productivity and lower our costs. Our efforts in this area include continuing to improve our processes around manufacturing, IT and other operational areas. This disciplined staged approach to running the business enables us to continue to expand our operating margins to some of the highest in the business, if not the entire S&P 500.", "On the commercial side, we continue to capitalize in making our customers' purchasing experience much easier. In the first quarter, we continued to grow sales origining from our website and substantially increased the number of global supply centers coming online. We have found that customers who order through our website and also have a supply center at their lab grow faster than our average customer, and so we are increasing our focus on encouraging more and more customers to adopt this profile.", "On the operational side, we continue to prove our ability to manufacture and deliver biologically active products all over the world in 3 to 5 days. Our teams have developed standardized processes that enable our facilities to successfully meet the demand of thousands of orders daily at an impressive fill rate of over 98%. The ability to be a trusted source to get biologically active products anywhere in the world quickly and reliably is part of the equation to further our market share growth.", "We are currently kicking off plans to expand our global manufacturing network for Gibco Media, which is part of our BioProduction business. This year is the 50th anniversary of our Gibco brand serving the biopharmaceutical industry and we are excited to, again, be increasing our presence in this market.", "We're making a significant investment in our U.K. operation with support from the Scottish Government to build a state-of-the-art facility for our market-leading proprietary Advanced Granulated Technology or AGT media. This new facility will support our expanding cell culture media markets in Europe and Asia, and provide our pharmaceutical customers and CMO partners with multiple sourcing options for media delivery.", "During the quarter, we expanded our leader offerings across our PCR and qPCR businesses. We began taking orders for our QuantStudio digital PCR product and immediately saw higher customer demand than expected. QuantStudio is a versatile instrument used for high throughput, realtime and digital PCR. It is ideal for customers who require speed, flexibility and scalability as they conduct high-quality qPCR analysis, run high volumes of samples for pharmacogenetic studies or AgBio applications like crop testing.", "Our TaqMan product has over 10,000 scientific citations to date, more than virtually any other brand in our industry. During the quarter, we expanded our TaqMan Mutation Detection Assays with the introduction of new assays that will be relevant for cancer researchers. These highly sensitive and novel molecular analysis research tools are designed to detect an additional 241 of the most common mutations in 21 cancer genes and to provide researchers with tools to accurately and quickly interrogate their samples for a broader range of key cancer mutations. This technology serves as an ideal complement to accurately confirm results of next-generation sequencing experiments. ", "Turning to Ion Torrent. We continued to make compelling progress across this game-changing platform during the quarter. In early January, we announced the 2012 roadmap for the Proton I Chip and Proton II Chip, presented human exome data and some preliminary human genome data for a mother, father and child at the AGBT Conference in February and launched our AmpliSeq Custom Panels in March. We continued to see strong demand for the PGM instrument and our associated consumables, driving results for the quarter that were in-line with our expectations. We saw significant year-over-year growth in the PGM platform as we continue to enjoy strong competitive positioning. We are winning the majority of bids where we compete, and just as importantly, we are expanding the existing PGM market by reaching customers who are new to next-generation sequencing. During the quarter, we expanded our leadership in the benchtop instrument category and continue to have the largest installed base for next-generation sequencers on the market. In fact, we add over 100 new members to our Ion community each and every week.", "We continue to be on track for midyear delivery of the Proton I Chip and 6 months later, for the Proton II Chip. We have seen a great deal of interest from new and existing customers and have been taking orders for the product, including a number of orders for multiple Proton units. We recently installed early access units to Baylor and they were already generating raw data needed for full exome in just a few hours. We expect they will continue to create data and we will be publishing data sets. Between now and the full commercial launch by the end of Q3, we also expect to publish internal data. ", "In addition to Proton, we continue to innovate across our next-generation sequencing offerings on the PGM. In March, we expanded our AmpliSeq offerings with the launch of Ion AmpliSeq Custom Panels and the availability of the Ion AmpliSeq Designer. These Custom Panels are one of the most important breakthroughs since qPCR, unlocking archive research samples containing low amounts of DNA. Previously, this type of research was performed less effectively with array technology. AmpliSeq is able to highly multiplex targets rapidly and accurately using incredible amounts -- low amounts of DNA, which makes it an excellent research tool. We fully expect these panels to transform disease research. Researchers are also able to use our Ion AmpliSeq Designer to create their own Custom Panels easily through our website. These panels can be designed in as little as 2.5 hours using Ion Torrent's intuitive data analysis methods. These researchers, then, are able to rapidly scale it from analyzing just a few genes to hundreds of genes all in a single day. Again, we think this will be transformational.", "I have a couple of updates related to compensation and capital deployment. In February, our Board of Directors took steps to increase the alignment of management compensation with the interest of our shareholders. Beginning in 2012, management's long-term incentive compensation will be delivered through a combination of 50% RSUs, 25% stock options and 25% in a cash-based performance plan, which is tied to the achievement of specific ROIC and revenue growth targets over a 3-year period. This is the first long-term incentive plan at Life that includes ROIC targets and we think it's an important step in the maturation of the company. We also continued to repurchase shares during the quarter, spending $185 million in the last 3 months. We have another $200 million remaining under our current share repurchase program. As we have met with investors over the last several months, the topic of dividends has come up often. We have shared these conversations with our board and with the broader management team. As we have said in the past, we are committed to returning a balanced portion of cash to our shareholders and we continue to review all options on how best to do so. We've gotten off to a good start -- a strong start with our first quarter results and are encouraged by the market dynamics we are seeing so far. We continue to believe that these markets in which we compete will remain relatively stable through 2012. We believe it's prudent to maintain a cautious but optimistic outlook for the remainder of the year, given that macroeconomic challenges do remain and decisions related to sequestration in the U.S. will likely happen later in the year. We are maintaining our outlook for organic revenue growth of 2% to 4% over 2011, of revenues of $3.7 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4.05. We are monitoring our end markets and developments in Washington on an ongoing basis and should we see any deterioration in the current trend, we're prepared to take action quickly to preserve profitability. But here, in the first quarter, we feel good about the performance of the business. The company is healthy and competitive, and we're excited about the innovations coming out of our labs in the coming quarters. With that, I will turn the call over to David to provide a more detailed overview of our results and our guidance for 2012.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. As Greg noted, we had a solid start to the year, delivering revenue and earnings growth that exceeded our internal expectations. We increased sales across all of our business groups and improved efficiencies, which drove operating margin expansion and EPS growth of 17% for the quarter. At a more detailed level, revenue increased 5% to $393 million and increased 2%, excluding currency. As Greg mentioned earlier, revenue growth by region in the quarter was basically in-line with our expectations, with stable conditions in the U.S. and Europe and higher growth in the emerging markets.", "Growth was as follows: The Americas were flat; Europe grew 2%; Asia Pacific grew 8%; and Japan grew 7%.", "Beginning this quarter, we're reporting our revenue for our new business groups: Research Consumables, Genetic Analysis and Applied Sciences, which better reflect our internal organization, product mix and end markets. As you recall, our internal organization had previously been structured around our technology platforms under 3 divisions: Molecular Biology Systems, Genetic Systems and Cell Systems. On April 11, we filed a Form-8K with historical financial information for these 3 new business groups for the years 2010 and 2011. The filing and a set of FAQs can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website.", "Before we move on to the revenue results for the first quarter, I want to address a couple of housekeeping items about revenue disclosures for today's call and moving forward. We will not be providing additional revenue breakouts below the 3 new business groups, although you can expect that we will provide color on the businesses as necessary. Additionally, we are making modifications to the information we are publicly disclosing for our Ion Torrent platform. 2011 was the first full year that Ion Torrent revenues were included in our results, and so they were reported separately through the third quarter of 2011. For this quarter and moving forward, we will no longer break out Ion Torrent revenues, which are reported under the Genetic Analysis business group.", "We are reducing the amount of the information disclosed for competitive reasons. We understand that investors are interested in how the Ion Torrent platform is doing and we intend to continue to provide general commentary on the business results, including trends in our instrument and consumables sales. We may also from time-to-time provide updates on the achievement of certain milestones and other color on the business as part of our overall discussion of the Genetic Analysis group.", "Taking a closer look at our business group results for the quarter. Research Consumables revenue increased 4% to $420 million over the same period last year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue increased 1%. We continue to see growth in our cell culture products, endpoint PCR and molecular and cell biology consumables. Revenue for Genetic Analysis increased 7% to $356 million for the first quarter compared to prior year. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue for Genetic Analysis increased 4%. This increase was primarily due to growth of Ion Torrent and CE products, offset by the decrease in qPCR royalty revenues and lower sales of SOLiD products, both of which were expected and included in our guidance.", "Applied Sciences revenue increased 4% to $162 million for the first quarter compared to prior year. Excluding currency, revenue grew 3%. The increase was driven by the BioProduction, Forensics and Animal Health and Food Safety businesses. The BioProduction business grew in the mid-single digits over tough comparables. In the first quarter of last year, it grew 20%.", "First quarter gross margin increased 30 basis points to 66.6% compared to prior year, driven by the tailwind from the roll-off of the hedges, higher realized price and the increased productivity. These benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher sales of Ion Torrent instruments and the decline in qPCR royalties.", "As expected on a sequential basis, gross margin increased by approximately 220 basis points, primarily due to higher fixed cost absorption related to increases in production volume relative to Q4; product mix, driven by lower sales of SOLiD instruments; and higher realized price, partially offset by the decline in qPCR royalty.", "First quarter operating expenses were essentially flat year-over-year at $342 million. As a percent of revenue, operating expenses decreased over 170 basis points. Sequentially, our operating expenses were up as we invested in growth initiatives in Greater China and the Ion Torrent platform, as well as in various sales and marketing activities, including our annual regional sales meetings which take place in the first quarter.", "These increased expenses were partially offset by our cost savings initiatives in the second half of 2011. Operating profit for the first quarter totaled $283 million, an increase of 12% over prior year. First quarter operating margin was 30%, representing an increase of 200 basis points. The increase over the prior year was a result of the roll-off of the currency hedges as well as our continued focus on realizing operational efficiencies, while selectively investing in growth opportunities.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $1 million of interest income, a loss of $400,000 from other items and foreign exchange gains and the interest expense of $30 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 28.4%, in-line with expectations. Compared to the same quarter of last year, the rate was up primarily due to the exploration of the R&D tax credit. We do not expect the R&D tax credit to be extended prior to the fourth quarter of 2012.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 183.1 million shares. In Q1, we have repurchased 4 million shares for $185 million. With this repurchase, we will have approximately 2 million -- $200 million remaining on our authorization. As Greg mentioned, we made 2 tuck-in acquisitions in the areas of Animal Health and Food Safety as we continued to execute against our strategy to grow in Applied Sciences. Neither of these acquisitions is expected to have a material impact on our financial results this year.", "Our GAAP diluted earnings per share for the first quarter were $0.72. On a non-GAAP basis, diluted earnings per share were $0.99. Our non-GAAP earnings per share exclude noncash interest expense, business integration and other charges and acquisition-related amortization expense.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $262 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $882 million. The expected decline in our cash position was driven by several onetime cash payments. These included the Ion milestone payment of $193 million, the retirement of our final convertible bond for $450 million, $185 million of share repurchases and our annual employee bonus payment. ", "Cash from operating activities was $104 million. Capital expenditures were $25 million and free cash flow was $79 million. Operating cash flow and free cash flows were impacted by a portion of the Ion Torrent milestone payment, approximately $30 million of which was considered operating expense and the annual bonus payments.", "Return on invested capital was 9%. We remain committed to achieving our goal of 10% ROIC by the end of 2012. Our ending debt as of March 31 was approximately $2.4 billion. This balance is made up of our senior notes of $2.3 billion plus some short-term debt. As Greg has already stated, we are maintaining our full year revenue and EPS guidance for 2012. While currency provided a $0.03 benefit to our first quarter results compared to the December 2011 month-end rates we used for guidance, our fundamental outlook for the year has not changed. Currency will likely to continue to fluctuate throughout the course of the year, but it has no impact on our underlying business.", "As we promised in February, we will update our currency assumptions quarterly. Recall that last quarter, our 2012 guidance for currency was at December month-end rates, which net of the hedge roll-off benefit was a headwind of $26 million to revenue and a benefit of $0.02 to EPS.", "At March month-end rates, currency net of the hedge roll-off has a nominal impact on revenue and would positively impact our EPS by an incremental $0.09 for the full year. For the first quarter, we realized a $0.03 benefit compared to our guidance, so the incremental benefit for the year should March month-end rates prevail would be approximately $0.06.", "Now let me provide some color on our expectations for Q2. We expect our revenue, excluding currency, to be flat compared to second quarter 2011 revenue of $945 million, which had benefited from over $30 million in SOLiD instrument sales. We are expecting our gross margins to be up year-over-year, largely due to the 5500 upgrades that negatively impacted Q2 last year, with this effect partially offset by the drop in royalty revenue. We expect gross margins to be down sequentially due to our product mix, primarily Ion Torrent. Our operating expenses are expected to be up year-over-year and sequentially due to the continuing investments in Greater China and Ion Torrent and the impact of our annual merit increase, which takes effect in the second quarter. Because of these dynamics, we're expecting our EPS to be in the range of $0.96 to $1.", "Consistent with our original guidance, our second quarter tax rate will also likely be 28.6%. In February, we guided to a share count of 184 million to 186 million shares. Given the number of shares we repurchased in the first quarter, it is likely that the share count for the full year will be at the lower end of that range. And with that, I'll now hand the call back over to Carol.", "Carol A. Cox", "Great. Thank you, David. We'll open up the call to questions and answers. I would just remind everyone that we would appreciate if you could limit yourself to one question per person, that way we can get through as many people as possible. Thank you. Karen, if you could open up the line?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Quick question for me is just on revenues. Greg, if you think about your guidance for the year, would you mind maybe just describing how you feel about that guidance given that your comps get a little bit harder throughout the year? And maybe how you're thinking about what the most important drivers are for you to see that revenue growth accelerate, and sorry for the voice [indiscernible].", "Gregory T. Lucier", "No worries. If we look at the first quarter, as I said in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with our performance relative to our expectations as we started 2012. As we go through the course of the year, there are a couple of important initiatives inside the company that we think will move the needle on the revenue. The first, obviously, is the continued release of new technology out of Ion Torrent, more specifically the Proton device. Mark Stevenson and I just got done a program review. We're very encouraged by the progress, and we think that will have a material impact on our revenue profile through the year. Second, I would point out, our strategy around becoming ever more competitive in terms of market share growth in the core research business. Our strategy around creating a value continuum of different price points of technologies is starting to pay off and we think will also have an impact on our revenue line increasingly through the year. So those are just 2 points I would share with you. There are others that make us feel good and confident that we will achieve the guidance we're sharing with our investors.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Greg, I wanted to just understand your view of the academic government end market and its impact on labs from now to the end of the year. I know if we looked at last year, in the back half of 2011, you saw labs start to slow their purchasing in the back half. Your comps get -- you're expecting organic growth to accelerate in the back half of '12, but there may be this similar dynamic of labs slowing down purchases in the back half of '12. So can you walk us through your view of how the rest of the year plays out with this end market and how you grow through that?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Our guidance is based on a view that the purchasing profile that we see in labs will not have a dramatic slowdown in the second half of the year. We've had a number of different conversations with officials from the NIH and other individuals with important decision-making in Washington that really lead us to believe that their own behavior in terms of grants and otherwise is not to have this type of slowdown. They're very focused in obviously what the 2013 budget will be, what the decisions will be around sequestration. But their whole approach right now is business as usual for 2012, granting out important grants, and that's the assumption by which our guidance is based.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And if I could just clarify, just the Proton launch in the second half, your view there is clearly growth straight through the back half of the year in addition to PGM?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "That's correct. In our view, the economics around the Proton technology are incredibly compelling, whether it's in research or in clinical usage. And we think it will have a very strong uptake.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Quintin Lai from Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Today is a -- we've had a lot of different reports here and you had a nice quarter. I'm interested, if we parse it out, consumables versus instruments, we had an instrument provider earlier today have a miss. We had a consumables-only provider put up a solid number and then your solid number. Maybe talk a little bit about the dynamics that you saw on those 2 sides of the businesses, Greg?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "On the instrumentation side, you could make a generalization that there will be increased utilization of instrumentation in the world of Life Sciences, and that makes sense as dollars become more precious. But within that generalization, I think it's important to note there are clear exceptions. An example being next-generation sequencing and more broadly, Genetic Analysis is a irreversible, undeniable growth trend and we play very squarely with our products there and certainly our investments there on instrumentation. In the world of consumables -- my comments would be that it's a stable environment, but it's a very competitive environment. And I actually think our position in terms of being very large in this channel, being able to offer economics across different price points, being able to offer larger purchasing packages to our clients, plays extremely well in terms of the current economic situation we find ourselves in. And that's allowing us to feel, again, confident but cautious that we'll achieve the guidance we're sharing with you here for 2012.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Since this is the first call you've done since you kind of realigned the divisions, are you able to maybe guide us in terms of the R&D breakout for the divisions? And I guess the underlying question here is if you're investing a lot in Research Consumables, the funding dynamics are a little bit more challenged. Can you talk about maybe the return for the Research Consumable business, R&D dollars in particular?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, Tycho. It's Mark Stevenson here. So let me just break out, I think, maybe the priorities. We've said before for R&D, the #1 remains in next-generation sequencing, so investment that we're doing around Ion Torrent, as we said, takes about 1/3 of our investment. We continue to invest strongly across consumables, but as a percentage of revenue, it is less but we see still good opportunity for workflow improvement, for new assays and innovation in that space. And the third area is really into the applied and the commercial area, so you see new products coming out across BioProduction, Food and Animal Health and increasingly into the Medical Sciences. So those are really our priorities across that. We have sized investment against the greatest growth opportunities, so when you look at the R&D productivity we've taken a very disciplined approach to making sure we get great returns on that investment and monitor and measure that very closely really by product to market area to ensure we get great returns.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then with regards to Ion Torrent, as you've talked about before, there's an upgrade program for SOLiD customers. You've obviously got the installed bases CE systems. Can you just talk about some of the dynamics in terms of swapping out some of your legacy systems and any color you can provide on expectations for PGM? I know you don't want to break a lot of that out going forward, but just wondering in the near term given that you're still early days in the ramp?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, I would pick up on your last point and I think we really are still early days in the ramp and what's very interesting to continue to see is the strength in both CE and TaqMan business for validation of those studies, and so a lot of what we're seeing at the moment is additional capacity added to either labs that already had next-generation sequencing or to new labs who -- this is their first next-generation sequencing. So really, although we're offering that, it's really a loyalty program, a trade-in. A lot of this is new capacity going into additional labs.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And the last one for Greg, just to clarify, I mean, you talked about kind of the academic markets being relatively stable but you're calling for America's to be kind of flat here against, I guess, a 3% comp for the near term. I mean, are you starting to see -- I guess the labs have been more conservative about their spending in anticipation of going back into the funding debate relative to a year ago. I'm just trying to reconcile that with the guidance.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, so in terms of reconciling what David said about Q2 is simply due to the bolus in SOLiD orders that shipped and were recognized in 2011. That is a particular issue per se. But more generally, we're not seeing a change in buying behavior by the labs at this current level. We think it's stepped down from 2011. We're at a stable rate now and we don't see disruption to that pattern for the course of 2012.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Greg, on this call it seems like there's more discussion around your proteome technologies, like fluorescence microscopy. Is it because of your product line or are you seeing a change in that market growth on the proteomics validation side of the market?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "What we would say to you is we're realizing that this area of personalized medicine that uses genomic profiling to better target therapies is going to be very exciting, very large, and it will also involve the proteome as well. And as we are building out our strategy with Ronnie Andrews, I think one of the differentiators for us is that we will not just be in the genomics side of things, we'll be in a more broader-based solutions provider that will include genomic, proteomic and other aspects of our technology, obviously, around morphology, and that's going to, I think, really bode well for us as we play out the -- what is, as Ronnie has seen come in, quite an arsenal of technology.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly, you've added headcount in China. Is this a situation where you're seeing the demand or do you have to drive the demand in that marketplace?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "China for us has continued to be a very strong market. Nothing ever just comes to you obviously, so we work for that. But as we have said in previous calls, our strategy in China is to become ever more local and ever more direct. And so we have built probably one of the finest distribution networks across that country in terms of being able to move biologically active products extremely efficiently, and quickly. We are building out a direct sales channel city-by-city so that we can have scientific conversations. Our customer support and technical support is growing in terms of the Chinese language. And we are increasingly moving to an e-commerce strategy that we have deployed extremely successfully in many other countries around the world. And that's, I think, contributing to the continued double-digit growth we're seeing in China.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of David Ferreiro of Oppenheimer & Co.", "Joshua Riegelhaupt - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "This is Josh in for Dave. You guys talked a little bit about BioProduction. I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on Forensics, how that grew into the quarter or what's kind of the drivers and how you're thinking of that moving forward?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Our Forensics business had a very good quarter in Q1. We continue to see the playing out of the trends that we've shared with our investors before in terms of internationalization. We had a couple of big orders in our key countries around the world. We have continued to launch new products in terms of particular profiling technologies for key countries that we think will unlock future growth. And we're looking at new instrumentation in that market that should help us in the ensuing quarters around a broader definition of not just using DNA, but human identification, and we're excited about that platform.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Just want to understand the dynamic behind the FX outlook changes and then the -- some modest accretion from the capital review of the share repurchase in the quarter. Should we take the comments to mean the company will reinvest kind of the contribution here? Or will you let it flow assuming the dynamic actually materializes on the FX side, all else being equal? I just want to understand how we should view the '12 or so sense of incremental accretion from FX and share repurchases.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, Jon, this is David. I think we'll have to see as the year advances in terms of what our investment opportunities are, et cetera. But at this point in time, the change in currency, we would expect to flow through. I mean, we saw a pretty significant fluctuation in currency this quarter. We've seen a lot of fluctuation over the last several quarters. I mean, who knows where we're going be by the time the year ends up.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Yes, right, that was my question. Just if the current outlook actually materializes, how do you treat that? I got it. And then last on the stimulus, I think you kind of talked about a $40 million headwind last quarter, $10 million quarterly run rate. Can you update us, David, on what you actually saw in the first quarter, if it was discernible? Did you actually see that $10 million step-down, that you kind of contemplated, let's say, in your guidance for '12?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, we did, I mean as best we could measure and we've talked about this before. It's a tricky thing, given 80% of our business is relatively small dollar per order consumables, but as best we can tell, yes, we saw a step-down of $10 million in the quarter and we expect it will be $40 million for the year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I just want to ask -- start off with a general BioProduction question. So is there -- what are the trends in the market? I mean, you came off last year in the -- when we had the cell culture systems business, it wasn't as -- BioProduction wasn't as strong last year as it was in the prior year in terms of doing it like that. Are you expecting bolus orders to come through this year, bigger orders this year. What's the pipeline look like for new starts of drugs or increasing demand from the industrial BioProduction side?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "So Gary, this is Mark. The pipeline and the general trends still look very positive for us. And we continue to track and make sure that our media -- and actually expanded beyond the media, our separation media, the porous material and our analytics are all part of this BioProduction story. I think what you will see are -- the sort of 2-year period and at each quarter is some variation as we have larger drugs come into production or some stocking. Actually, we did have a strong year last year and this Q1, we were comping our growth rate of nearly 20%, and so that's why you might see the growth slightly lower in the second quarter. But over the trend of a couple of years, we expect to see mid-to-high single digits in this market with our BioProduction business.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And just, David, can you clarify, was there any -- did you guys have an extra day in the quarter because of the leap year?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "We did have an extra day in the quarter. It turned out that the extra day was a Friday, so it had relatively minimal impact.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You issued a press release today on your Proton placement at Baylor. Is the timing of that placement in-line with your expectations? And I guess, just as importantly, when will Proton be more broadly available for shipment? And could you refresh timelines on Proton II availability? I think there's some question about whether it's possible that there could be user data available on Proton II generated in time for ASHG?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, firstly, with regards to the press release we put out in Baylor, that was exactly as per our timelines that we set out at the beginning of the year. So if you remember, the timeline was to make the Proton with the I Chip broadly commercially available in mid-2012. The early access customers, we started shipping here with Baylor and that went extremely well, and got up and running very quickly. Between now and the end of the third quarter, which will be full commercial release, you'll see more data and you'll see more shipments come out. And so that's what you can expect over the next couple of months. We still remain absolutely on track for commercial release of the Proton II Chip on the Proton instrument 6 months later. And again, as you've seen with other chips and we've really learned a lot from having done this all last year with the 314 chip, 316 and the 318. We learned a lot in the development, we released early access data and then we're shipping to customers. So you'll see the same as we generate data and we start to ship to customers the second chip. So we're very confident everything's going well. As Greg mentioned, we had a program review and we feel very confident things are tracking to our plans we laid out at the beginning of the year.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and I guess one follow-up. In the second quarter last year, Life was negatively affected by some of the changes that you guys had made in Greater China. As we get closer to annualizing the changes you made, can you talk a little bit about some of the benefits you saw associated with those changes and more recent changes in that region that materialized in Q1? And then, I guess, specific to the issues or I should say the changes from last year, how should we think about comparability related to changes in Greater China?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, the changes that we made over the last -- longer now, 18 months, has been to continue to become more of a direct seller in China. And since that Q2 point of 2011, we posted double-digit earnings and revenue growth in China. And so as we've said, in this forum and others that we think that strategy is absolutely the right one. It has certainly paid off and I think it will allow us to build a much bigger business over the course of time. So everything in China is moving according to our strategy and we're feeling really good about the results that we had in Q1.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "And sorry, I guess one other part of that is just getting up the comparability in Q2. It just -- it seems like it would be a favorable comp just given some of the timing of the changes you made in Q2 last year?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, I think our growth rate in Greater China has been in the high teens. And we said that it would take time for us to put the strategy in place, but we would expect to see quarter-on-quarter improvement, which we have. And so I would expect that we'd be somewhere in that ballpark in the second quarter and for the rest of the year.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan of Credit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Most of mine actually have been answered. But just a couple following up on the Ion Torrent line here. Just if you could maybe parse out a little bit with the new competition. Let's see, Illumina made some comments yesterday regarding market share in terms of revenues and how that might, if you have any comments there. I know you don't want to give too much color going forward, but just what you see there in terms of share for PGM versus the main competitor there on the desktop side?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Well, yes, we still feel very good about the positioning first of our PGM instrument. And have continued to get good, strong placement and win share during the second full year that we've been going now. So the first quarter was as expected for us. We won units and new customers and existing. Particularly strong was the AmpliSeq uptake for us and with those customers who want to do panels and sets of genes, that was very strong. We started taking orders for Proton and that's really a game-changer as we start to take multiple orders for those systems, and feel good about getting prepared to start shipping those, as we say, coming up to the third quarter here and I think that will really position us strongly not only in the segment of the market we're being at genes, but now to enable the market to address exomes and whole genomes as we start shipping the Proton system. So I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning we have and we're all set for the year.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "And just one more if I could follow up just on that same sort of topic. Looking forward kind of end of the year next year, obviously, might get new competition in the space. Are you sensing any sort of hesitation or are people holding back on making purchases in anticipation of what might be coming?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "We haven't seen that. I mean, really customers want to get going in their research. I mean, this is a very fast-moving space, so customers really want to get going, get results and so we've seen broad adoption. We continue to release upgrades to the system so as we've done each quarter, we're improving the performance of the system. We're focused on ease of use of the PGM, the AmpliSeq more on the improvements and the accuracy and read length. So customers are really appreciating now that these -- in the roadmap we have, they're getting better and better performance out of the systems as we go forward. So that's really the feedback we're getting from the marketplace.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to ask maybe a long-term question to start regarding the Applied Sciences business. If we think about the secular growth that we're likely to see in the research world, give or take, the near-term budgetary environment, I think it's safe to argue that it's probably not going to return to the rate of growth that we've seen in the 90s. And so if we look at the Applied side of the business, there's obviously a lot better secular growth demand there to work with. So I'm just wondering if you're looking at M&A opportunities, is it fair to say you guys are maybe more inclined to look at assets that would fit into that part of your operating structure?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I think that's a fair gauge of how we are thinking about capital deployment if we do an acquisition.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then not to harp on this too much, but if we look at the impact of the extra day in the quarter, just want to tease out exactly what you thought the impact was? It sounded like you thought it was pretty de minimis, but if you just kind of help quantify that, that will be very helpful.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "I don't think we want to go into the details of that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I was just hoping you could provide us an update with your efforts to improve margins at Ion Torrent?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, so a couple of things going on. Firstly, on the PGM side, we actually moved and started this quarter production in our Singapore operating plant. And that allows us to both improve margins and also start to build in a factory that is a regulated factory. It's where we build our qPCR instruments that have 510(k) approval, and so that has dual advantage. Also, as we're seeing more uptake on consumables, we have the opportunity, again, to in-source some of the components and build those kits ourselves and just we have greater margin in the consumable uptakes. So both of those things will result in improved margins as we go through the year related to Ion Torrent product line.", "Operator", "And we also have a question from the line of Bill Bonello from RBC Capital.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I just want to revisit the earlier discussion of the currency and the way you're thinking about that relative to guidance, because you did increase the benefit that you expect to get from currency but you did not increase the EPS guidance. And I understand being conservative because that currency can fluctuate quite a bit. What I'm trying to understand, though, is on the cost side. If there's anything that switched or changed relative to when you last gave the EPS guidance. So is there anything on the margin front, on the expense front that you expect to be a little bit different, that sort of offsetting some of that anticipated currency tailwind?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "You mean for the full year?", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Yes.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "I don't think that there's anything in particular that we're expecting that's going to be different from our outlook that we've provided last quarter.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. So just to think about that, then, if the currency does hold at the rates where it is in March even though you're not raising your guidance, it would be likely to think of that as either putting you towards the high end or above -- of the guidance?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "That's correct, that was John's earlier question.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. I just wasn't sure. I know that's what he was asking, I wasn't sure I understood the answer exactly.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, that is the answer and we'll take a look at currency at the end of next quarter and we'll decide at that point in time if it looks like we want to raise guidance. At this stage, we've gotten $0.03 above what we originally thought. But as we've said, currency has been so unpredictable the last couple of years so we just think it's premature to raise it at this point.", "Bill Bonello - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I'll ask my last one question, which is, is the Ion Proton launch -- is that kind of a 3 month-ish delay from maybe what you'd been initially expecting when you said mid-2012?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "No, Bill. That's exactly on track for middle of the year, so nothing changed from our roadmap in January and everything is good. As we said then, we would announce milestones like we announced today when we started shipping to the early access customers and we're on track for full commercial release between now and the end of the third quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier from the Maxim Group.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division", "Just kind of getting back to the funding environment. We've known about the funding environment in the U.S. and the potential impact in the back half of the year, but I think that the strong first quarter and your outlook for the second quarter is above my expectation. Have you -- do you have more concerns about the U.S. funding environment? I don't want to beat a dead horse, but I think that despite the headwinds of the currency that we could still see a stronger back half of the year, depending on the funding environment.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I'm not sure I understand your question. So are you saying that we could see it stronger...", "Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division", "Well, so I mean, I guess when you said that you saw a stronger first quarter and -- or it was above what we were expecting and the second quarter is above what I'm expecting, but you haven't -- you didn't really raise your revenue outlook for the year.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "That's right. And I think it really falls into this philosophy David used around the currency question is, we're just going to be very cautious. We don't see a deterioration of research spending in the United States across 2012. And equally, we're not banking on it strengthening either, and so our guidance, we think, is built on a reasonable cautious assumption of the spending profile through 2012.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division", "And just quickly lastly, on -- with the economic customers in your conversations with the economic customers and their purchasing expectations, can that be applied to their view of their -- of the whole Life science industry or were your conversations really pretty specific to your product portfolio?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I think that our comments would be a broad brush for biomedical research spending. Now having said that, within that overall generalization, as we have said, there is certainly a real focus on Genetic Analysis, next-generation sequencing, stem cell research still, and those are the key areas where we are investing our R&D efforts accordingly.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Dan Arias from UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Greg or Mark, I appreciate the comments on some of the directions you're going in for Genetic Analysis. In that vein, I'm wondering whether you'd be willing to make a rough guess percentage-wise -- what you think the breakdown of installed PGMs looks like by the end of the year, just in terms of research labs versus clinically focused labs. Just trying to better understand the pacing of the application expansion here.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Maybe we'll fric and frac on that one. In the research side, it's -- there's many, many different opportunities because I think, as Mark said, we are seeing the democratization of sequencing across research. It's hypothesis free. It is becoming ever more the starting point for more and more experiments in Life Science research. So that's all good and that plays to our cards, if you will, that we want to be evermore that essential research provider of key tools. On the diagnostics side or clinical side, obviously that is a enormous market opportunity and we're seeing commensurate uptake of the product there as well. And as we've said, we're doing a number of things to further penetration there. We are seeking a 510(k) on the PGM. We've hired Ronnie Andrews. We think this AmpliSeq technology is an absolute game-changer and the more that people understand that, the more they'll realize the words we're saying. And so we have actually created a focused selling force around the clinical opportunities that is very experienced in that domain. And we think that'll be evermore of a percentage of what we're doing. But I would just conclude, we see ourselves us a diversified technology company. Sequencing, Genetic Analysis is very important, but it's one of several things we're doing to drive growth and create shareholder value, and that's why we're not going to get into this discrete submarket clarification because I think it just doesn't play to what we're saying to investors of being a very strong technology company.", "Carol A. Cox", "Okay. Thanks, Karen. You can repeat the replay information for everyone.

Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ", "Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until May 18, 2012. A copy of the press release of our 2012 first quarter and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.

So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today. We had an excellent first quarter. It's always nice to report a strong start to the year, and I'm pleased to say that we continued our trend of consistently delivering double-digit growth in adjusted EPS. Our teams executed well. Our growth drivers continue to gain traction, and the cost-reduction programs we put in place delivered according to our plans. All of this added up to quarterly performance that was somewhat better than our expectations. I'll begin this morning's call by covering the financial highlights, giving you a little color on how we performed relative to our key end markets and then getting into a bit more detail on some of our growth drivers, namely product innovation and emerging markets. ", "As I mentioned, we had strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth with a 27% increase over 2011. We also delivered strong revenue growth with a 14% increase in the quarter. Our adjusted operating income rose 20%, and we increased our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points. We continued our momentum of strong financial performance into 2012, and that positioned us well to meet our goals for the year overall. ", "Let me turn to our end markets and give you a high-level overview of what we saw in Q1. First, academic and government. While these markets were down low-single digits in the quarter, they were slightly better than what we saw in the fourth quarter of 2011. We had moderate growth in Laboratory Consumables and Bioscience reagents, which tells us that scientists and researchers continue to do their important work. The capital equipment side of their spend, however, continues to be constrained as our customers are choosing to delay their larger purchases. ", "Conditions in health care and diagnostics were similar to what we've seen over the last several quarters with one exception. This quarter, we experienced weak demand from our seasonal flu and allergy products. As you probably know, it was a light flu season this year, and we also saw the impact of unusually low pollen levels on our seasonal allergy product sold in Japan. Sales of our clinical diagnostic products remain strong, as they have for quite a few quarters now, driven by continued demand for our innovative biomarker tests such as our PCT marker for diagnosing sepsis. ", "Turning to industrial and applied markets. We saw continued strength across our portfolio with solid performance in our businesses serving these end markets. A couple examples were strong sales of our molecular spectroscopy instruments for quality control laboratories, as well as robust demand for our Process Instruments from mining and minerals customers. ", "Last in pharmaceutical and biotech, we continue to grow rapidly and gain share with these customers. We had another excellent quarter in our BioProcess Production business with strong sales of sera, media and single-use disposable production systems. ", "Our Biopharma Services business, where we are the largest outsourcing partner for clinical trial logistics, continues to grow in the double digits. Given that some of our largest customers are in the biopharma space, I spent quite a bit of time with them. I recently met with the ahead of R&D in one large pharma company and the head of manufacturing in another. The feedback on the impact that we're having on their business is extremely positive, and we continue to jointly identify opportunities for further collaboration. We believe that our scale and depth of capabilities position Thermo Fisher with Biopharma customers better than any other company in our industry. We're committed to building on these relationships. ", "One area that we're very excited about is our companion diagnostics program. This is in the early stages, but we've leveraged our strong relationships to get in front of the right decision makers in pharma R&D organizations. And we believe that we're uniquely positioned to build up a meaningful companion diagnostics business. Our goal is to be the key partner for the pharma industry by developing and marketing the diagnostic kits they need to support their new product launches. ", "Let me now turn to our new products. Given some of the unique relationships we have with our customers, we gained great insight into their emerging needs. And that really helps to guide our product development strategy. We also vet our R&D priorities with our Scientific Advisory Board, which includes representatives from some of the world's premier centers of health, science and academia. ", "Before I get into the new product highlights from the last few months, let me just mention here that sales of our Q Exactive mass spec, which we introduced last year at ASMS, continues to be very strong. Our customers are clearly seeing the benefit of this high-performance instrument with great uptake in a number of applications, including from those doing protein and peptide analysis to identify disease markers, as well as for small molecule identification and quantitation in metabolomic studies and for those doing food safety testing. ", "In terms of the new product launches, we have a great lineup so far this year. Based on the early feedback, I believe 2012 will be a banner year considering the range of new technologies introduced and the success they will have with a broad base of customers. We showcase many of these new capabilities at PITTCON in the U.S. in Q1 and at analytica in Germany just last week. This includes a long list of innovative, new Thermo Scientific products across our Analytical Technologies segment that addresses the need of customers in all of our key end markets. ", "Let me take a few minutes to cover some of the highlights. At PITTCON, we debuted our new ion chromatography platform, the ICS-4000, which is the world's first integrated capillary high-pressure IC system. It's ideal for high-volume environmental and industrial laboratories that demand rapid analysis without compromising performance. ", "The powerful combination of Thermo Scientific and Dionex is already paying dividends for our gas chromatography customers as well, and our introduction of the new TRACE 1300 is an excellent example. This compact, versatile GC system, which can be used for QA/QC and routine environmental, chemical and food safety analysis, runs on the gold standard Chromeleon Chromatography Data System. The TRACE 1300 brings new capabilities and productivity to a product category that hasn't seen any significant technology developments for years. ", "Continuing our legacy of innovation in mass spectrometry, we launched the new iCAP Q, an ultracompact, highly sensitive ICP mass spec that cuts analysis time by 50% compared with the current ICP-MS it replaces. The iCAP Q is ideal for clinical research, environmental, food safety and semiconductor applications that cover both routine and complex elemental analyses. Demand has been incredibly robust, and we've already booked and shipped a significant number of instruments. ", "With our depth of capabilities, we're in a unique position to leverage our technology platforms to create entirely new growth markets. Our new TruNarc analyzer, for example, literally puts Raman spectroscopy in the hands of law enforcement for the rapid identification of suspected narcotics. TruNarc is already gaining real interest here in the U.S. and in China as well. ", "Finally, we introduced new products that improve routine workflows for life science researchers. One example is the PikoReal quantitative PCR System, which is an affordable, high-performance benchtop instrument that's integrated with our Bioscience reagents and consumables for the molecular biology workflow. ", "We're clearly in a strong, new product development cycle, and we'll be launching a number of additional products for the remainder of the year. I look forward to covering our new innovations on future calls, as well as updating you on the results of our launches from the past few months. ", "I'll now make some quick comments on emerging markets, another key growth driver for us. I recently got back from a trip to China, and I'm pleased to see that our continued investment in the region is really paying off. China came in at 20% revenue growth in the first quarter with continued strong demand from customers in multiple end markets. ", "When I'm in China, I often spend much of my time visiting customers in Shanghai and Beijing, which is also where our main offices and production facilities are located. This particular trip, I traveled to Western and Central China to meet with customers and government officials in those regions to better understand their needs and how we can translate them into new growth drivers for Thermo Fisher. ", "You may recall that we opened a new commercial center in Chengdu in Central China last year. We also opened a commercial center in Shenyang, and during my recent trip, announced the opening of a new office in Wuhan. We're also on-track to open our new Xuzhou factory in Q3, where we'll manufacture lab consumables for our life science customers in the region. It's clear that there are huge opportunities across the country, and I'm confident that our capabilities are perfectly aligned with China's growing needs in diagnostic medicine that's seen [ph] production and environmental monitoring, as outlined in this 5-year plan. ", "We're also intensifying our focus in other high-growth markets like South Korea, where we recently opened a new application and customer demo center, as well as in Brazil and Russia, where we're expanding our commercial presence. Our strategy in these markets is to replicate the successful formula we have implemented in countries like China and India. We continue to make investments to drive growth, and it's great to see that they're creating value for our customers and strengthening our company overall. I've never been more excited about the excellent opportunities we have through our ongoing commitment to high impact innovation and expansion in global markets that have high rates of growth. ", "We also continue to create significant value for our shareholders as well by effectively deploying our capital. Our stock is a very attractive investment, and we repurchased $300 million of our shares during the quarter. As you know, we also initiated the first quarterly cash dividend in our company's history, which was just paid in mid-April. The decision by our board to incorporate a dividend into our capital deployment strategy is based on our strong financial performance, our track record of strong cash flow generation and our excellent opportunities for growth. ", "Turning to guidance. Pete will cover the details in his comments, but given the better-than-anticipated FX rates and our strong Q1 results, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS estimates for 2012. We're raising our annual revenue guidance to a new range of $12.27 billion to $12.43 billion for 5% to 6% revenue growth year-over-year. This translates to adjusted EPS of $4.71 to $4.83, which will result in 13% to 16% adjusted EPS growth over 2011. Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me summarize the key takeaways from the quarter.", "We're pleased with our strong performance and start to 2012 with good top line results and excellent adjusted EPS growth. Our growth initiatives are on track with excellent new products and great progress in emerging markets. And with our continued focus on driving growth while prudently managing our costs in line with market conditions, I'm confident that we'll continue our momentum and achieve our goals for the year. Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with an overview of the total company's financial performance, and then I'll provide some color on each of our 3 segments before moving on to our updated guidance.", "As Marc stated, we had another quarter of double-digit growth and adjusted EPS, with 27% growth to our first quarter record of $1.17. GAAP EPS in Q1 was $0.75, up 17%. ", "Starting with the top line. Total revenue increased 14% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned in the prior year, both reported and organic revenues increased by 4%. Pro forma revenue included 1% growth from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia, which was offset by a 1% headwind in foreign currency translation. ", "We also continued to strengthen backlog with bookings exceeding revenue by about 2% and all 3 segments contributing. ", "By geography, North America grew in the low-single digits. Europe grew in the mid-single digits, and Asia-Pacific in the high-single digits, but China coming in at strong again at 20% growth, as Marc mentioned. Rest of World, which is less than 5% of our revenue, declined in the low-single digits versus a tough comparison due to several large project orders in Q1 last year. ", "Turning to adjusted operating income. We had strong bottom line results with Q1 adjusted operating income up 20%. Adjusted operating margin was 18.5%, up 90 basis points with margin expansion driven by strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions, solid accretion from Dionex and Phadia and good pull-through on our organic growth. We did experience some unfavorable mix in the quarter as a result of weakness in specialty diagnostic seasonal products related to allergy and flu, which have higher-than-average margins. And similar to last quarter, inflation on oil-based raw materials like plastic resin continues to be a slight headwind, but we continue to push hard on sourcing actions to offset these pressures. We're executing as planned on the incremental restructuring actions that we initiated last year and realized about $12 million in benefit in the quarter. ", "Moving on to details of the P&L. As I stated previously, the Dionex and Phadia acquisitions both have higher-than-average gross margins, as well as higher-than-average SG&A and R&D expense. So until they anniversary, you'll see their impact on our year-over-year margins. Total company adjusted gross margin was 44.3% in Q1, up 180 basis points from the prior year. Gross margin benefited from the impact of acquisitions, our standard productivity actions and the increase in site consolidation efforts, but mix was somewhat unfavorable. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 22.9% of revenue, up 70 basis points. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, we delivered meaningful SG&A leverage as we tightly controlled discretionary costs and restructured our cost base while continuing to fund our growth investments. Last, R&D expense was 3%, up 20 basis points as a result of acquisitions. ", "Below the line, net interest expense increased $29 million year-over-year to $51 million driven by higher interest expense as a result of the debt we issued last year to fund acquisitions. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 17.5%, down 300 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of tax synergies we're recognizing from acquisitions, as well as the benefit of our ongoing tax planning initiatives. ", "We bought back shares pretty aggressively in Q1 and deployed another $300 million of cash to buy back 6 million shares of our stock at an average price of $50. Average diluted shares were 370 million in the quarter, down 25 million or 6%, reflecting the benefit of our 2011 and 2012 share buyback programs, as well as redemption of our remaining convertible debt in the first half of last year. ", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. We continued to generate solid cash flow this quarter. Cash flow from continuing operations was $393 million, and free cash flow was $328 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $65 million in the quarter. Free cash flow was up 25% year-over-year, primarily as a result of higher income and lower cash taxes. We ended the quarter with about $800 million in cash and investments, down $225 million from Q4. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $6.7 billion, down $350 million from Q4 as a result of paying down some of our outstanding commercial paper. ", "Now let me give you some color on this quarter's performance by each of our 3 segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies, total revenue grew 21%. On a pro forma basis, assuming Dionex was owned in the prior year, Analytical Technologies' total revenue increased 6%, and organic revenue growth was 7%. We continued to see strong growth both in instruments sold to biopharma, industrial and applied markets, as well as in our businesses serving bioprocess production. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased 35%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.4%, up 190 basis points. This was the result of pull-through on strong organic growth, contribution from our productivity actions and good accretion from our acquisitions. ", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. Total revenue grew 27%. On a pro forma basis, assuming Phadia was owned in the prior year, total revenue and organic revenue both grew 1%. We continued to see strong growth in clinical diagnostics, particularly in our biomarkers business. However, as I mentioned earlier, this segment experienced soft demand for seasonal products due to a very weak pollen season in Japan and the weaker-than-average global flu season. Adjusted operating income increased 31% with adjusted operating margin at 25.5%, up 90 basis points. ", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, total revenue and organic revenue both increased by 4%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in Laboratory Consumables, and our Biopharma Services business continued to deliver strong results. Similar to the last quarter, this segment was affected by the challenging conditions in our academic and government markets, primarily in routine laboratory equipment, including laboratory workstations. Adjusted operating income grew 1% with adjusted operating margin coming in at 13.4%. This was 40 basis points below the year-ago quarter but up 20 basis points sequentially from Q4. We continued to generate strong productivity gains in this segment, but this was more than offset by unfavorable mix and operational performance in our laboratory workstation business. ", "Now moving on to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're increasing the high end of our 2012 revenue guidance by $80 million as a result of more favorable FX rates, and we're increasing the low end of our guidance by an additional $40 million as a result of our strong performance in Q1. This leads to a new revenue guidance range of $12.27 billion to $12.43 billion, which represents reported growth of 5% to 6%. ", "On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for all of the prior year, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance remains at about 3% but is slightly higher than our previous guidance. Although rates have improved somewhat, this guidance still assumes an unfavorable year-over-year FX impact of about $325 million in revenue, which results in a 3% headwind on adjusted EPS. ", "We're also assuming that completed acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia will contribute a little less than 0.05% to our expected growth in 2012. As usual, we haven't attempted to forecast future FX rates, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. ", "In terms of full year 2012 adjusted EPS guidance, we're also raising the high end and tightening the range. This is driven by the higher revenue, which is partially offset by a slightly higher share count as a result of a higher stock price. Our revised adjusted EPS guidance range is $4.71 to $4.83, which represents 13% to 16% growth over 2011. So the bridge from the midpoint of our previous guidance to our current guidance is a $0.05 increase from the incremental revenue offset by about $0.025 dilution from share count. ", "In terms of adjusted operating margin, we're still expecting expansion of 70 to 90 basis points for the year. And below the line, we're still expecting our net interest expense to be up $55 million to $60 million year-over-year and our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 17% to 18%. ", "We're estimating full year average diluted share count to be in the range of $367 million to $372 million, down 3% to 5% from last year but up slightly from our previous range due to a higher share price. This estimate assumes that we'll use the remaining $350 million of our current share buyback authorization through its expiration in mid-November of this year. ", "And finally, we're assuming that we'll deploy $150 million towards dividends, and we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million. ", "In interpreting our guidance ranges, as I said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2012 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year. So with that, let me say I'm pleased to start off the year with a strong quarter that positions us very well for solid growth in 2012.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Pete. Operator, we're ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Quintin Lai representing Robert W. Baird.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "So first question, relative to yesterday, we heard some others talk about big pharma with maybe a CapEx holdback at the start of the year. Marc, did you see any of that in your business?", "Marc N. Casper", "So from the pharmaceutical and biotech perspective, very strong performance of Thermo Fisher in the quarter. Personally, I think it reflects our customers understand the value proposition that we have and the depth of our capabilities, Quintin. I think we're very unique in how we work with these customers. We saw a great strength across our portfolio, including our Biopharma Services outsourcing business, our BioProcess Production business, as well as nice growth in our Instruments business.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And did that pacing keep up kind of through the quarter, Marc?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, the quarter was strong and -- with our pharmaceutical and biotech customers throughout Q1.", "Quintin J. Lai - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Great. And then the integration, and it looks like the things, especially with you and Dionex, are going really well. What do you think that you're seeing the biggest potential? Is it taking the new products that Dionex would have done on their own and sending it through the Thermo Fisher channels? Or is it also selling these -- the cross-selling between the 2 customer bases, some of the Legacy Thermo Fisher and Dionex products?", "Marc N. Casper", "I'm excited about -- obviously, we were excited when we did the acquisition. I'm much more excited today because a year -- we're almost a year into it, we're about 2 weeks or so away from that. And integration has gone flawlessly. We're well ahead of our synergy targets. We have integrated the business, and the teams are working great together. When you look at where the opportunities are, they go across a huge range of areas. Some of them is the obvious one, the cross-selling, right? Each company has great commercial reach, and we're helping the Legacy Dionex business scale up and reach customers that they couldn't in the past. We're aggressively leveraging the strength that Dionex had in environmental customers to sell a lot more of our ICPs and other environmental products. Our connect rate between mass specs and liquid chromatographs are continuing to increase substantially, which means we're basically taking what would have been Legacy competition LCs and now keeping the profitability in-house. And the product development cycle as well, we are a #3 player in gas chromatography. There's a very large #1 player in terms of market share. It's been a very boring category in terms of innovation, and we took the incredible Dionex software with very unique innovations in our hardware platform and are aggressively going after the gas chromatography market. So I think it's going well. It's going well on a number of fronts, and I feel we're just getting started.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel representing Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Pete, based on your prepared remarks about guidance where I believe you said you increased the low end of the full year revenue guidance range by $40 million due to the Q1 beat, if it's right to conclude that, that means that you beat your internal expectations by $40 million in the quarter, could you just talk about some areas where you did a little bit better than internal plan? And then in terms of full year guidance, it sounds like all you did is just adjust for the Q1 beat and the changes in FX given that it does seem like you did a little bit better than internal plan in Q1. Could you just talk about the thinking or the reasoning behind not being a little bit more aggressive with the guidance?", "Marc N. Casper", "So I'll start, Doug. In terms of guidance, as you know, we always focus on the midpoint. And as the year unfolds, we make adjustments where we think it makes sense. Having the change in FX rates, we basically took that and flowed it through both the top end of the guidance and the bottom end. That was the $80 million. Because Q1 was a good quarter, above our expectations, the lowest end of the scenario in our original guidance seemed less likely, and hence, we lowered that -- excuse me, we raised that after the first quarter. That was the $40 million of operational performance. So just given a good quarter behind you, it's just less likely that you're going to have that low-end view. In terms of it's a little bit early in the year to change the high end operationally, because we still got 3 quarters ahead of us, and there's still, obviously, some uncertainty in the end market. So that's how we thought about it. If you want to say the next level is what went well relative to our expectations, yes, we saw a slight improvement in academic and government end markets. It was still down low-single digits, but it was actually a little bit better than Q4. So that was an improvement that we noted, and it was nice to see continued strength in industrial and biopharma customers across the business.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one real quick clarifying follow-up. Unlike some of your competitors, I believe you did not have an extra day in the quarter. I know that was something that's come up this morning. It's just people have asked me what the impact was. I don't think you guys had an extra day. Can you just confirm that?", "Peter M. Wilver", "That's true. We're on a fiscal calendar, so adding a day in February doesn't matter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla representing Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I appreciate your comments on the pharma end market, Marc, but I was just hoping you could go into a little bit more detail on India specifically and the performance of the biopharma end market there?", "Marc N. Casper", "India grew for us low-single digits for the company, a little bit slower than some of the recent quarters, but we did grow. And we had good momentum in our Instruments business in the quarter.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And my follow-up on the academic government end market down low-single digits, can you just give us a little bit more color on how labs are approaching 2012 and how they're thinking about the potential for budget cuts in 2013?", "Marc N. Casper", "So I think as we see, and we talk a lot to customers, basically researchers are working, right? So consumables, bioscience reagents, you're doing experiments, demand has been reasonable for those products. Capital equipment has been muted as customers are making sure that they have money to pay salaries and other things in an uncertain environment that happens later in the year. So we continue to see softer demand, particularly for more routine types of capital equipment. So our lab equipment, lower-end instruments, lab workstations saw pressures. We continue to do great, of course, with our mass spec business across a number of customers.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg representing Macquarie.", "Travis Steed - Macquarie Research", "This is Travis Steed on for Jon. Just to clarify, if currency moves more negative through the rest of the year, is that something that you're going to have to move guidance back down lower?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Certainly, we raised the guidance for FX by about $70 million -- $75 million from where we were before. If you look at today's spot rates, I would say that it should probably be a little bit higher, so I'd say we're being still a little bit conservative against spot rates. But of course, if we see a EUR 1.25 [ph], I think us and everybody else are going to have to take their guidance down. So it takes into account some minor movements, but nothing we would never try to be so conservative as to predict something like that.", "Travis Steed - Macquarie Research", "Sure. And just as a follow-up, a lot of people are talking about companion diagnostics. And what products are you planning on using to partner with pharma companion diagnostics?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of our companion diagnostics portfolio, we have the largest number of detection technologies of any company ranging from what would have historically been life science tools like mass spectrometry all the way to an incredible array of immunoassays, clinical chemistry products. Our Phadia acquisition brought great new capabilities in terms of our great strength in the autoimmunity and allergy area. So we pulled those businesses together into a unique offering where our customers can tell us the challenge that they're trying to find from a pharmaceutical perspective, and we can identify the right technology to help them tackle those needs. Given our commercial reach, once those products make it to market, we obviously have the ability to then market those diagnostic products to laboratories. So we're excited. We've always had some presence in companion diagnostics, but the combination of Phadia with Thermo Fisher gives us a really nice momentum as we focus on that area.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson representing Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Marc, just around the potential weakness of academia as we roll through the year, what can you do with -- to work with U.S. academia that's going to stop the freeze in spend?", "Marc N. Casper", "So we, along with other industry participants, are active in Washington. We talk to Congress about the importance of U.S. competitiveness and NIH spending. And we try to do the right thing for the country, which is to protect one of the core strengths of the U.S., which is our biopharmaceutical and medical device industries. So we're an active participant in trying to do that. And I know that both sides of the aisle, if you will, are very supportive of NIH spending. It's just a question of whether a budget resolution can happen at a macro level. If it does, NIH will do okay. And if it doesn't, there'll obviously be challenges.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And is there anything at the customer level you can do?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, our value proposition is very helpful, right? If you think about it, over the last 5 years, we gained a lot of share with biopharma customers by leveraging our unique offering, which is driving productivity. Those tools and learnings that we've had from that customer set are just as applicable to academic labs. So we're able to help them stretch their dollars, buy the right products, leverage our scale and depth of capabilities to drive share gains. So from that viewpoint, I feel like we're going to be very well positioned to do well in that end market even if the spending is more muted.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Jon Wood representing Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So either Marc or Pete, just going back to your comments on uses of cash, I think you guys have talked about getting the leverage ratio down probably another 50 basis points or so going into '13 from where it is today. So can you just kind of update us on how you see the M&A landscape, your appetite for incremental M&A vis-\u00e0-vis that kind of leverage goal? It seems like you've got another $400 million or $500 million of debt paydown to go this year. Is that the right way to think about it or the right level to model?", "Marc N. Casper", "So Jon, from my perspective, we will continue to evaluate M&A opportunities against our well-understood criteria. So we look at acquisitions that strengthen the company strategically, significantly improve the value proposition from a customer perspective, and of course, create shareholder value. And we continue to evaluate acquisitions. And for those that meet that criteria and we feel good about, we'd obviously pursue. And those that don't, we pass on. We've been able to improve our debt-to-EBITDA ratios on a combination of repaying debt, but also, we're growing earnings nicely. And we'll continue to focus on some level of debt reduction as we go through the year, and we'll evaluate M&A. So it's -- we don't commit to a specific number on the M&A side because we don't know whether there's going to be transactions that we like or not.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan representing Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "For the Specialty Diagnostics division, can you just quantify how much the weakness in the global flu and the weak results in Japan impact the results this quarter? And also, could you comment specifically on Phadia's performance and how it is compared with expectations?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So in terms of the flu and allergy, so seasonal-related projects -- products, it was about 50 basis points for the full company and about 2 percentage points for the segment.", "Marc N. Casper", "And in terms of Phadia, actually I think the business is performing well. If you look at U.S. allergy, which is a key growth driver for us, very strong double-digit growth. If you look at the autoimmunity business, very strong growth. Japan, a real headwind, but that's seasonal. So effectively, we always plan for a normal season. Sometimes it's better. Sometimes it's normal. Sometimes it's worse. So not a big concern one way or the other.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So how do we think about just kind of going forward? And what do you think the good normalized run rate is for the Specialty Diagnostics that we should be thinking -- using?", "Marc N. Casper", "I would say that for that business, we don't talk a huge amount about guidance by segment. But you should think about growth in the 3% to 5% type range would be -- segment growth would be a reasonable assumption over long periods of time.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson representing JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on an earlier question on guidance that Doug had asked. And if we go back, last year, obviously, I think you had raised twice and had, had issues in the third quarter. As we think about kind of your philosophy around guidance, is there a chance you're baking in a little bit more cushion here throughout this year in light of the macro backdrop?", "Marc N. Casper", "I don't want to be reminded too much of last year, Tycho, but I would say that we learn from -- every day we come to work, our job is to learn, all right? So I don't actually think it's more cushion or less cushion. I think that we're just -- we try to get smarter every day and every year, and I feel reasonable about our guidance. We think about what could go wrong in the world and what could go right and what's in our control and what's outside of our control, and we put our best view of guidance together. So we felt comfortable with raising our guidance at the end of Q1 based on our outlook.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then going back to the kind of the Biopharma issue, and I know you've had a couple of questions on this already, but we did get very different messages from one of your peers yesterday. Was -- can you just comment on whether there's a delay in the release of the pharma budgets? I mean, obviously, your numbers were good and didn't reflect that, but as you talk to pharma companies? Can you just talk about their release of budgets in kind of the March and April timeframe?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. We didn't have any Biopharma issues, so from my perspective, we're executing great in the Biopharma segment. So none of our commercial teams have mentioned once about delays in budgets or those things. So I don't know. I spent -- I visit most of the top pharmaceutical customers personally. Speak to the CEOs, as I mentioned in the call, heads of R&D, heads of manufacturing. We understand their challenges and what they're working through, and they're -- maybe we're just gaining share. I don't know, but it's performed well now quarter-after-quarter for a very long time.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, we hear a number of people asking about Amazon news this week, and it looks like they're distributing some of your products with the Amazon supply business. Can you just talk about that dynamic and how you view the channel business on a go-forward basis?", "Marc N. Casper", "The channel business is doing well. In terms of Amazon, we don't see anything material going on there.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. But they are distributing your products, so you have an agreement with them or...", "Marc N. Casper", "They're listing a few of our products. We have several hundred thousand SKUs. And I think there are 500 or so on Amazon. They're all very low volumes. So from that perspective, it's pretty -- it's truly insignificant.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan representing Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Just so -- one thing I know you talked about Dionex and Phadia improving your gross margins. Can you give any sort of sense just as we're modeling here? Can you pull that out a little bit just if -- just looking at the Legacy Thermo business, how the margins, gross margins, would have been for the quarter?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So honestly, I don't have that number in front of me. I mean, when you look at Dionex, that business is fully integrated into an existing division. Phadia is separate still. But -- so we don't have -- I know qualitatively that's the case, but I don't have the specific numbers, and we don't honestly track it. We're measuring our chromatography and mass spec division as a business now, not as 2 different pieces. So I know it's favorable, but I don't have the exact number.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. All right. And just one other question, different topic, on the companion diagnostics, following up on the earlier question. I know there's obviously other companies looking -- focused on this space also. I think one of the questions we all have is kind of what sort of financial impact can that have. And so I guess my question to you just given how large your sales base is, what type of impact do you think it could have in terms of growth? And I guess when would we maybe see that sort of impact in terms of the timing?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. From my perspective, every quarter, I pick a growth vignette, that I want to highlight to show all of the great things we have going on in the company. And sometimes I pick countries. Sometimes I pick product ranges because when you have such a dominant industry leader, it's hard sometimes to understand all the good activities going on. So in this particular quarter, I wanted to focus on companion diagnostics because it highlights -- convergence of life science tools and diagnostics and how we play. It also converges -- it also shows the impact of the new acquisition on the company. So it's really showing up in our results. Is it going to be a meaningful number? It'll take a long time, right, because drugs have to make it the pipeline, you've got to fund R&D jointly with pharmaceutical companies. But we're generating revenue. We've got a lot of good activity. We're improving our reputation. And I think we're well positioned to win in that space.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro representing Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just --  2 to start on the mass spec and pharma services side. First off, do you guys think you're gaining market share in mass spec? And secondly, in pharma services, maybe if you could comment a little bit on how fragmented you think that opportunity is and maybe the sustainability of the double-digit growth you're seeing there?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of mass spec, yes, I do believe that we're gaining share. The Q Exactive is a fantastic product, and it's doing very well. And I picked 3 very different applications in terms of where it's gaining share, and large molecule, small molecule and applied, right? So this isn't just a one-trick pony. So I feel like it's a revolutionary product. We market it that way, both to the investor community, but more importantly, to the customer community back middle of last year. And 9 months later, it's nice and no surprise that it's doing exactly what it said it was going to do. So yes, I feel good about mass spec. In terms of Biopharma Services business, we have good momentum there. It's primarily about how fast do customers move from in-house capabilities to outsourcing. So you're not -- we've had a good momentum for a lot of quarters. You won't have that every single quarter. But I think the fundamental trends of pharmaceutical companies outsourcing more to lower-cost, higher-quality producers is a trend that's going to be with us for a very long time, and we're uniquely positioned as the industry leader in that offering.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then maybe second, for modeling purposes, if I could ask a question on Phadia. I appreciate the comments you made on the seasonality you've seen year to date for the allergy and flu trend. But just also wondering if you see opportunities in the back half for major contract wins or expansion of your existing relationships in that business that can maybe help offset the typical seasonality you see in that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "No. I think the business is executing well. In terms of will we offset the Japan numbers. I don't know whether we will or won't -- the team feels very focused on trying to do that. And if we do, that's great. But the reality is it had no impact on our overall performance, right? It was a headwind. It was dollars of headwind that we would like not to have had, but we powered through it as a company, right? We delivered above -- growth rates above our own internal expectations and certainly above what the external view was. So it's not an excuse. We talked about it purely as a clarifying comment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias representing UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Marc, just a question on the industrial segment. It looks like demand there is still strong, but obviously, the macro picture is mixed. So I guess what is the tone amongst customers when you speak to them about spending at this point? And generally speaking, where do you get the sense that they are in terms of their new product cycles?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of industrial and applied markets, as you mentioned, and we did well as -- it's a good quarter. We saw strong demand broadly across our businesses serving those markets. So as I mentioned, molecular spectroscopy was good. Process Instruments was good. Handheld instruments were good. Mass spec for those applications were strong. So very solid in terms of Q1. Customer feedback is good, as we said on our last call. Comps get a little tougher for us as the year unfolds. So that's something that we had in our original view on guidance, and that's a fact. But at least from a customer perspective, it looks pretty good.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And can you just update us on facility rationalizations? Do you think that the level of closures this year could be in the low-20s range that you've seen in the past? And maybe what portion of margin improvement this year might come from those efforts?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So as I said last quarter when I gave a lot more detail on our full year guidance, we're expecting about $50 million of benefit year-over-year from site closures. We initiated more than 20 last year. The number that will actually physically close this year, I don't have off the top of my head. And my guess is that it's between 15 and 20.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam representing Cantor Fitzgerald.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "So Marc, I think you mentioned pretty solid growth in Europe in the quarter. And could you maybe give us more color around what you saw by, I guess, the different end markets like industrial versus pharma, et cetera, and also kind of the outlook there for the remainder of the year?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. In terms of Europe, the performance in Q1 was actually pretty similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter in terms of the end markets. Geographically, Northern Europe stronger than Southern Europe. That's not a surprise. And we saw good strength in industrial customers across the continent from that perspective as well.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "Okay. And just a quick follow-up, going back to Phadia, so just a clarification there, the allergy business, you did not have any other allergy business before Phadia acquisition?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's correct.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And from the seasonality perspective, should we anticipate kind of this to be -- have a similar, I guess, lumpiness, if you will, that you might normally see in the flu business going forward? Is that fair to assume that?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when you look at the allergy business, basically the majority of the business is your normal allergy work with some seasonal allergies, really pollen related, around the world. The seasonal portion of the allergy business is a Q1, Q2 phenomenon. Typically, Japan is more of a Q1. Europe and the U.S. is typically more of a Q2. So it really just moves the incremental growth one way or the other. The base underlying business, the trends are very positive as allergy demand continues to be strong.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby representing Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Just wondering regarding the Lab Products and Services side, you did 4% organic growth this quarter. And I believe you're going against your most difficult comp, 2-year comp, in the first quarter. So I'm just wondering where you think -- and what you're thinking about organic growth over the remainder of the year in that business?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So as Marc said earlier about Specialty Diagnostics, we don't really like to get into giving guidance in terms of growth by segment. But we're happy with the 4% growth in the first quarter. We are expecting to continue to grow for the rest of the year probably low-single digits.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up, do you still expect 70 to 90 basis points of operating margin improvement this year?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, yes, that's not changed from the previous guidance.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight representing CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Marc, you had mentioned in the past, that in a normal economic time and governments send a [ph] funding act environment, you might be able to reach 5-ish percent on organic. Do you that's higher now if we do ever get back to a normalized period?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think everyone on this call has heard me say a number of times that Thermo Fisher is a solidly mid-single-digit organic growth company. I feel very confident about that because of our unique value proposition, our scale and depth of capabilities, our great and expanding presence in emerging markets and our incredible track record of innovation and a bright outlook for new products. So our job is to manage those mid-single-digit targets in various market conditions. It's not always possible every single quarter, especially if the world is difficult. But I'm pleased with how we did in Q1 from a revenue perspective. Obviously, if we get more tailwinds in a particular customer segment, it means that we're going to grow more, and we would be -- we'll be thrilled when that happens.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "And then I know you're -- part of your China strategy has been to expand manufacturing with Xuzhou happening this year. Does it stop there? Or does it just continue?", "Marc N. Casper", "Our perspective on manufacturing, the focus has actually shifted a little bit over the years. A lot of what we're doing in the region is actually for the local customer base now. So these are big facilities. But they're really fueling demand locally, which is good because it means you have better supply chain, lower cost, less duties, all of those things that actually make your economics better. So Xuzhou factory will be serving Lab Products broadly. It's a big facility with lots of room for expansion. So we don't have any plans for another factory after that. I think the next move is, as the growth continues, would be to expand that facility. That would be the next phase of growth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Daniel Leonard representing Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Just a couple of questions on guidance assumptions. Number one, can you remind us, for the Lab Products and Services business, are you expecting the operating margin to be flat, up or down in 2012? And what the drivers would be behind that?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So again, I don't want to get into specific guidance, but it should be -- I said last quarter, we're expecting margins to stabilize. That's happening. We were down 40 basis points, but we're up sequentially. So for the full year, I think flat margin is probably as good as an assumption as any.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up in terms of the academic and government markets being down low-single digits, are you assuming in your guidance that, that remains down low-single digits for the entirety of the year? Or would you expect there's some flattening on an easier comp in the back half of the year?", "Marc N. Casper", "So from a view -- and when we do our planning we don't measure every end market by every quarter, and we usually do it by business. We know that comparisons get easier as the year unfolds in academic and government, but we also know that customer uncertainty is likely to increase a little bit until the budget is resolved, which -- if it's going to get resolved is likely to happen late fourth quarter. So we're assuming that, for the full year, it's going to be down low-single digits. We're not making dramatic changes quarter-by-quarter on how that's going to play out.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Ferreiro representing Oppenheimer.", "David Ferreiro - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "Just a quick question for Pete. I think you mentioned this in your prepared remarks. But I wonder if you can reiterate that, just general pricing trends in the quarter, and then maybe an update on the outlook for the year.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So I didn't mention that in my comments. But we basically saw pricing similar to what we've been seeing for the last number of quarters, somewhere between 50 and 100 basis points. And our expectation is that's going to continue for the rest of the year, still more favorable pricing on consumables as opposed to equipment.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Derek De Vries representing Bank of America.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "The -- so just talking a little bit more about the competitive landscape, so 2 questions. Marc, you spent a lot of time and effort building out your Chinese facilities, and you're trying to build that out as a consumables market and doing it like that. Can you talk a little broadly about how your initial steps have been there? And I guess how big is that, when we think about the laboratory consumables market in China, in the APAC Region, how big is that? And the just give us some idea of the magnitude of that relative to North America markets? That's the first question, and I'll follow that up with something.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So the Lab Consumables opportunity is meaningful. Today, we have roughly a $600 million business in China. Probably 10% of that is Lab Consumables. And that could easily be triple that in terms of our opportunity over time. So -- and it's growing as well. So that's good growth opportunity for us.", "Derek De Vries - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. And could you talk about your successes and/or just your experiences now that you've acquired some of the realtime PCR assays. I think that was Fermentas, then -- and some of those products there. And there's obviously been some changes in the market there as patents have come off. Can you talk about your successes? Were -- are you making any inroads in the market there? What customers are trying your products, using that? Just a little bit more on that kind of competitive landscape in that market?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. Basically, we've launched a low-cost, high-performance instrument for qPCR. It came through an acquisition complement -- on the Instruments side complemented with other reagents from Fermentas. And we're targeting the areas where we, as a company, have tremendous strength, so things like the food testing market. Those labs are going to be the early adopters, and we'll work our way across the customer base. We'll be leveraging our channel to drive growth there. So it's early, and we're a small share player with those technologies. We didn't make a huge investment to get into that space, but we feel like we're well positioned to grow well.", "So let me wrap up. Let me add a couple of thoughts. First, we're pleased with our strong start to the year. Second, our growth investments are clearly paying off with a strong pipeline of new products and accelerated expansion in emerging markets. During the quarter, we continued our track record of delivering double-digit adjusted EPS growth, and that puts us in an excellent position to deliver our goals for 2012. ", "So thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. I look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Ms. Carol Cox, Vice President of Investor Relations. Carol, you may begin.", "Carol A. Cox", "Thank you, Ben, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies' Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our press release today at 1 p.m. Pacific Time or 4 p.m. Eastern Time, posted it on our website at lifetechnologies.com and also filed it on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, we also posted a deck of slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found on the Events and Presentations section of the Life Technologies Investor Relations website with our other earnings materials.", "Joining me on today's call are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; Ronnie Andrews, President of our Medical Sciences Division; and David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer, will also be available during the Q&A portion of today's call.", "If you've not received a copy of today's press release, you may obtain one from our website at lifetechnologies.com.", "I'd also like to remind everyone listening today that our discussions will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans, prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are detailed in the filings made by Life Technologies with the SEC. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the non-GAAP measures to GAAP may be found in today's press release or on our website.", "I will now hand the call over to Greg.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Thanks, Carol, and thank you to everyone joining us today as we provide an overview of our second quarter results and expectations for the second half of the year. As Carol mentioned, Ronnie Andrews will be on the call today to provide an update on our diagnostic strategy and details around our 2 recent tuck-in acquisitions in this very exciting area.", "We finished the first half of 2012 in line with our expectations as continued strength across several of our businesses contributed to results. Revenue for the quarter came in slightly higher than expected at $950 million, as increased sales in our BioProduction and Ion Torrent businesses drove results and enabled us to grow revenue by 1%, as reported in the second quarter, and a total of 5% if you exclude the nearly $40 million in headwinds from expected declines in the sales of our SOLiD 5500 product and qPCR royalties.", "We were able to expand our gross margin year-over-year to 65.4% and our operating margin by 80 basis points to 28.6%, which helped drive an 8% increase in non-GAAP earnings per share. Our EPS came in at $0.96.", "Overall, our end markets largely remained in line with our expectations. We saw strength in our emerging markets and in Asia Pacific, where we continue to expand our operations. In the U.S., we continued to see a cautious but stable environment.", "At the end of the second quarter, we did start to see a weakening in our Western European operations as customers became more cautious with their spending in the research market. Our 2012 growth expectations for the European region, which includes all of the Europe and emerging markets in Russia, the Middle East and South Africa, have been in the low single digits. For the first half of 2012, we recorded growth in this range, driven by strength in our BioProduction and Forensics businesses, which was partially offset by slower growth in our Research Consumables business.", "As we look to the second half of the year, we are still calling for growth, but take a more conservative outlook and now expect overall growth in the Europe at the low end of our range, closer to 1%.", "Our emerging markets continue to perform extremely well. A year ago, we saw a temporary slowdown in Greater China as we moved to enhance our dealer model and supplement it with our own sales force. Through our efforts over the last 12 months, we have normalized operations in Greater China and are seeing consistent growth in the high teens on a percentage basis.", "During the second quarter, we completed the acquisition of Beijing Maojian United Star Technology Company, a Life distributor covering mainly the Invitrogen brand reagent portfolio in Beijing and the rest of North China. This acquisition now creates one of the largest direct selling forces in the life sciences reagents market in China and further optimizes our channel in the region.", "In addition to finding ways to expand our market opportunities, we are also finding better ways to improve our customer experience, increase our productivity and lower our costs. Asia Pacific is one of our fastest-growing geographies, and with this growth, our volume of items shipped per day in the region has increased fourfold over the last 2 years. To address this increasing demand, we are further expanding our distribution centers in both Singapore and China. We are also expanding our manufacturing center of excellence in Singapore to provide our global customers innovative technologies more efficiently while helping them advance their research even faster. The center will design and manufacture Life products, including Ion next-generation sequencing and molecular diagnostic instruments for thousands of customers within the region and outside Asia Pacific. The facility expansion is taking this total square footage up from 75,000 to 133,000 square feet. We're already beginning to see the benefit of producing products internally with higher margins and faster turnaround for our customers. It also has added the benefit of providing further tax efficiencies.", "During the quarter, we continued to deliver on our innovation pipeline, launching new Ion AmpliSeq clinical research products for cancer and inherited disease and expanding our capabilities to commercialize novel stem cell technologies.", "We also continue to make progress with our new QuantStudio instrument, shipping a record number of units in the quarter. QuantStudio does more than just genotyping. It does gene expression, genotyping and digital PCR and is taking share from genotyping and gene expression arrays. It combines flexible throughput capabilities with a streamlined workflow. The QuantStudio 12K Flex system takes customers from targeted discovery through confirmation and screening, all on a single platform. In fact, we are seeing an increasing number of open array technology applications that are cannibalizing the current genotyping array business.", "Additionally, we continue to make compelling progress in throughput, read-lengths and data quality for our Ion PGM benchtop sequencer. In its first year, Ion Torrent doubled read-length to 200 bases and increased throughput one hundred fold to 1 gigabase. In the second quarter, we released new 200-base kits and upgraded the Torrent Suite 2.2 data analysis software, which further scales throughput and improves data quality to the Q30 quality level. We also released data sets demonstrating 400-base read-length with data quality sustained at the Q30 level across the long reads, which we intend to launch in the second half of this year. These performance improvements spurred the development of new applications that can be run on the Ion PGM sequencers at basic and clinical research labs all over the world.", "We also reached 2 important milestones in the quarter. First, we have increased our membership to  10,000 in our Ion Community, actively sharing methods, data and applications. Second, we have now installed well over 1,000 Ion PGM sequencers in labs around the world, making Ion Torrent the leading next-generation benchtop sequencer.", "In the second quarter, we continued to see strong demand for the PGM instrument and our associated consumables. We saw significant year-over-year growth in the PGM platform as we continued to enjoy strong, competitive positioning and high demand from customers.", "I also have some updates related to the Proton. We are currently running exomes on the Proton I Chip and began sharing data sets with customers in July. We are very pleased with the progress we have made and expect to make continued improvements similar to our experience with PGM chips.", "You may recall when we launched the first 314 chip, we were seeing 10 megabases of throughput. Now 18 months later, we've iterated on the technology and improved throughput on the 314 chip to 100 megabases. Nothing gets better faster than our semiconductor technology.", "We're now on track to begin shipping the Proton instrument that will run the Proton I Chip in September, well within our internal time line. We have over 100 orders already in the queue and continue to take additional orders. Our expectation is that we will ship a substantial number of units in the third quarter as we continue to ramp production and expect to ship further backlog in the fourth quarter. We are extremely pleased with the customer interest and demand for Proton so far.", "Earlier today, we announced that the New York Genome Center had purchased 4 Ion Proton sequencers for its new Innovation Center. We are pleased that the New York Genome Center has joined the growing list of prestigious research-focused hospitals and institutions around the world that are rapidly adopting our Ion technology. The units will be housed at the IFM Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and used to accelerate its research on the genetic mechanisms of cancer.", "The feedback from our customers is that Proton will be a game changer in research because it will be able to sequence runs in as little as 90 minutes. Currently, the research market focuses on work with exomes, while the diagnostic testing market is using gene panels. We're addressing the clinical markets with the PGM and are planning on submitting a 510(k) with the FDA.", "Next, in September, we'll be hosting a scientific forum to speak about the benefits of Ion semiconductor sequencing and its multiple applications. At the forum, we will be featuring our PGM and Proton products and hosting speakers and scientific coacher sessions to highlight cutting-edge research across the full landscape of genomics research. We will also feature the use of PGM system to advance clinical research, and we expect customers to present the Proton data at that meeting.", "During the quarter, our businesses continued to generate very strong free cash flow of $232 million, and we remain on track to deliver $650 million to $675 million free cash flow for the year.", "As I've been saying all year, our management team and Board of Directors remains committed to a balanced approach to deploying capital, and we continue to review all options of how best to do so.", "During the second quarter and through July, we spent an additional $150 million to repurchase shares to bring our year-to-date total spend on share repurchases to $335 million. We are enhancing our commitment to returning capital to shareholders as evidenced by our announcement today that our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $750 million-share repurchase program. We expect to execute against this new authorization beginning in the second half of 2012.", "The market dynamics we saw in the first half of 2012 were largely in line with our expectations. As we now look to the second half of the year, we have dynamics that are causing us to take an incrementally more conservative outlook. Currency has become more of headwind as the euro has weakened significantly since the beginning of the year. And the macro outlook for most of Europe continues to worsen. Additionally, while we've not seen any further slowdown than expected in research spend from our NIH-funded customers, we are watching the situation very closely. We read the same sequestration and budget cut [ph] headlines that all of you and our customers are reading, and we are monitoring for any potential holdback in spending.", "With these factors in mind, as well as our recent Medical Sciences acquisitions, we are revising our guidance. We are now expecting our organic revenue growth to be at the low end of the 2 to 4 percentage range we have provided, really closer to 2%. We're also lowering the top end of our non-EPS by $0.05 and are now expecting earnings per share in the range of $3.90 to $4 a share.", "We believe that we have made the necessary adjustments to our guidance to best reflect the macro factors as well as those that are specific to Life. We have already pulled back in some areas on discretionary spending and will continue to monitor our end markets and developments in Washington. If we see any deterioration in the current trends, we're prepared to take additional actions to quickly preserve profitability.", "We understand that these are uncertain times, and we're doing our best to weather a challenging environment in the near term. However, we are committed to diversifying our exposure and leveraging our life science expertise across geographies and into growth areas like next-generation sequencing and Medical Sciences. We are continuing to make the investments we believe are necessary to make us increasingly more competitive and healthy in 2013 and 2014 and the years beyond.", "With that, I will turn the call over to Ronnie to provide an overview of our Medical Sciences strategy.", "Ronnie Andrews", "Thanks, Greg. I appreciate the opportunity to join today's call to provide an update on our Medical Sciences strategy and to speak about our recent efforts to build our offerings and assets in the diagnostics area.", "Since I joined Life in late February, we've been moving very rapidly to develop our strategy and begin engaging companies and potential partners to create organizational velocity. We made terrific progress in establishing a plan that will capitalize on Life's deep base of technology and become a solid growth engine for the company, as well as ensuring we are good stewards by focusing on partnerships and tuck-ins where possible, versus larger, more capital-intensive acquisitions. To date, we've been able to attract strong talent from the molecular diagnostics industry to bolster our commercial operations and our regulatory efforts, and we combine with the team that's already in place. We're well on our way to having one of the strongest teams in the industry.", "For those of you who know me, you know how passionate I am about the opportunities that lie ahead of us in molecular medicine. I truly believe we're at a major inflection point in the way we manage complex disease. And with the breath of Life's technology portfolio, I'm confident we can play a major role in democratizing disease-changing diagnostic information to clinicians around the world.", "Our vision for Medical Sciences business is to become the most relevant provider of high-value information to assist physicians in the management of complex diseases. Diseases such as cancer require the assimilation and synthesis of vast amounts of diagnostic data. And we're excited to be expanding our product offering into the area of informatics and testing services that will allow community-based physicians to have access to information and expert consultation when they need it.", "Over time, we plan to offer a full range of products to diagnose, aid in therapy selection and treat and monitor these complex diseases. We intend to leverage Life's tremendous instrument install base with over 7,500 placements of Genetic Analysis platforms in clinical settings today, that enable hospitals and reference labs to provide important information to their physician communities. The important point here, though, is that our placements span across our CE, qPCR, SOLiD, FISH, immunohistochemistry and Ion PGM technologies and platforms. Life's global channel access is a powerful advantage as we build out our molecular diagnostics business.", "Our technology breadth well positions us to support assay development and information synthesis in 5 key areas where we believe we can create value: oncology, inherited disease, neurological disorders, transplant diagnostics and infectious diseases. Our future lies in bringing value to the physician-patient interface by delivering disease management information to the treating physician, information generated by our portfolio of products and synthesized through our bioinformatics engine and then distributed via an industry-leading physician portal.", "Over the last several weeks, you've seen a series of announcements from us on partnerships and acquisitions related to our diagnostics effort in the verticals of inherited disease and oncology. In June, we announced that we're collaborating with 2 premiere research institutes, The Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto and Boston Children's Hospital, both of which will start to adopt the Ion Proton platform as their choice of sequencing technology as they study inherited diseases. Under these collaborations, the institutions will use the Ion Torrent platform to develop next-generation sequencer applications for clinical research in pediatric diseases. We then gain the rights to share the tools, the methods and the protocols that result from these collaborations via kits and consultation with other customers, to accelerate adoption and to add value to the Ion platform for our users.", "Over the last 30 days, we've made significant progress in building out our diagnostics franchise with the tuck-in acquisitions of Navigenics and Pinpoint Genomics, which together will allow us to offer a lung cancer molecular subclassification test to the pathology and oncology community via a powerful physician portal.", "Navigenics brings us an established, CLIA-certified laboratory licensed throughout the U.S. This asset will play a central role in delivering our diagnostics model in following ways: the CLIA-certified lab will be used for design and validation of new, high-value and high-impact diagnostic assays and to offer proprietary applications that address current unmet needs in the management of complex diseases like cancer.", "Our CLIA lab is a means to an end, not an end to itself. The goal is to take panels and products developed here and utilize the lab to gain standard of care for the proprietary tests while we take the tests through the regulatory processes, so we can ultimately democratize the labs globally.  Navigenics' software infrastructure assets will also allow us to accelerate development of medical informatics solutions to enable data capture, clinical annotation and physician interpretation. Finally, we intend to continue to build partnerships with pharmaceutical companies for companion diagnostic development, including participating in early-phase clinical trials, all of which is enabled by our CLIA lab acquisition.", "We also acquired Pinpoint Genomics, which has an early-stage non-small cell lung cancer test that can help doctors identify and treat those early-stage patients at risk for progression to late-stage disease, who today are not typically given follow-on treatment post surgery. Although medical research has realized impressive gains against many forms of cancer, the survival rate for lung cancer has not changed in 30 years with nearly half of the early-stage patients not surviving beyond 5 years. Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide, claiming close to 1.5 million lives each year. Clearly, this disease could benefit from better differential diagnosis and more efficient treatment protocols.", "The Pinpoint lung cancer test is designed to the detect micro metastases, a predictor of disease progression in early-stage lung cancer patients. The 14-gene panel was validated using 2 independent, blinded, retrospective studies of approximately 1,500 patients, a significantly powered study compared to the studies used to launch other proprietary diagnostic tests that are available in other cancer areas today. By ordering the Pinpoint test, doctors will be able to identify which patients have a high chance of recurrence and treat them more aggressively.", "Another important point to note is that the Pinpoint gene panel was developed on a live qPCR platform. And therefore, to be transitioned from a CLIA LDT to an IVD CE-marked kit. We plan to launch the test commercially later in 2012 as an LDT to ensure that lung cancer patients, who today worry about their risk for recurrence, will now have access to information that will help them and their physician make an informed choice about the need for adjuvant therapy. We will begin immediately, though, to work on transitioning the test to a kit-based offering, which we will launch through our global channel, allowing us to access our large installed base of qPCR platforms currently being used in clinical labs outside the U.S. today.", "The addition of the Pinpoint test is a great start as we move into the world of targeted molecular diagnostics. It aligns extremely well with Life's goal of providing relevant information to treating physicians for the management of complex diseases and takes advantage of the industry-leading qPCR platform placements. In addition, with the emergence of the Ion PGM Dx for next-generation sequencing, that's a technology ready for clinical development, we will stand alone in our industry as a company that can empower labs with content and platforms across the genome, transcriptome and proteome.", "While we're still in the early stages of building out this business, we're very encouraged with the progress we've made in such a short time. I look forward to updating you as the strategy continues to unfold. And with that, I'll turn the call over to David to provide a more detailed overview of our results and our guidance for 2012. David?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Ronnie. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the second quarter and a more detailed commentary around our expectations for the third quarter and full year.", "For the first half of the year, we delivered revenue and earnings growth that was in line with our expectations. Our second quarter revenues grew 1% to $950 million, slightly ahead of our guidance of flat revenue growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.96, an increase of 8% over prior year, and included a $0.02 impact from lower foreign exchange rates compared to rates at the end of March. Free cash flow for the quarter totaled $232 million.", "Before I move into a more detailed review of the quarter, I would like to remind everyone of the headwinds impacting our results this year. While we've been talking about these items for some time, I thought it would be useful to size the specific impact they had in the second quarter.", "As Greg mentioned, they include $30 million in lower SOLiD instrument sales, and a decline of about $8 million in our qPCR royalty revenues. If we exclude the impact of these 2 items, our revenue growth was 5%.", "As you recall, we also talked about lower stimulus revenues in the United States, which we've estimated to be about $10 million per quarter. Excluding the stimulus impact, we'd add another 1% to our growth.", "Now let me turn to the details -- the detailed results for the quarter. For our geographic regions, revenue, excluding currency, was as follows: the Americas declined 2%, Europe grew 1%, Asia Pacific grew 17%, and Japan declined 6%.", "The decline in SOLiD sales affected all regions, while the qPCR royalty decline is booked only in the Americas. If we back out the impact from SOLiD and the qPCR royalty decline, growth is in line with our expectations and is more representative of the performance of our underlying business. With these adjustments, the Americas grew 2%, Europe grew 4%, Asia Pacific grew 19% and Japan grew 2%.", "As Greg had mentioned, we are seeing a slower pace of growth in Europe, primarily Western Europe, but in the second quarter, we experienced good growth in Russia as well as in countries in Southern Europe, primarily due to the timing of some larger deals.", "Taking a closer look at our business groups for results for the quarter. Excluding currency, Research Consumables revenue increased 1% to  $403 million over the same period last year. We continue to see growth in our cell culture products, benchtop instruments and selected Molecular Biology consumables product lines. Revenue for Genetic Analysis decreased 6% to $353 million for the second quarter compared to prior year. The decline was primarily due to the expected headwind from SOLiD and the qPCR royalties, offset by the growth of Ion Torrent. Genetic Analysis growth, excluding the SOLiD and qPCR royalty revenue headwinds, would have been 5%. Applied Sciences revenue increased 15% to $194 million for the second quarter compared to prior year. The increase was driven primarily by BioProduction and Forensics and resulted from strong demand and the timing of orders.", "Gross margin increased 120 basis points to 65.4% compared to prior year, driven by lower SOLiD instrument sales, a positive benefit from the roll-off of our 2011 currency hedges, partially offset by the decline in qPCR royalties. On a sequential basis, gross margin decreased by approximately 120 basis points. We expected some decline as a result of increased sales of Ion Torrent, but we also had higher sales of BioProduction, which carry a lower margin than the corporate average, and the overall drop in exchange rates also contributed to the decline.", "As expected, our operating expenses of $350 million were higher on a year-over-year basis, principally due to our annual merit increase that took effect in April and our continued investments in Greater China and Ion Torrent. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up, as expected, primarily due to the annual merit increase.", "Our operating profit totaled $271 million, an increase of 3% over prior year. Second quarter operating margin was 28.6%, representing an increase of 80 basis points. The increase over the prior year was a result of better gross margins, partially offset by higher operating expenses.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $500,000 of interest income, a loss of $2.6 million from foreign exchange and other items and interest expense of $29 million.", "Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.6%, slightly better than our expectations. Compared to the same quarter of last year, the rate was lower due to increased domestic manufacturing incentives and greater foreign tax credits on repatriated earnings.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 181.3 million, a decrease of 3.5 million over the prior year as we continued to repurchase shares.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and the cash flow statements. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $303 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $264 million. Cash from operating activities was $256 million, capital expenditures were $24 million and free cash flow was $232 million.", "Return on invested capital was 9% for the quarter, which is basically in line with our cost of capital. Given the greater currency headwinds and the lower top line growth expectations, we do not anticipate reaching our 10% target by the end of 2012.", "However, we remain committed to this goal, and we are working to achieve it as quickly as possible.", "Our ending debt as of June 30 was approximately $2.4 billion. This balance is made up of our senior notes of $2.3 billion plus some short-term debt.", "Now let me take a moment and talk about our outlook for the remainder of 2012 and provide guidance for the third quarter.", "We expect our full year organic revenue growth to be at the low end of the 2% to 4% range, which we had originally guided to, primarily due to slower growth in Europe. We are maintaining the bottom end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance, but lowering the top end by $0.05, and are now expecting our non-GAAP EPS to be in the range of $3.90 to $4. We estimate that incremental currency headwinds since our full year guidance in February are likely to lower EPS by a net $0.03 for the full year. Our recent Medical Science acquisitions will be $0.02 dilutive, and the lower organic revenue outlook will also impact EPS.", "We intend to offset a portion of these factors through a reduction in discretionary spending. We're also anticipating reduced shares outstanding resulting from our share repurchases and expect to benefit from a slightly lower tax rate.", "For the full year, we are expecting our share count to be in the range of 180 million to 182 million and our tax rate to be at 27.5%, assuming extension of the R&D tax credit in Q4.", "We're now expecting our operating margin expansion to be in the range of 25 to 50 basis points compared with our previous expectations for an expansion of 50 to 100 basis points, primarily driven by product mix, including a higher portion of BioProduction, and Ion instrument sales, weakened foreign exchange rates and a slightly lower revenue outlook.", "Moving on to currency. Recall that our original 2012 guidance for currency was at December month-end rates, which, net of the hedge roll-off benefit, was a headwind of $26 million to revenue and a benefit of $0.02 to EPS. At June month-end rates, currency, net of the hedge roll-off, had a negative $41 million impact on revenue and a negative impact to our EPS of $0.01 for the full year, resulting in a net headwind of $0.03 for the full year.", "When we look at the second half of the year based on June month-end rates, we are now expecting a year-on-year EPS headwind from currency only of $0.18 for the second half of 2012, which is $0.06 worse than the impact we guided to using December month-end rates.", "Now let me provide some color for the second half of the year. We expect the fourth quarter to have higher revenue and earnings than our third quarter as we experience a normal ramp due to customer buying patterns, increased sales of our Ion Torrent platform and shift a large Applied Sciences deal that we had originally planned to close in Q3 to Q4.", "In addition, as you may remember, we also had a large Forensics sale in Russia in Q3 of last year, which we're not expecting to repeat this year.", "For the third quarter, we expect revenue, including currency at June month-end rates, to be in the range of $900 million to $910 million. Gross margins are expected to be down year-over-year, largely due to a decline in foreign exchange rates, increased sales of Ion Torrent and the previously discussed decline in qPCR royalty revenues.", "Our operating expenses are expected to be flat year-over-year as the impact of the merit increase is offset by a reduction in discretionary spending. We expect operating expenses to be down sequentially as we prioritize spending while continuing to invest in strategic areas. Because of these dynamics and with currency at June month-end rates, we're expecting Q3 EPS to be in a range of $0.87 to $0.90.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Carol.", "Carol A. Cox", "Thank you, David. We'll now turn the call open to Q&A. And I'd just like to remind everyone again, if possible, if you could limit yourself to one question and possibly one follow-up since we have  multiple analysts to get through. Ben, if you could open up, please?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie Capital.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So Greg, if I can just start off kind of with the bigger question. You've shown in this quarter again just how stable, kind of steady the business is, and you generated over $200 million free cash. And so one of the big areas that investors have been focused on is on the kind of returning cash to shareholders, and you have this commitment in the presentation to return 50% of free cash to shareholders. I know you've talked in the past about potentially doing a dividend versus a buyback. Can you maybe just talk about kind of how the board came to the decision of doing the buyback and the timing you expect to executing against that buyback?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Certainly. So the first part of the question, the board deliberated on what was the best way to deploy capital back to shareholders at this point and, as you can see, decided on a fairly large share buyback. It, in their mind, is not an either/or in terms of a buyback or a dividend. In fact, I think once the tax policy is more clear, that the board will deliberate again if it should augment it's deployment of cash to shareholders with a dividend as well. So that remains an option. It's just not an option until we're further understanding what the tax policies will be on this treatment. In terms of the timing, what we're willing to say at this point is that we're going to start buying our shares back here immediately in the second half the year. And I think, as you've seen us do in the first half, we're going to be fairly aggressive about it given the, we think, fairly depressed price of the shares today. So that's our plan.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay, great. And if I can just follow up. Obviously, you made some good comments there, some updates on Proton. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the order book? You gave some numbers. Or maybe just kind of give us an update of your overall view of how Proton is tracking, how the order book is tracking relative to your expectations and just kind of your general update on that relative to kind of what you're thinking about internally.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. So I'll answer those a little bit, and then I'll also turn over to Mark. But as we said in the script, we have over 100 orders of Proton already, and we'll begin shipping those in September. Like we had with the PGM, when it gets launched, there will be a fast iteration process with those clients to make it just that much more of a compelling instrument. And we see a similar ramp of the capability of that technology of Proton just like we saw with PGM. So we're very enthusiastic and very bullish. I would say what's really attracting the interest of clients, and we're just at the very beginning of it, is here you have an instrument that essentially spans the whole range of possibility. It can be the instrument for a high-throughput genomic center, as the New York Genome Center is looking at, or it can also scale down if the case is. And it's all done for a very economical price. So we think it's an absolute game-changer instrument, and I think that's why customers, sight unseen essentially, are beginning to buy, and soon they'll see it. So Mark, any other comments?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "I would just to add, Jon, I think the customers see the vision of where semiconductor technology has gone. I mean, if you just take one aspect like read length that we've demonstrated on the PGM and going from 100 read to now shipping 200 read, this quarter, we're shipping 300 base pair reads, and in Q4 we're launching the 400 base pair, they just see the scalability very quickly of this technology, and that's what customers are really buying into here.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I wanted to just start with the third quarter guidance, especially the top line. Can you just walk us through the moving parts for the third quarter versus the fourth? The third quarter comes in a little bit lighter than we were expecting on the top line. So can you just walk us through the issues in the third quarter and how they tied to the guidance?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Let me start with that one. And I wouldn't say there are issues in the third quarter. The third quarter basically reflects -- if you look back historically, it's been one of our lighter quarters. Academic and universities are off and purchasing tends to be lighter. We didn't see a ramp-up in the fourth quarter, and we expect that, that will be the case here. Second is Ion Torrent. As Greg said, we're launching it in September. So we'll get some sales in the third quarter, in the final month, but it will be running full speed for the fourth quarter. Those are the primary drivers. In addition, as I mentioned in my script, we've got a couple of larger deals in the Applied Sciences, which we're expecting in the last half of the year. We thought one of them would happen in the third quarter and now looks like that's more likely to happen in the fourth. Could still happen in the third, but we think it's going to be in the fourth. And so just to be conservative, we have assumed it'll be at the end of the year. Those are the 3 primary drivers.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And can you just quantify that -- the size of that large deal? And my follow-up relates to the industrial and Applied end markets. Several companies have talked about slowdowns kind of late in the quarter. Can you give us your perspective with a -- with some discussion on the geographic mix of the industrial and Applied end markets?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "We -- maybe I'll take the latter part. Just in terms of -- when you say industrial, I presume you mean pharmaceutical. Is that what your question is?", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "No, not exactly. I mean, more of the Applied end markets where you're talking about food, environmental. That's what I'm talking about more.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, for us, the food testing business, the animal herd testing business, our Forensics business, BioProduction continue to be extremely robust. So we haven't seen that. And then you asked a question about the size of the deal. It's -- we expect it to be in the $5 million to $10 million range.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Just wondering on the expense side of things. You talked about being a little bit more prudent in this environment. We've seen some of your peers maybe move toward more cost-containment and cost-cutting actions. Can you talk a little bit about how we can think about leverage on the expense side? And particularly, I'm wondering on R&D. As you're moving more into diagnostics and layering on additional content, can we expect to see some R&D leverage either in the back half of this year or at some point in 2013?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "And Tycho, maybe just to clarify. When you say R&D leverage, what is that lingo for?", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Well, just kind of trying to bring down your overall R&D spend. I mean, I guess, yes, I mean, the question is, as you move more into diagnostics, do you have to spend a lot more to validate the additional tests you're bringing on? Or is there an opportunity, more broadly speaking, to control your R&D burn a little bit more in light of the current environment?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I would answer the question more broadly. We don't necessarily focus in our cost controls on any one particular line item. By virtue of our outcomes over the last few years, you can see how we've really driven margins higher by focusing in on everything. And so as we look to the second half and beyond, if we face into further headwinds, we have a number of different projects teed up, different ideas teed up where we can, we think, control our expenses, not necessarily in the R&D line alone but in -- across really the spend that we have in the company.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, and just to piggyback on that, you -- and I think you've seen that our R&D came down as a percentage of sales from 10-plus percent over the last couple of years to closer to 9% we're targeting this year. And if we need to, we'll take a look at, as Greg said, all aspects of our spending and make sure that we preserve profitability.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "If I can just add, too, as you think about -- Tycho, as you think about medical sciences and how we build out our program, traditionally, at least in my past, we have used what I would call sponsored R&D agreements with pharmaceutical companies and other biotech partners so that they actually would pay us to do a lot of the research and platform development work for them. So I expect that we can be extremely prudent users of R&D dollars to get the maximum benefit for us in terms of validation of these targeted assays that we're working on.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just to be clear on the guidance for the back half of the year, I mean, obviously, you're bringing it down in terms of the incremental caution on Europe. And the 3 things that we should think about are Proton, the Applied Science deal. And then you commented on the year-end budget flush. I just want to delve in on that specifically in light of sequestration. Are you still envisioning that we get a big budget flush in the academic side in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "No, it was less -- I was less commenting on a big budget flush and more on that our third quarter tends to be a lower quarter in terms of sales. You didn't see so much of that last year because we happened to have a big Forensics deal in Russia in the third quarter of last year, which was $9 million. But normally, we have a dip down from Q2 to Q3 and then back up in Q4. So we're not expecting a big flush in Q4.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. So it's really Proton and the Applied Science deal that gives you confidence that there is an acceleration in organic growth in the back half of the year even with the revised expectations?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Correct.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So the -- if you kind of look at the Research Consumables business, I mean, for the -- basically for the last 10 -- for the last 8 quarters or so -- it's -- so not 8 quarters, but last 6 quarters or so, it's been hovering kind of like the 1 percentage range like there. I mean, what do you think it's going to take to kind of reaccelerate that back? Is that purely in volume in terms of people at the bench doing experiments? I mean, what kind of reaccelerates back to like sort of what you saw like in 2010 where it was hovering more in the 5% range?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, Derik, I think our strategy is that it would be a combination of factors. One would obviously be exogenous tests, which would be more money coming into research spend. I think that's possible because we're at pretty low historical levels. But that's not what we're counting on. The way we believe we'll get faster growth is through market share. While other companies are perhaps less committed into that space, we're more committed. And I think we have a number of different initiatives under way to hopefully grow our share of the labs. When we've looked at not only our share, but our share in various niches, if you will, of research, there's still a lot of market share to be grown by us relative to others, and that's really our primary focus.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So in order to capture that incremental share, how much more SG&A muscle do you need to be put behind that? I mean, historically, if we go back, I mean, looked at the 2006 time frame and kind of how you've jiggered the sales force and did some changes, things like that, in terms to get the right products like that, is it more of getting them to sell more? Or is it putting more feet on the street to try and help drive that? I mean, how do you capture more share in that area?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, we're not going to lay out the playbook here on a public call. But I think you've made a presumption that we don't make, which is that it's going to require a substantially different vector in terms of the SG&A spend. In fact, as we look at what's happening, more and more is going to the web, to the eBusiness channels, and that's a very low-cost way for us to participate. So that's an example of where the economics of the business are changing in a favorable way and in a favorable way to consolidate our research tools like us. So that's one of the strategies, obviously, that is being employed. There are many others, but again, when we look at what it takes to grow share and also live to the commitment of expanding our operating margins, we think they're both very doable.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "On the Proton shipments in Q3, are there any revenue recognition items [ph] we should be aware of? Would you expect any meaningful lag between shipment and revenue recognition on those instruments?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "We don't expect any issues at this point. We had no problems with the introduction of the PGM. We just recently introduced the QuantStudio. We've got a big technical service group that is poised and ready to help us install the current sizable backlog that we have.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then my follow-up on guidance, David. For the third quarter, can you give us what your organic revenue growth assumption is in guidance given the fluctuations in currency? It's a little challenging to tease out. And then also, on share count, it seems if you were aggressive on the buyback program, you could get the share count well below 180 million for the year.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Let me just -- and so let me take -- the first question, let me just pull out some backup and I can give you that. Your second part of the question was on the share count?", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Yes. And if you were aggressive with the $750 million in share repurchase authorization, in -- at least the math I'm doing gets me below 180 million, and I'm wondering if I'm missing something.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, I think it all depends on how much you assume we'd purchase in the second half of the year, what you think the price is going to be, how many option exercises there are, et cetera. So our best guess at this point is the range is 180 million to 182 million. And if it significantly changes, we'll provide an update, and we'll certainly provide an update at the end of Q3.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "In investor meetings over the course of the second quarter, you were pretty positive about your outlook. I just want to try to get at kind of how the cadence of the quarter played out. And specifically, did things just at the end of the quarter maybe not come together in the way that you expected? And accordingly, did that change your view in a way that maybe at the beginning of June, you would have said you hadn't expected?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "So Doug, I think that what we saw at the end of the quarter, as I said that we think we said in the script, is that we saw some slight weakening in Research Consumables. On the instruments side, we have -- a significant amount of our instruments are sold late in the quarter. So I think as we were going through the quarter, we saw pretty stable conditions, and we saw a slight slowdown at the very end of the quarter, the final 2 weeks. We didn't see any big drop-off. And when I say a slowdown, there was a slow down in Europe. There's no cliff that we're looking at here. We don't anticipate any substantial change in the second half of the year. But we're just trying to be prudent and conservative in adjusting our outlook on the basis of that.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe building off of that, clearly a few moving parts in guidance. And without having precise FX and M&A assumptions by quarter, it's tough to get exactly at what you guys are looking for organically in Q3 and Q4. But I guess one thing I came up with suggests that you're guiding Q3 organic to something like 0% to 1%. And if that is the case, to get to full year guidance, I think that means organic growth needs to accelerate to something like 4% in the fourth quarter. Does this sound like it's in the right neighborhood? And if so, given that I believe Q4 is actually your toughest quarterly comp of the year, is that all predicated on what you talked about in terms of that Applied Science order and, I guess, Proton strength?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, those numbers that you've got in terms of the organic growth are in the ballpark. And, yes, that's the primary driver of the growth rate in the fourth quarter. It's the continued growth in PGM, a ramp-up at Proton and Applied Sciences orders.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I guess just one last one. You called out the headwinds associated with royalties and SOLiD. I believe one positive offset to those in the quarter was that you actually had a favorable comparison in China, or I guess I should say Greater China, where I believe you came up something like $20 million short of expectations in Q2 2010. Should investors also be adjusting the trends for that positive comparison in assessing the quality of this quarter and the run rate? And I guess specific to Greater China, how should investors think about the outlook from here given what was actually a favorable comp in the quarter?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, that -- you're absolutely right. And Q2 of last year was the time that we announced that we were moving to a new distribution strategy in China, but we were consolidating or -- our distributors and going direct. And Greg mentioned the purchase of one of our largest distributors in this quarter is evidence of that. It's working extremely well. Our growth rate's back in Greater China now are back to the high teens and 20s. And so that was -- of the things that happened to us in the second quarter, that is the one item that you could say is a onetime occurrence. And I believe the impact on the growth rate was somewhere about 1% to 2%. And so if you wanted, you could take all of the adjustments that we would have in terms of our headwinds in the second quarter of this year of -- with a growth rate of 6% and take off 1% to 2% to get a look at what the underlying growth rate is.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Ferreiro from Oppenheimer.", "David Ferreiro - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "My question is on PCR market dynamics. I was wondering if you guys could talk about the defensibility of your franchise and how market share has helped with the interest of other competitors over the past few years. And then finally, what impact discounting from your competition has had on the business in that time frame.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, David, it's Mark. I'll focus mainly on qPCR. We also have -- of course have a very competitive PCR market, and we've learned how to compete in that market when patents went off nearly 10 years ago now. A similar situation in qPCR. We've had a very competitive instrument market for a long period of time and continue to compete in that. We have the same really in the follow-through reagents. There's always been a competitive aftermarket that the groups that have made oligos and compete in the assays. Really, where our differentiation is, is, one, we offer choice in points for our customers across that range, whether it be lower [ph] instruments all the way up to the newly introduced QuantStudio for different experiments. We do the same in reagents. So we have choice points of chemistries across TaqMan and [indiscernible] allow different price points and formats for customers to do that, which allows us to compete. And then finally, we have a very strong support infrastructure for those customers doing those experiments. So for the assays we've built out a very strong franchise around all the available gene expression, MicroRNA steps. And that allows customers to race [ph] and to go on to our website and order those as predesigned assays. And when a lot of customers come to view those experiments, they have a lot variables in it, so they want to go to a trusted source. And that's really a lot that's defensible and is very sticky business in that nature.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "And I'd also like that more of our placements, a ratio [ph] of cells really play out in the diagnostics space. Once a lab brings up a qPCR product and is managing patients with that product, it's very difficult to change out that system or that reagent system due to the trending of patients, et cetera. So, I mean, we do have a number of instruments, as we've said, over 75 replacements in the clinical space. And so along with the other things that Mark said, that is a really great -- a strong opportunity for us to maintain our current share and maybe even grow it as we go forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "First off, just on the European weakness that you saw in the quarter, could you provide some detail regarding specifically like what parts of the business customers saw the weakness in Europe and what your new guidance reflects for these businesses in the back half of the year?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Let me start, and Mark, Greg, Ronnie can jump in. In terms of the weakness that we saw in Europe, again it's primarily in Western Europe, but we were surprisingly strong in the Southern parts of Europe largely due to some large orders that we had. The weakness was primarily in Research Consumables. And it was concentrated in the research market, some of which was in some of our larger pharma accounts and some in academic institutions. Again, in terms of what we're looking at going forward, it's not any substantial change in our outlook for Europe. It's just the range that we gave for organic growth in Europe was low single digits. And what we're looking at now is probably closer to 1%, 1.5%. So within that range, just at the lower end.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And then in terms of, well, maybe discretionary spending cuts, which you mentioned are helping to cushion or protect some of their earnings in the back of the year, could you just quantify to what extent the spending reductions are occurring that are aiding earnings in the back half of the year? And any detail you can provide about the additional flexibility you might have if things -- if the environment continues to stay depressed?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "We really haven't quantified those at this point in time. We're still working through the plans. We've got a level of different plans that start with things that are fairly easy to do, such as just monitoring travel and entertainment more closely outside services, those types of things, to some of the more fundamental things that we talked about earlier on in response to a question in the call, is some more fundamental organizational changes, some changes in the prioritization of our R&D programs, et cetera. And so what we're trying to do here is -- in an uncertain situation like this is remain flexible. We're committed to preserving profitability and hitting the guidance that we've provided and -- while, at the same time, trying to invest as much as we can in the future growth of the business. And we'll adjust the actions that we take in the second half of the year as it unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Michael Cherny from ISR.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "It's Ross. So I guess in thinking about the sort of diagnostic strategy, I guess in terms of magnitude and sort of what -- how you'd like to see this develop in the business and how you're thinking about it in the context of your sort of ROIC goals, we've seen a lot of companies move into the space. It's not necessarily been additive from a return perspective, although it's aided growth. How do you sort of look at the sort of puts and takes on that in the short term relative to some of the other targets you've laid out?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Ross, this is Greg. I think actually, the path we're pursuing so far is a nice balance between being able to continue to drive ROIC higher and not putting a lot of capital deployed at risk. And so you're seeing these, I think, tuck-in acquisitions. They're very modestly dilutive so far, not that they all will be. And at the margin, they cause a little bit of pressure to ROIC. But in the main, over the course of the year, we're still able to drive ROIC higher each and every year. So I actually think, in speaking with our shareholders, this is the most prudent and effective way to build the franchise without having to risk a lot of capital. Ronnie?", "Ronnie Andrews", "And Ross, if I could add, I think if you look at diagnostics in general, you might make the conclusion that you know what, the returns aren't necessarily that accretive to overall business. But I think when you look at molecular diagnostics as an entity within diagnostics, the companies that have really done well there have seen significant return on sales. I know in my rose [ph] molecular years, we were well in the mid-30s in return on sales. And so I think you can see that if we go at this in a very responsible way, targeted at very high-value diagnostic plays, which is how we're approaching it, that we can bring significant impact. The gross margins in this space, as we move to kits, can significantly -- be significantly higher than you might see traditionally in the more competitive life science world at times. But also, keep in mind, I think one of the things that I've enjoyed in my 30 years in the diagnostics space is that the ups and downs of the markets come and go, and the challenges of the macro environment come and go, but people still get sick, and people still get tested and those tests will get reimbursed even in tough economic environments. And so I actually think it's a great place for the company to be looking at. And as Greg said, we're trying to do it very responsibly. And let me let you know we definitely have, I believe, have started to accumulate a solid team that's been there and done it. So we will be able to, in a very appropriate way, bring some value to the company, I hope, in a very short period of time.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And I wanted to talk a bit about the share repurchase. So it seems like you'd like to act aggressively on this. If you look at sort of the stock over the last, I don't know, 5, 6 years, it's been in the sort of $40, $45 level. I think back since '07, you had sort of 6 straight quarters of low, single-digit, organic growth. And I guess, as you're thinking and you're facing, to your point, Greg, the sequester, I mean, I appreciate the shift from a sentiment [ph] perspective on capital deployment to be more shareholder-friendly return capital. I guess it's -- again, to the original question, I forgot to ask it on the call, how are you thinking of this and the timing of sort of the aggressiveness of returning capital via share repurchase or via the dividend given the uncertainty, to some degree, in the environment as a whole and relevant to kind of the returns your stock has had over now a prolonged period of time?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Ross, let me just make sure that the listeners to our conversation have the -- different facts, which is our share price was as high as $57 fairly recently. So I think it hasn't been hovering here for that, that long. And like all companies facing the world economy today, it's a difficult thing to navigate. We're navigating it, we think, in -- with 3 vectors: one is that we want to be able to deploy capital back to shareholders in a very, I think, effective way; the second, we're extremely bullish on Ion Torrent and the opening up of a big, new horizon for us, both in the research and the clinical diagnostics side, and we're literally just starting that; and then the last, to Derik De Bruin's earlier question, we're going to be ever fiercer as a competitor in the research tools market. We're not going away. We're going to get bigger. And we're managing those 3 things, I think, pretty effectively given all the pressures that any company like ours is facing today. So those are the 3 things we're doing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Just a question for Greg or, possibly, Mark. You've seen the genomics market increasingly biased towards exomic sequencing versus whole genomes, and you think you're better positioned for that trend?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "That's a great question. What we've been saying for some time is that a whole genome sequencing is important, but it's really more of a pure research-type thing. What you're seeing in the clinic, and we have designed our instruments with a total bull's-eye on this, is panels and, to some extent, exomes. And both the PGM for panels and the Proton for exomes moves at the speed of health care. It does these things in 2 hours, not 30 hours that a researcher can wait for. And that's why we think we're on the right side of history, if you will, with coming out with this technology of Ion Torrent.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And then what's in the works on the bioinformatics side? It still remains a huge stumbling block.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I think it remains a huge stumbling block if you're trying to analyze an entire human genome. I mean, that is a monstrosity of an IT challenge. If you're trying to analyze a gene panel, that's a more manageable IT task. And I think that's where the analysts have to get to the next level of specificity. So on that point, we think we have a very compelling software suite that goes with Ion Torrent on the panel side and soon to the exome side. These are more manageable data sets, and we've got an extremely large team just focused entirely on that.", "Ronnie Andrews", "And if you throw on top of that the Navigenics portal that we have and the ability to use curated data sets that already exist in the medical community, we're able to take the Ion information and put it with phenotypic information and really represent, from a bioinformatic perspective, potential outcomes that are relevant to decision making. So again, you're right on. I think the bioinformatics challenge in the genomics world is great and can't be underestimated, but I think we're on top of it and have a nice portfolio of solutions for that.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And then just finally for Ronnie. If you look 2 years out, how many tests do you think you'll have approved? And how many will be lab-developed tests?", "Ronnie Andrews", "Let me say this. Look, the lab -- as I said in my prepared remarks, the lab is sort of a means to an end. And our end is to use the CLIA lab as a development engine to develop content for pharmaceutical companies, but also to take proprietary content that today has been developed by academic researchers that's ready for market and really bring it through our lab and then take it into the clinical realm, clearly using it to be a trial site for us to prepare for regulatory processes, et cetera. So we are looking at the key areas I mentioned. But clearly, oncology is a rich area for content right now. I think you'll see us very active in partnership, where we can be, and potential licensing. And also, we will need to open for potential tuck-in acquisitions as well going forward, all around key content. But one thing you can note is there'll be high-value content, there will be content that will be applicable to one of our platforms and can allow us to put it into kits and globalize it very rapidly because the ability to CE-mark a kit, once we bought it through our system, through our CLIA lab, is really rapid, and we can begin to move on the global installed base probably more rapidly than we could if we were looking at the U.S. opportunity alone. So one of the beautiful things about Life and one of the things that's really impressed me since I've been here 5 months now is we are a global company. And I'm encouraging the diagnostics team that we're building to think globally first because the opportunities for us in this world of molecular diagnostics clearly are great x U.S. or as great x U.S. as they are in the United States. So you'll see a lot of the content that we moved to be focused on rest-of-world capabilities and needs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First one will be for Ronnie. Just trying to maybe put some framework around how we should think about the build-out of your diagnostic strategy. And is there a time frame when you guys might want to talk a little bit more about your long-term revenue goals there and sort of what other things that you need to add to the puzzle to have that business in a place where you're happy?", "Ronnie Andrews", "Sure, Isaac. Listen, we've spent the first really 100 days here putting the strategy together, really pressure testing the market opportunities, taking into account the stewardship that we want to apply to capital deployment. And all those things kind of culminated in the strategy that we're now executing around the Navigenics asset, which is really for the physician portal, as well to get a CLIA lab that we can develop in. And then obviously, the Pinpoint Genomics test, which gives us a game-changing and life-saving lung cancer panel that can be immediately transferred to kits for rest-of-the-world use. So those are the sort of the first 2 moves. But I think as we think about the strategy, there is obviously more to come. And at some point in the near future, I think we will be prepared to maybe put out more prognostic in terms of revenue and placements data. But today, still early, and a lot of negotiations that are ongoing with some of the key partnerships are still in the early phases, and we wouldn't want to adulterate those conversations by being too verbose at this time. So if you'll just give me another 30 to 60 days, we should be in a position, as we get to the end of next quarter, to be a little clearer on how it's going to look in 2013. But one thing you can note, and Greg and team here, when I came, they challenged me to think of this as a start-up venture and to make sure that we thought about this in terms of not burning cash but figuring out ways for the business to create revenue for itself to deploy back into the business, to grow in that method. And candidly, the team I've put together, we've done that numerous times now in our career, and that's what we're focused on. So I think you can see this as a great opportunity to really tackle some huge opportunities. Next-gen sequencing is going to be an amazing tool for the industry. Ion Torrent is clearly the absolute best platform, in my opinion as a diagnostician, to democratize this information. But we've got to get that information as part of standard of care. And that takes a while to bring these next-gen sequences in, synthesize them with large, mathematical engines, and then begin to apply those in the clinic at the doc -- double -- what I call the double-doc level first, which is the Ph.D., M.D., and then moving it down into the communities. And our business really explodes globally when we conquer that 300- to 400-bed hospital environment and are able to deliver game-changing information there. And we really feel like we're a company that's well positioned to do that. So those are the kind of things, as I head towards what strategy is going to look like, you'll see, as we begin to announce and really talk more about it in the coming months.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. If I could just ask a follow-up for Dave or Greg on the guidance. Third quarter, if we just sort of take what you guys are looking for in third quarter revenue and then the implied sequential acceleration in revenue, it's probably a little bit bigger than what you saw last year on an absolute dollar basis. So can you maybe help us frame how much of that sequential uptick will come from the Proton ramp versus just sort of the underlying business? That'll be very helpful.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, we haven't broken that out specifically, and we'd rather not talk about the specific sales that we've got targeted for PGM and Proton. But you can assume that we're not expecting any significant acceleration in the base business. So the rest of it comes from the 2 things that we've commented on. We expect some pickup in Applied Sciences. So we've got a deal there that we said was $5 million to $10 million. There's another deal that we've got in there roughly about that size in the fourth quarter. And then the rest of it comes from Ion Torrent.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So David, I want talk about the Applied Science order shift in the back half. But I'm -- I guess I'm not really clear about why that business had such a monster quarter this quarter, in the second quarter. So is there any onetime items that were benefiting that business in the second quarter of '12?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, and -- yes. And really, the big drivers of that business are BioProduction and Forensics, both of which, we've talked about in the past, tend to be lumpy businesses. Over any longer period of time, they're going to grow in the high-single digits, low teens, but in any one quarter, you can get a big order. BioProduction, which I mentioned a number of times in my prepared remarks, had an unexpectedly big quarter for us. Demand, as I think a number of other people in this space have commented on, has been very strong, continued strong in BioProduction. So we happen to get some big orders as well.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, good color. My last one is any short-term metrics you can offer on these 2 small acquisitions you gave in terms of revenue or invested capital would be great. And I appreciate if you don't want to go into that, but in terms of back half revenue contribution and deal size, I would love any color you [indiscernible] there.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, both of them, in terms of revenue in the second half of the year, are very small, basically insignificant in the scheme of things. Yes, we have ramping...", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, we have -- look, we've got these tests now. They just launched the Pinpoint assay. Paper was just published in January. We've got obviously a lot of market interest. But we have to go out and develop that market, and clearly, that's what we're going to be doing in the second half of this year. So the real revenue opportunity for us in any one of these scenarios where there's a proprietary test that's new to the market like that, it usually -- the revenue ramp usually lags the actual market launch by 6 to 8 months. So I think you can expect that here. We'll be launching, as I said, in the fall time frame, late fall. So as you see that come out as a soft launch, you can then suspect somewhere between 6 and 9 months till we'll see the revenue ramp for that. So it certainly won't impact second half, as David said.", "Carol A. Cox", "All right then. I think that'll be the end of the call.

Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until November 23, 2012.

Casper", "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today on our third quarter earnings call. I'm very pleased to report that we continued our growth momentum from the first half of the year into Q3. Our teams executed well to deliver record third quarter revenue and EPS by continuing to focus on our initiatives to grow the business and gain market share. Our strong results so far this year positions us to meet our goals for 2012 and give us a solid foundation as we move into 2013. Later in the call, I'll share a few thoughts on our updated guidance as we close out the year. But first, let me focus on the quarter starting with our financial highlights, then moving onto what we saw in our end markets and ending with some great examples of how we're positioning the company for continued growth and success.", "So first the financials. As I mentioned, we delivered record third quarter adjusted EPS with an 11% increase over 2011. Our revenue, another record performance, grew by 5% over last year. Finally, our adjusted operating income also increased 5% in Q3. Our results highlight how well we've continued to navigate the economic environment. Our strong top line performance, solid operational discipline and effective capital deployment have resulted in adjusted EPS growth of 20% over the first 9 months of the year. The dynamics of our end markets have played out as we expected. We planned accordingly, we executed well, and we set ourselves up to deliver a very strong year.", "Let's talk about our growth for a minute and where it's coming from, and I'll share a few observations. First, our value proposition is really making a difference for our customers and puts us in a unique position in our industry. We have innovative, high-impact products through our Thermo Scientific brand. We have a leading channel to market through Fisher Scientific, and we have the most comprehensive service capabilities through Unity Lab Services. This differentiated offering is what we bring to our customers when they work with Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "I spend a significant amount of my time meeting with our customers. I think it's one of the most important things that I do. I recently visited several of our largest European accounts, serving markets ranging from pharma to industrial. It was clear from my discussions that they appreciate the value we provide as a strategic partner, and they are looking to us to help them achieve their goals in the current environment. Second, our global presence is a key advantage in terms of market penetration and cost efficiency. As you know, we're expanding our presence in emerging markets, and we had another strong quarter in the APAC region. China came in with better than 20% growth again this quarter. The team there is doing fantastic work, and we plan to have the grand opening for our new life sciences consumable plant in Suzhou next month. I'll mention here that we had excellent growth in the quarter in South Korea and good growth in India as well. In fact, I just came back from visiting our operations in Mumbai. For us, India is about a $2 billion addressable market. We're very excited about the long-term opportunities that we have there in industries such as a pharmaceutical health care, food safety and the environment.", "The last point I want to make about growth is that we never stop innovating. Our innovation pipeline is full, and we're continuing to introduce new products and services that create real value for our customers. For example, the new analytical instrument products we've recently launched are selling well. The Q Exactive has turned out to be a game-changing instrument for mass spectrometry customers in both research and applied markets. We also have excellent momentum with our share gain initiatives in gas chromatography where we are leveraging the leading technologies of both Thermo Fisher and Dionex. Both our TRACE 1300 GC and our TSQ 8000 triple quad GC/MS systems, launched earlier this year, are selling extremely well especially in applied markets such as food safety and environmental testing. I'll highlight some of our more recent launches within Specialty Diagnostics in a minute.", "While we have a lot of initiatives in place to position the company for growth, we are also being prudent and carefully managing our costs as we always do. Through our productivity levers, including our PPI business system, sourcing programs and global footprint optimization, we delivered 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion through the first 9 months of the year. Looking ahead, we know the potential for sequestration is around the corner. We've been planning for it. We'll closely monitor the market environment, and we'll take additional cost actions as necessary.", "Turning to our 4 primary end markets. As I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, the dynamics played out pretty much as we expected in the quarter. In pharma and biotech, conditions have been very consistent what we've seen all year long, and we're continuing to gain share across a broad base of customers. Our value proposition is really resonating, and we're helping our pharma and biotech customers meet their goals for both innovation and productivity. Once again, we grew in the high single digits with these customers and saw a continued strength in our bioprocess production business as well as clinical trials logistics.", "We had a good quarter in health care and diagnostics, which grew in the mid-single digits. We have great momentum here and had strong sales across a number of our Specialty Diagnostics businesses, including biomarkers. We significantly enhanced our Specialty Diagnostics portfolio over the past year, and we're clearly benefiting from being able to offer these customers a more comprehensive menu of products. We're also leveraging our extensive Asia-Pacific presence to serve the growing health care needs in that region and accelerate growth of our Specialty Diagnostic businesses.", "Looking at our other 2 key end markets, our comparisons with the year-ago quarter were more of the story here. In academic and government end markets, conditions were basically the same as what we've been seeing all year. So our view here hasn't changed. Our customers are dealing with the weaker funding environment, and spending on capital equipment continues to be constrained, while sales of laboratory consumables remains less effective. We benefited this quarter from an easy comparison, so we actually grew in the low single digits for the quarter.", "Last, in industrial and applied markets, we declined in the low single digits in Q3. This is where we had our toughest comparison, having grown in the mid-teens in Q3 last year. Some of our industrial customers are taking longer to make decisions in the current environment. We did see pockets of strength however. For example, our air quality monitors are selling well, especially in China, and we saw good demand from customers in applied markets such as food safety.", "Let me cover a few of our business highlights for the quarter. These are good examples of some of the initiatives we're pursuing to better serve our customers and generate growth. First, you know we're committed to innovation, and I already mentioned that our key Thermo Scientific products introduced this year in Analytical Technologies are doing quite well. This quarter, we launched new products in our Specialty Diagnostics portfolio at the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, including new immunoassays, analyzers and related chemistry controls. This reinforces that we're focused on helping our customers in clinical laboratories improve both productivity and patient care. For example, our new QMS Tacrolimus immunoassay, which is now available in Europe, is used to monitor the most commonly prescribed immunosuppressant drug for transplant patients to prevent organ rejection. This is a liquid, ready-to-use assay with bar-coded reagents that runs on our Indiko benchtop analyzer. We recently upgraded this successful analyzer platform to launch a new-generation instrument called Indiko Plus in the U.S. This new analyzer is designed to deliver higher throughput for specialty testing in the clinical lab, including drugs-of-abuse screening and monitoring of therapeutic drugs.", "In immunodiagnostics, we expanded our offering for the diagnosis and monitoring of allergies, asthma and autoimmune diseases. Our EliA rheumatoid factor assays give clinicians a reliable and simple tool for the diagnosis of arthritis and our ImmunoCAP Tryptase assays provides an indication of systemic mast cell disease. Both of these assays are cleared for sale in the U.S.", "Let me turn a minute to our biosciences business, which, as you know, has been doing well all year, especially in bioprocess production for the biotech industry. We also have a great opportunity here for our molecular biology portfolio, which we haven't talked about as much. We had some developments here in the quarter that speak to our initiatives to expand our offering and better serve our customers on a global scale. You may remember that we acquired 2 businesses a couple of years ago, Fermentas and Finnzymes, to increase our capabilities in the high-growth market for PCR testing. Fermentas had a significant presence in Vilnius, Lithuania, which is known for its outstanding academic institutions and a highly skilled life sciences workforce. Last month, we established a Center of Excellence for molecular biology in Vilnius. The new facility provides products for our life sciences customers globally, who are accelerating their work in PCR-based testing and DNA research to develop treatments for disease. In addition to world-class reagent production, the site has an outstanding R&D center that's focused on the development of new products for all aspects of molecular biology. The new center not only increases our depth of capabilities to support our global customer base, but also strengthens our presence in emerging high-growth markets within Eastern Europe.", "Let me now turn to capital deployment, an important part of our growth strategy, and give you a quick update on our activities in the quarter. First, as you know, in September we closed our acquisition of One Lambda, which is now part of our Specialty Diagnostics segment. I participated in our Day 1 activities at the headquarters in California, and it was great to personally welcome 300 new colleagues to our team. The business has a terrific legacy of innovation in tissue typing and antibody testing for transplant patients, and it's a nice complement to our immunosuppressant assays for monitoring therapeutic drugs. We're very excited about this combination and the opportunities it offers to prevent donor rejection and ultimately improve the lives of transplant patients around the world.", "I'll make one last comment to highlight the effectiveness of our capital deployment strategy. When you look back, we've reported excellent free cash flow so far this year, generating about $1.2 billion in the first 9 months. This has allowed us to invest to expand our offering for our customers, such as our recent acquisitions of Doe & Ingalls and One Lambda. And it's allowed us to return about $900 million of capital to our shareholders in stock buybacks and dividends through the third quarter of this year.", "Before I turn it over to Pete, I'll make some comments about our full year guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for 2012. We have a strong 9 months behind us, and we're also factoring in the close of One Lambda and slightly improved foreign exchange rates. We now expect a generate revenue of $12.32 billion to $12.40 billion in 2012, which leads to 7% revenue growth year-over-year. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $4.81 to $4.88, which leads to 16% to 17% adjusted EPS growth over 2011.", "So let me summarize the key takeaways from Q3. It was a great quarter. We executed well, and we're seeing the results of our growth initiatives in our strong revenue and earnings performance. We continue to keep a close eye on our end markets and are prepared to take additional actions, if necessary, to ensure that we successfully navigate the economic environment. We were able to raise our guidance throughout the year in a tough environment and are confident that we'll achieve our goals and deliver a strong 2012.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Pete Wilver. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of the total company's financial performance and then provide some color on each of our 3 segments before moving onto our updated guidance. To reinforce what Marc said, in Q3, we delivered another quarter of strong top line and bottom line results, which led to an 11% increase in adjusted EPS to a third quarter record of $1.19. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.79, up 14% from $0.69 in the prior year's quarter.", "Starting with the top line, total revenue increased 5% year-over-year. On a pro forma basis, as if Phadia were owned for the entire third quarter in 2011, reported revenue was up 3% and organic revenue was up 4%. Pro forma revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions other than Phadia, which was more than offset by a 3% headwind from foreign currency translation. Two things to note: One, the components of the pro forma change in revenue do not sum due to rounding; And two, Q3 is the last quarter we'll be reporting revenue on a pro forma basis, given we passed the 1-year anniversary of the Phadia acquisition in Q3.", "In terms of bookings, we continue to strengthen our backlog, with bookings slightly exceeding revenue in the quarter. Looking at revenue by geography, we saw growth across all regions. North America and rest of world grew in the low single digits, Europe in the mid-single digits, and Asia Pac grew in the high single digits, with China coming in very strong once again at over 20% growth.", "Turning to adjusted operating income, we delivered a good quarter. Q3 adjusted operating income was up 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.7%, flat versus prior year. This quarter, we had very robust contributions from our productivity and cost actions. We continue to benefit from successfully executing on the $100 million restructuring program that we initiated last year, and we're still on track to achieve about $50 million of benefit this year and $15 million of incremental carryover benefit in 2013 from that restructuring program. We've also continued to evaluate additional restructuring actions, given the uncertain economic environment, and have initiated another $75 million of actions throughout this year, with the majority of the benefits coming in 2013. In total, we realized about $16 million of benefit from our restructuring actions in Q3.", "Despite all these actions and strong growth in the quarter, our margin expansion was lower than you might expect primarily as a result of 2 factors: First, we experienced higher-than-normal transactional FX losses this year compared with gains in the prior year's quarter, which resulted in over 40 basis points of headwind from FX. Second, we made incremental strategic investments this quarter of about 25 basis points above our run rate, primarily in emerging markets to continue the growth momentum we are seeing there, as well as in information technology, to improve our efficiency and customer service.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44% in Q3, flat versus the prior year. As I mentioned, we delivered very strong productivity this quarter, which was driven by familiar themes: first, global sourcing, where we continued to achieve savings by reducing our supply base and establishing new suppliers in low-cost regions; second, site consolidations, which reduced our significant footprint; and third, our PPI business system, where our employees reduce waste and improve efficiency. These benefits were offset by foreign exchange and unfavorable segment and product line mix.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 22.3% of revenue down 10 basis points from the 2011 quarter. And finally R&D expense came in at 3% of revenues, which was flat year-over-year. As a reminder, R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue is about 5.5%.", "Below the line, net interest expense was $54 million, which was $12 million above Q3 last year as a result of the debt we issued to fund the Phadia and One Lambda acquisitions. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16.9%, down slightly from Q2 and down 160 basis points from last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax planning efforts.", "As you saw on our press release, we had another significant quarter in terms of returning capital to our shareholders. During Q3, we spent $400 million to buy back 7.1 million shares of our stock, and through the first 9 months of this year, we've deployed $800 million of cash to buy back 15.1 million of our shares and distributed another $95 million in dividends. Average diluted shares were 365 million in the quarter, down 4 million from Q2 and down 17 million or 5% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2011 and 2012 share buyback programs.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, we had excellent cash flow this quarter. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $1.40 billion, and free cash flow was $1.20 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $199 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was up 39% year-over-year primarily as a result of higher operating income, lower cash taxes and improved working capital, partially offset by higher interest expense. So we continue to execute very well here.", "We ended the quarter with about $835 million in cash and investments, up $100 million from Q2. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $7.47 billion, up $940 million from Q2 as a result of our $1.3 billion debt offering in August, partially offset by paying down $350 million of our outstanding commercial paper balance.", "So with that, let me turn to this quarter's performance by each of our 3 business segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies, total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue increased 3%. This quarter, we saw strong growth in our businesses serving bioprocess production as well as in a number of our businesses serving applied markets, such as our HPLC products. This was partially offset by softness in some of our industrial markets. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies decreased 2%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.9%, down 60 basis points. In this segment we had strong contribution from our productivity actions and good pull-through on organic growth, but this was more than offset by the impact of targeted strategic investments and foreign exchange.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, total revenue grew 15%. On a pro forma basis, assuming Phadia were owned for the entire third quarter of the prior year, total revenue increased 2% and organic revenue grew 5%. We continue to see strong growth in our clinical diagnostics business, including biomarkers, and in general, we delivered good growth across the segment. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 13%, with adjusted operating margin at 24.1%, down 30 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of foreign exchange.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, total revenue grew 5% and organic revenue also increased by 5%. In the quarter, we had solid growth in laboratory consumables, and our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver strong results. This segment is performing well with 5% organic growth so far this year, partially as a result of strength in our channel. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 7%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.2%, up 30 basis points driven by solid cost per activity.", "Now moving on to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising and tightening our 2012 guidance range to reflect our strong year-to-date operating performance, the acquisition of One Lambda and slightly improved foreign currency rates. To bridge from the midpoint of our previous revenue guidance, the addition of One Lambda added about $50 million, foreign currency translation increased revenues by about $85 million, and we added $25 million of organic growth. This leads to a new revenue guidance range of $12.32 billion to $12.40 billion, which represents reported growth of about 7% compared to our prior year revenue of $11.56 billion. On a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for all of the prior year, the midpoint of our organic growth guidance remains at about 3%, but is slightly higher than our previous guidance.", "In terms of FX, the estimated full year negative impact on revenue is now $280 million versus the $365 million we included in our previous guidance. So for the full year, we're now assuming a 2% year-over-year headwind on reported revenue and 3% on adjusted EPS. We're estimating that completed acquisitions, other than Dionex and Phadia, will contribute approximately 1% to our expected growth in 2012, and as usual, we're using recent FX rates, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "In terms of our full year 2012 adjusted EPS, we are again raising guidance this quarter. With 3 strong quarters of the year behind us and reflecting the impact of the revenue factors I've just described, we're raising both the high and low ends of our adjusted EPS guidance as well as tightening the range, resulting in a $0.05 increased to a new midpoint of $4.84. Our revised adjusted EPS guidance range is $4.81 to $4.88, which represents 16% to 17% growth over 2011. To once again bridge from the midpoint of our previous adjusted EPS guidance, One Lambda adds about $0.03, FX adds about $0.01 and our improved operational performance including the tax rate adds another $0.01. As a reminder, in our previous guidance, we had already included the favorable impact of our recent $500 million share buyback, as well as the unfavorable impact of the interest expense relating to our $1.3 billion debt offering.", "In terms of adjusted operating margin, we delivered 70 basis points of margin expansion through the first 9 months of the year, and we expect to deliver about 70 basis points for the full year. Below the line, we're expecting our net interest expense to be up about $70 million over last year, unchanged from our previous guidance. As a reminder, we have $350 million of senior notes coming due at year end, which we intend to pay down. We expect our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 17.0% to 17.5%, and we're estimating our full year, average diluted share count to be in the range of 364 million to 368 million, down 4% to 5% from last year and consistent with our previous guidance.", "In terms of return of capital, we started Q4 with $350 million remaining on our existing share buyback authorization, and our guidance assumes that we'll spend the entire $350 million through its expiration at the end of this year. We're also assuming that we'll pay another $47 million in dividends in Q4, consistent with our current rate. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $290 million to $300 million for the year.", "In interpreting our guidance ranges, as I've stated previously, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see 2012 playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our end markets and other economic factors during the balance of the year.", "So before we turn to Q&A, I'd like to say that I'm very pleased with how we performed in the first 3 quarters of the year, and I'm looking forward to a strong finish to 2012. Now I'll turn the call over to Q&A. Ken?", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Thanks, Pete. Operator, we're ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have our first question in the queue from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Do you think, Marc, you could maybe -- there's a lot of interest obviously and focus given throughout this earning season on just kind of sequential trends and specifically, I think kind of capital equipment weakness going into the kind of ending the quarter and going into the fourth quarter. So can you maybe just talk about kind of what you saw and what you're seeing there?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, from the -- how both Q3 played out and how we thought about our guidance at the beginning of Q4, remarkably consistent activity throughout the quarter and going into the beginning of this quarter. So we feel good about the guidance that we outlined.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "So nothing of note in terms of things that were -- I mean, industrial was maybe a little bit weaker than Analytical Technologies, but there's nothing major of note there that you see changing in your markets?", "Marc N. Casper", "From the way I thought about that question was more about what do the 13 weeks look like. Looking forward, right, which is as we're sitting here today on the end markets, our basic assumptions are industrial and applied markets, while we continue to see good pockets of strength in environmental and food safety, as we look to Q4, our guidance is reflecting a softening of the industrial end markets. And obviously, we have another difficult comparison, so we're assuming that the end market in industrial gets -- is going to get a little bit softer.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then if I could just follow up on specifically on Lab Products and Services, I mean, Marc, maybe because over the last few years, it's been a business that kind of has a good year and then kind of doesn't have as good of a year. And then has a good year and then maybe not as good of a year. And looks like this year, it's shaping out to stabilize the margin. Is there something sustainable you think happening there or maybe just talk a little bit about that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, our Lab Products and Services business is basically driving productivity for our customers, and as the economic environment came out of the recession, it was more muted than other recoveries. This business is clearly gaining share. And so we're very positive on the outlook for our Lab Products and Services business, and we are making a huge difference for our customers. So it doesn't mean that every single quarter is going to be perfect, smooth growth, but the reality is that the business is doing well, and it's contributing to our earnings growth, and it's contributing to our top line growth as well. So we're excited about the prospects for that business.", "Operator", "We have the next question from the line of Jon Wood from Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So, Marc, just I know it's early, but if we kind of look at -- out to 2013, is it reasonable to assume kind of a normal year on capital redeployment in terms of the percentage of free cash flow back to shareholders? I mean, obviously, you're tracking well ahead of that with something like 75% returned year-to-date, but I'd love to hear kind of the way you're thinking big picture about redeployment in '13.", "Marc N. Casper", "Jon, as we think about 2013, we're going to give our guidance in late January when we do our Q4 earnings call. So we'll come out with the -- with our plans for capital deployment. But clearly, we obviously have a dividend in place, and we're likely to return some portion of our cash flow through buybacks. I mean that's consistent with the modeling that Pete laid out in May. But we have more debt on the balance sheet, so we'll probably strengthen the balance sheet by repaying some debt, and then obviously we'll be opportunistic on terrific acquisitions.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, great. My follow-up is for Pete. On the restructuring program this year, the $75 million, what do you expect to be the payout or payback in terms of savings of that program in '13?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So it's probably something in the range of $45 million, which will help. So kind of similar to what we're getting this year on a year-over-year basis. So we're going to get same as with the $100 million we put in place last year. We'll get a portion of it this year and most of it next year and then a little bit of carryover into 2014.", "Operator", "We have a next question from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "For the fourth quarter, can you maybe comment on your organic growth outlook for the fourth quarter? It seems like it might be negative, and I'm wondering if there's anything there besides the softer industrial assumption.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So what's implied in the guidance is about 1% organic growth for the fourth quarter. That's the midpoint.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the gross margin or, I guess, on the operating margin in Specialty Diagnostics, it's oscillating quite a bit year-to-date with the third quarter being the low point. Can you give a little more color on what's driving the oscillation in that line?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned in my comments, the margin decline year-over-year was really impacted by foreign exchange in Specialty Diagnostics over the 100 basis point headwind. So when I look down at all the other factors that affect margins year-over-year, that's the prime factor. Everything else was pretty much in line. We had good pull-through on organic growth. We always have inflation of some level, which offsets some of our productivity, but the big factor was really foreign exchange.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Oh, but I was more speaking to the prior quarter's, the 20.5% [ph] then 27.2%, then 24.1%. I'm just not sure where the trend line might sit for forecasting.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So the -- it's probably best to look at the more recent quarters. Obviously, we've got transplant diagnostics coming in, in Q4, so we'll probably see a little uptick as a result of that.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So you finally got into a pretty good groove here in terms of outperforming the peers on growth, execution, et cetera. I mean if you sort of go back to Q3 of last year, which was obviously a challenging period for you guys, and you think about within the organization how you've approached things differently and how you've approached the Street differently, I mean walk us through sort of the transition path from what was a tough period and the sort of lessons learned and sort of what -- how you've sort of reflected that in the business for the last couple of quarters where you've had obviously much better execution and really done well versus the peers in the broader market.", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Ross, I think the way that we think about it here is our job is to do a great job of serving our customers, do a great job of communicating how we're performing and what our expectations are and manage the company well. And Q3 was a disappointment to our shareholder base, and it wasn't something -- it wasn't our best quarter. And when I think about it, for all of us, it was a re-energizing moment, right? I mean it was one of those things where, well, if you look at it versus Q2 or Q1, it really wasn't that different. But it disappointed, and therefore, we used it to re-energize our 39,000 colleagues. We learned from it, and if I think about the last 4 quarters, we've got a lot of confidence, I mean, across the company. Our customers are excited to working with us. I'm spending a huge amount of time with customers as is the entire leadership team. And Pete's out there, visiting CFOs and heads of procurement at organizations. I mean, we're having fun, right? We don't make excuses. We deliver good results, and we don't get too high. We're not sitting here doing victory laps. It's a tough world out there, but we feel good about our prospects. We feel great about our market position. And our job is to communicate how we think the world's going to play out and then execute well.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "That makes total sense. I mean obviously as you're kind of going into the fourth quarter, you talked about some of the puts and takes, and obviously, industrial is a key piece. I mean as you were thinking about the fiscal cliff, the sequesters, you're talking about that with customers. There's a lot of questions, right, both on demand, on taxes, et cetera. I mean, how do you sort of contingency plan for that? I mean, you've left a wider range maybe than typical by $0.01 or so for the fourth quarter, but how do you sort put in place at least whether it's on the cost side, maybe it's on what you do with buyback, et cetera, measures to make sure you feel comfortable about, sort of your bottom line execution is obviously -- it's harder to know what pushes and pulls will happen over the next couple of months.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I think that first of all we put expectations on the top line to reflect that uncertainty, right, with a 1% organic growth at the midpoint, and the basic underlying assumptions is that we've got good momentum in pharma and biotech. We have good position with health care and diagnostics so not big changes there. Industrial will soften, and we're assuming that academic and government, because the comp is harder, is going to, again, be more muted in terms of contribution to our growth in the quarter. So that's the assumption we made. We've been managing our costs aggressively to position ourselves for this environment. And that was what Pete referred to with the $75 million of additional work. We chose not to do it in a program but actually, just do the work throughout the year to reduce our costs and set ourselves up to be successful in this environment. So the range is a little wider as Pete articulated, and we think it's a reasonable assumption given the uncertainty in the end markets.", "Operator", "We have a next question in the queue from the line of Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Marc, you discussed in your prepared remarks how the company continues to take share. Maybe can you just highlight the key businesses where this is occurring and where you see the biggest opportunities going forward for continued share gains.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so we only have maybe 20 minutes left, so I can't use it all up on this one, Dan. But no, I'm joking. But the areas of highlights is, if you look at it in the quarter, life sciences mass spec did really well. Bioprocess production did really well. HPLC did really well. GC did exceptionally well. So that gives you a flavor of the instrument portion. Our channel business is doing well in the marketplace. So I feel good about that. More of our biopharma customers are outsourcing activities from in-house to us, so share of wallet is increasing. It's -- we don't have that many competitors there, but we're taking more of that business that used to be done in-house. So that gives you a flavor for some of the areas where we feel like we're gaining market share.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And are you seeing related to that -- I mean some of that is obviously innovation driven, but given the environment we're in and your kind of strategy to kind of get closer to your customers and deliver more, how much is that really playing into it now, whether it be you're able to offer better price or you can just offer a spectrum of services that competitors can't? Can you kind of distinguish between that?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I mean, it's not really price driven. When you look at the -- on the technology side, that's clearly just great product, right? So that -- we talked about it at the Analyst Day. We talked about it at some of the conferences earlier in the year. We just have a sweet spot in our innovation launches. So that's driving that portion. But the environment -- more of our customers are just spending disproportionate time with us. I mean that's the reality, which is they're thinking about how do they make their innovation goals, how do they make their productivity goals. And this industry is so fragmented, we are so much larger than the other players that it's too much work to go to the smaller players. Why do you want to have 7 meetings when you can meet with 1 company that will say, \"okay, what do you need to accomplish?\" And then we just put the playbook out and say, \"okay, here's how you're going to make your productivity goals.\" And that's resonating incredibly well with the customer base.", "Operator", "We have a next question from the line of Paul Knight from CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "The VWR and Fisher businesses 10, 15 years ago never grew, even in a good year, 5%. What's behind 5% product growth of that division?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in Lab Products and Services, you have our channel business, you have our lab consumables, lab equipment and very strong growth from our biopharma services business, which is our outsourcing business. So it's a blend of all of those businesses, and those businesses generally are serving the sweet spot of customers driving for productivity, and particularly our biopharma services business, as well as our channel businesses, is really helping our customers there. So that's where you're seeing nice, strong sustainable growth.", "Operator", "We have a next question from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So a couple of questions that are sort of boring. How are you thinking about the med device tax mixture? Do you guys get impacted by that dramatically?", "Marc N. Casper", "So yes, the answer is not dramatically, but yes, we are affected by it. It's about $25 million of costs that we'll be picking up in our Specialty Diagnostics business as a result of the regulation that goes into effect January 1.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. The -- since you've mentioned Fermentas and the PCR market, what are you seeing in the dynamics of that market now that some of the qPCR patents have expired? What's happening with pricing the space in the competitive landscape?", "Marc N. Casper", "We are a small player, so our prospects there, we think, are good because we're leveraging our huge commercial reach. When I look at our portfolio, we have very good products. We have a huge sales force, and we are manufacturing in a very, very low-cost location with an incredibly talented workforce. In my last trip to Lithuania just -- we have a huge number of Ph.D.s, huge number of folks with Masters degrees and great relationship with the local universities, so we can really get terrific employees. So we like our competitive position, and for us, it's one of the very few businesses we have where we're relatively a niche player, and we're building that out to gain share.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Amit Bhalla from Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Wanted to just ask about Phadia and Dionex and their contribution in the quarter. They have heavy presence in Europe, and I know I think last quarter the businesses were dilutive. So can you talk a little bit about the performance this quarter?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So Dionex is 100% integrated into the business at this point. It's well over a year past the acquisition, and Phadia is at the anniversary as well. But the organic growth of the company would be the same with or without those businesses. Obviously, only Phadia was pro forma, so we would have delivered the 4% growth either way.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Could you be a little more specific on just how Phadia is doing in the U.S. versus Europe?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. Absolutely. So in terms of Phadia in North America, it's doing extremely well with good growth. We also have launched some new products that will position the business for bright growth. We're still seeing significant softness in Southern Europe, which we highlighted last quarter. So Phadia in aggregate is growing a little bit less than the Specialty Diagnostics segment average.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the mass spec side, you talked about gaining share there. Can you just talk about what your view is of market growth and what are the types of accounts and products you're gaining share from within mass spec?", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks for the question, Amit. The Q Exactive is doing extremely well. So that's for both applied markets as well as traditional life sciences, and it's at the high end of that market segment. So we clearly are seeing very strong momentum with the Q Exactive in life sciences mass spec.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And how fast do you think the market's growing?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's -- it's probably growing mid-single digits, I would think, but my take is, is that we've got a lot of customer attention right now.", "Operator", "We have a next question from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Pete, I think this first question's for you. A solid sequential increase in Analytical Technology operating margins, but I think it was about a 60 basis point year-over-year decline. Was this as expected? I guess, specifically what I want to get at is there were no changes in pricing dynamics, correct? It just sounds like this was FX and the fact that some of the investments you highlighted in your prepared remarks had a disproportionate impact on this business. Is that correct?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, it really is the same story, as I mentioned, on Specialty Diagnostics. When I look across the different elements of the year-over-year margin bridge and how that's trended over the last few quarters, price is basically the same number. Productivity is actually stronger than normal. It's way in the high end. Investments were higher, and FX hit us by about 80 basis points in that segment.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then I apologize if I'm missed this, but One Lambda, what was the contribution in Q3? And can you remind us what your expectations for One Lambda are for year 1 assuming those haven't changed?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So, Doug, in terms of the -- it was de minimis in Q3. It closed with less than 2 weeks to go or so in the quarter, so it had no impact there, a minimal impact.", "Peter M. Wilver", "And then the first year, accretion in 2013, we guided to $0.09 to $0.11.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. so that -- does that change because the deal closed a little early? Or should we still be thinking about that for 2013?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. I probably -- to be honest, I haven't done the year-over-year compare, but there's -- we'll probably lose a little bit on the year-over-year accretion as a result of getting a little bit more this year.", "Marc N. Casper", "Shouldn't be particularly meaningfully difference.", "Operator", "We have a next question in the queue from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I want to try to ask this 2013 question a little bit differently. So I think earlier this year, you commented that you saw a path to double-digit earnings growth kind of with or without sequestration, and I'm just kind of curious, has the environment changed enough that you're going to back off those earnings comments? Or can you still stand by that double-digit growth range?", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Jeff, thanks for the question. So we're right in the midst of our detailed 2013 planning process right now, and it's obviously clear that the environment hasn't gotten any easier and some of the end markets have gotten tougher, but we're remaining focused on delivering on our goal of 10% adjusted EPS growth in 2013. Our plan is to give you the guidance in our Q4 earnings call in late January, but that's the goal we're working towards.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Dan Arias from UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Just a question on investment levels going forward. At this point, how are you guys thinking about deployment of SG&A in China and the emerging markets relative to U.S. and Europe? Do those regions continue to get a bigger piece of the pie in the near term? Or have the things that you've done sort of gotten them closer to where they need to be?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think just given the differential growth rates that we're seeing in emerging markets and is likely to continue for many years, you're going to see more investment in those markets and a tighter level of investment control, much tighter level in Western Europe and the U.S., so I think that's just the reality, probably every company is facing that dynamic of a shifting customer base. So that's the plan. But our job is to manage costs tightly, where we have to take them down and we do, and where we're spending to position the company for success, we will.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And just quickly on One Lambda, how are you thinking about timelines in terms of extending those products into the emerging markets and seeing a benefit from that?", "Marc N. Casper", "So just given that we want to really get it right, get the right infrastructure in place, you're probably talking most of that impact late 2013 into 2014 in terms of emerging market expansion. We're already doing work on it, even though it's only been 5 weeks. It's not as if we haven't started on it, but it takes a while to get momentum in new geographies for business. And when we do our synergy planning, typically revenue synergies come in sort of the year 2, year 3 timeframe not in the year 1 timeframe.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Peter Lawson.", "Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "This is Eric Criscuolo just filling in for Peter. I guess just getting back to the med device fee quickly, where do you plan on recognizing that fee in your P&L?", "Peter M. Wilver", "That goes into cost of goods sold, so it's going to affect margin not revenue.", "Eric Criscuolo - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And then the sluggishness in the industrial end markets this quarter, I know you faced a difficult comp, but was there any other particular subsegment of that, that was causing some weakness?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, I think we had a mid-teens comp, and against that comp, we declined low single digits. When you look at it, what I would classify as the more applied markets, did actually quite well, and you look at the more classic industrial, a little bit softer, mostly characterized by slowing in decision making as opposed to anything more dramatic at this point.", "Operator", "We have our next question from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to talk about China for a minute. That was obviously very strong, and I was wondering if you could comment on the spending patterns you saw across your various end markets there. And the reason I ask this is I'm just trying to get a sense of how the government funding is shaping up relative to the more cyclical spending drivers that you're exposed to in that region.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So, Isaac, we had our strongest performance of the year this quarter in China on a very difficult comparison. We've seen some softness in industrial markets, but we've seen great growth in applied markets, such as environmental and food safety and also in health care. And we stated many times in the past, we're extraordinarily tightly aligned with the 12th Five-Year Plan. So the big focus on health care expansion, food safety, environmental improvements is a sweet spot for Thermo Fisher, so we're powering through the tougher industrial end markets and delivering 20% plus growth for many quarters in a row now.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Yes, that's very impressive. Okay. And then secondly on diagnostics, do you see a heightened level of competition for the assets out there that you're interested in? If so, how are you reevaluating your priorities and the kind of hurdle rates you need to get to, to keep growing that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "We don't change -- I mean we're growing the business organically. That's the focus. We don't change our hurdle rates because of the competitive dynamics on M&A. So if people are willing to do transactions that are value destroying for their shareholder base, let them have that and do it. We're not going to, so our take is we really like the acquisitions we've done. One Lambda looks extraordinarily attractive. It's brand new, but we feel good about the economics there. And when we see those gems, we'll pounce on them, and when we don't like the economics and we've obviously not even looked at a couple of transactions given prices that have transpired, we're extraordinarily disciplined on return metrics.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Sung Ji Nam from Cantor.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "So just a couple of questions on the end markets. First, obviously, you're -- you continue to see strength in food and environment. Could you maybe provide more color around the food and environmental testing outside of China? Are you seeing strength there given that some of your competitors are starting to see slowdown? Just curious as to if you're potentially taking market share or if you are continuing to see the market the grow -- continue to grow in that segment.", "Marc N. Casper", "Well, some of the products that serve that market are doing very well for us, so gas chromatography, our applied app parts of the mass spec business, HPLC, all had strong quarters. And our growth in food safety is not just China. We saw the momentum in India and as well as in other parts of the world, so it's not a single geography. The China one just gets more publicity because the opportunity there is just quite huge in terms of improving the food quality supply within the country.", "Sung Ji Nam - Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., Research Division", "And then in terms of India, you guys are seeing continued strength, but obviously, there are some challenges with currency in terms of CapEx spending. Are you -- is that -- just kind of curious as to what type of -- what trends you're seeing with respect to that.", "Marc N. Casper", "I was just in India, and I actually, through a number of vehicles, I interacted with, they were several hundred customers. I mean so it's was a fascinating catch-up on what's going on. I actually think some very recent reforms going on in the country is actually putting more optimism. So there's this period where the currency weakened and there was pessimism in Q3, but by the end of the third quarter actually and going into this quarter, there seems to be more optimism on what the growth outlook is for the country. So I'm not an economist, but talking to a wide range of customers, there seems to be a view that the government is taking sort of pro-growth, pro-reform actions, which should help the environment for our business.", "Operator", "We have our last question from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "A lot of them might have been answered, but maybe just, one, you talked a lot about the innovation-driven gains you've seen in mass spec and other areas. A lot of this seems to be the function of the stepped up R&D that you implemented a couple of years ago. Can you just talk at a higher level of how you're thinking about R&D investments? Obviously, you're pulling costs in other areas, but it does seem like you got a fairly good return on the step-up in additional R&D. So I was just wondering how you're thinking about the investments there.", "Marc N. Casper", "Generally, I'm comfortable with the level that we're spending on R&D. If a great project comes in front of us, we're willing to spend more, but we also take out areas where we see lower returns. So we are clearly benefiting from the confidence we had in 2009, 2010 in our R&D pipeline. And if you want to make an interesting analogy, which I always like to do, which is if you look at this quarter, we spent a lot more money in emerging markets in this quarter because we're confident in the momentum, and we're setting ourselves up for a bright '13 and '14. And we took that opportunity to strengthen our position in India, strengthen our position in China and a few other markets. And when you're doing well, you're driving good earnings growth, sometimes you get that opportunity to put some money where you think you're going to get great returns for our shareholders. And I think we'll be sitting here a couple of years from now and saying that Thermo Fisher made the right call in terms of even further building out our presence in those high-growth markets. So that's both our view on innovation, Tycho, and emerging markets.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then one of the areas you called out as strong this quarter was bio production. One of your peers had a delay yesterday, but in general, it seems like there's a little bit more enthusiasm for the bio production market. Is that a function of your view of the pipelines and what could be coming to market over the next couple of years or bio generics, can you just talk to the trends there?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think you have a big shift towards the disposable manufacturing going on. So part of it is definitely the demand picture that you just articulated, but part of it moving from stainless steel to disposables. And we have a very strong position in the plastics side of that business in terms of sterile manufacturing. That's done very well for us.", "So let me wrap it up. A few closing thoughts, first of all I'm very proud of our teams for navigating the tough environment to deliver excellent performance through the first 9 months of the year. We're positioned to deliver our strong 2012 and that gives us a solid foundation going into 2013. We look forward to reporting our results for the full year in late January and providing our guidance for 2013 at that time. Thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Have a good day.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the presentation. You may now disconnect.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Ms. Carol Cox, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Carol A. Cox", "Thank you, Jonathan. Good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our press release today a little after 1 p.m. Pacific Time. It posted it on our website at lifetechnologies.com, and we'll be filing it on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We've also posted a deck of slides to accompany the webcast today, which may be found on the Events and Presentations section of our Investor Relations website, along with our other additional earnings materials.", "Joining me on today's call are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; and Dave Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer. Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer, will also be available during the Q&A portion of the call to answer any questions. If you've not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website, at lifetechnologies.com.", "I would like to remind our listeners today that our discussion will include forward-looking statements including, but not limited to, statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated. Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, are detailed in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. It is our intent that these forward-looking statements be protected under the Safe Harbor created by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Additionally, we will be discussing GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A full reconciliation of the GAAP -- excuse me, the non-GAAP measures to GAAP can be found in today's press release or on our website.", "And with that, I will hand the call over to Greg.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Thanks, Carol, and thank you to everyone who's joining us today as we provide an overview of our third quarter results and expectations for the remainder of the year. At a high level, we continue to gain momentum, as we expand into higher growth markets through partnerships, acquisitions and internal development.", "During the quarter, we entered into strategic business partnerships for companion diagnostics, completed the foundation of our Medical Sciences business with tuck-in acquisitions of Navigenics, Pinpoint and Compendia and acquired distributors in China and Chile to continue to extend our footprint in emerging markets.", "We achieved important milestones with several highly anticipated product launches, including the Ion Proton System, a platform whose speed, ease-of-use and affordability will democratize genome sequencing, as well as our Pervenio Lung test, the first-of-its-kind molecular test to identify early-stage lung cancer patients, who are at a high risk of reoccurrence following surgery. I'm extremely pleased with the progress of our management team is making across our business platforms and geographies. We are moving fast in a disciplined way.", "Now let me turn to the results. We finished the quarter ahead of our expectations as continued strength across several our businesses contributed to results. Revenue for the quarter came in higher than expected at $911 million, as significantly increased sales in our Ion Torrent platform driven by Ion Proton System sales and continued strong demand for the Ion PGM, as well as growth in Forensics and Research Consumables drove the 1.4% increase.", "Recall that this growth rate includes overcoming headwinds from the decline in sales of our SOLiD 5500 instruments. Our non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.92, ahead of our guidance due to slightly higher sales, higher-than-forecasted gross and operating margins and the benefit of a lower share count, as we continue to aggressively repurchase shares. Overall, our end markets remain largely in line with our expectations.", "In the U.S. and Europe, we continue to see a cautious but stable environment. Last quarter, we guided to growth in Europe of low single digits, which is generally what we saw in the third quarter with growth coming in at 2%. We saw a strength in Asia-Pacific and Japan, as well as our emerging markets where we continue to expand our operations.", "China continues to be a growth market for us, as we continue to invest there on multiple fronts, including expanding our operational capabilities. We completed the acquisition of Genewindows, Life's distributor, covering mainly the Invitrogen brand reagent portfolio in South and West China. This acquisition complements our go-direct strategy for consumables in mainland China. We also expanded our footprint with the completion of our state-of-the-art facility in Beijing, where we will manufacture advanced DNA testing solutions locally to help Forensics labs and law enforcement agencies solve crimes more cost effectively.", "Finally, we entered into a strategic partnership with Sino Biological, a leading Chinese biotechnology company and one of the largest cDNA recombinant protein and antibody product manufacturers and suppliers to biomedical and pharmaceutical research in the world. They have developed the capability to produce over 1,000 new recombinant protein bolts [ph] per year in house and have commercialized more than 10,000 products. Through this partnership, we will distribute Sino Biological's broad portfolio of products and jointly develop new proteomic products for additional obligations.", "During the quarter, we continued to execute on our development pipeline with product launches across several of our businesses, including the Ion Proton System, the PI Chip and the Pervenio lung cancer test I mentioned earlier. In addition to these launches in our Genetic Analysis and Medical Sciences businesses, we also launched GlobalFiler and GlobalFiler Express in our Forensics business.", "These 2 new DNA kits are revolutionizing how crime labs perform forensic testing around the world, making it faster, easier and cheaper to process DNA samples. By increasing the number of genetic markers by over 30%, GlobalFiler delivers the ability to recover significantly more information from forensic samples and increases discrimination power, resulting in faster and more powerful comparisons of forensic data to resolve crimes.", "To date, 44 countries have now implemented criminal offender DNA database programs, with a combined offender sample pool of 40 million and growing. On our last quarterly call, Ronnie Andrews joined us to talk about his vision for our Medical Sciences business. Since that time, we've continued to make progress.", "Earlier in October, we announced our acquisition of Compendia Bioscience, which will enable deeper engagement with an established customer base at leading pharmaceutical companies and will position Life as a partner of choice for drug and companion diagnostic development. Coupled with Navigenics and Pinpoint Genomics, tuck-in acquisitions in July, Compendia completes the foundation of our oncology strategy and positions Life to drive personalized medicine.", "In combining these assets, we are now able to extend a full range of clinical capabilities by developing high-value, proprietary content design and validation through the CLIA lab, delivering interpretation through informatics and ultimately impacting clinical insights through our physician portal. Compendia's oncology workflow can also be incorporated with the Ion Reporter software to enable our Ion customers with robust bioinformatics solutions for early phase clinical research.", "In addition to acquisitions, we entered into 2 partnerships that will help us build diagnostic content. We entered into our second agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb for current and future companion diagnostic projects, covering an initial project for oncology and providing a long-term partnership across a potentially broad range of life instrument platforms and a wide range of therapeutic areas.", "The pharmaceutical industry is increasingly turning its focus to discovering and delivering targeted personalized medications. As more and more targets -- targeted drugs come on to the market in the next decade, there will be a growing need for diagnostics that can help predict which patients will benefit from which drugs. For oncology alone, hundreds of agents are currently in clinical trials, and we can see an extremely strong market opportunity for the development of companion diagnostics.", "We're also working to bring next-generation sequencing into the clinical market and recently signed a nonexclusive license and supply agreement with VelaDx to develop clinical diagnostic tests on Ion PGM for oncology and virology. VelaDx is a privately funded company, led by management team with extensive experience in the pharmaceutical and diagnostic arenas. Under the terms of the agreement, VelaDx will utilize the PGM platform with their Sentosa workflow and their menu of molecular diagnostic tests. They will pursue FDA approval for their systems and kits, which are already in conformance with CE IVD regulations.", "The success of the clinical PGM platform, as is the case for most diagnostic platforms, will rely in part on the existence of a menu of tests that have high value in the market. We continue to seek our partners who are interested in helping us ensure that such a menu exists in multiple areas of clinical importance.", "Progress across our Ion semiconductor sequencing platform accelerated significantly during the quarter. We made improvements to the PGM and AmpliSeq product lines, including the launch of a 400-base pair sequencing kit and Torrent software, launched our new Ion Proton system and introduced several new additions to the technology road map, including Avalanche, an emulsion-free template preparation chemistry that will work on all Ion platforms and also allows us to bring a third chip to the Proton series, which we are now calling the PIII chip.", "We believe the Proton system is a real game changer as it truly opens up the market to affordable clinical exomes and genomes. The PIII chip brings with it new low cost and will make routine genome testing ordinary.", "In mid-September, we hosted our first annual Ion World Customer Conference, which was a resounding success, with over 10 customer talks characterizing our competitive advantages and 450 customers in attendance providing positive feedback and indicating an interest in the Ion platform. The road map we presented at Ion World shows that semiconductor sequencing technology continues to scale in every respect, and the scientists who shared their work at the event confirmed the system's relentless performance gains.", "Ion Torrent has emerged as the most outstanding value in sequencing. In just less than 2 years, read-length has gone from 100 to 400 base pairs and accuracy has improved from Q17 to Q30. Over the same period, the per-run throughput of semiconductor sequencing technology has increased a thousandfold, from 10 mega bases to 10 giga bases, delivering an approximately 5 hundredfold reduction in the sequencing cost per base to the user.", "These improvements now enable any sequencing application, from targeted resequencing and microbial sequencing, to exome sequencing and transcriptome sequencing and many others. Given today's limited capital budgets, we are making it even easier for scientists to make a long-term investment in a technology that will outperform their legacy system today and scale to exponentially greater throughput over time.", "We began shipping our Ion Proton system and the PI chip in September. We shipped over 100 systems in the third quarter. We are extremely pleased with the level of customer interest. The latent demand for Proton is more significant than we originally anticipated. The overall cost of the capital purchase, the ongoing service costs and run costs of traditional NGS instruments have significantly limited the number of research and clinical labs from participating in these markets directly.", "We are also receiving positive feedback from our early customers as they get up and running on Proton system. Several of our customers will be presenting data publicly over the next several weeks. These customers are getting over 10 giga bases in 2- to 3-hour runs, with 80 million reads, which is at the high end of the range we communicated and has a fourfold advantage over other bench top sequencers.", "Proton, using the PI chip, is the only bench top sequencer enabling whole exome and whole transcriptome analysis today. And with the PII chip, it will enable whole genome analysis. Enabling these speeds will make the Proton system transformational for medicine, hospitals and testing laboratories and will truly democratize genome sequencing and bring it into the routine clinical testing.", "At Ion World, we announced we would be introducing 2 new automated templates preparation instruments, the Ion OneTouch 2 System and the Ion Chef System. The Ion OneTouch 2 system is ideal for labs with a Proton and media throughput requirements, while the Ion Chef system is ideal for labs with any level of molecular biology expertise or for labs with high throughput requirements. It automates the upfront sequencing workflow, going from library to loaded chips with just minutes of hands-on time and it's scheduled to ship in the first half of next year. Ion Chef further simplifies sample prep workflow and offers twice the productivity. Designed to support multiple Ion platforms, it can process either 2 PGM chips or 2 Proton chips per run with minutes of hands-on time.", "During the quarter, our business continued to generate strong free cash flow of $177 million. At the beginning of the year, we communicated our commitment to a balanced capital deployment approach where 50% of our available free cash flow would be returned to shareholders. To that end, during the third quarter, we spent an additional $208 million to repurchase shares, bringing our year-to-date total spend on share repurchases to $535 million, more than exceeding that goal.", "We have an additional $612 million remaining under our $750 million share repurchase program. The market dynamics we saw in the third quarter were largely as we expected with strong growth in the emerging markets and slower growth in mature markets like the United States and Europe. We continue to see the broader macro slowdown negatively affecting our European results, and in the U.S., we are now seeing some pullback in spending, as awareness of potential cuts to the NIH become more widespread.", "While we have remain optimistic that Congress and the President will do the responsible thing and reach a bipartisan deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, we are also prepared if they don't. The main point is that in this period of uncertainty, we, like others in this industry, have limited visibility to what impacts political decisions will have on the purchasing patterns of our U.S. research customers.", "Based on these dynamics, we expect our organic revenue growth in 2012 to be at 2% and could be slightly below that level if uncertainty around a debt deal increases in the U.S. market between now and the end of the fourth quarter. We continue to look for ways to reduce our operating costs including pulling back in some areas of discretionary spending in the fourth quarter.", "Assuming the benefit of these spending reductions, a potential pickup from improved currency rates and the lower share count resulting from capital allocation commitments we are executing on, we are increasing the low end of our EPS range by $0.05 to $3.95 and maintaining the top end of the range at $4. We continue to do our best to navigate through these uncertain times and remain committed to further diversifying our end market exposure. We are continuing to make investments in markets where we believe we have the growth opportunities that will make us increasingly more competitive and vibrant in 2013 and 2014.", "And with that, I'll turn it over to David.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I will provide an overview of our results for the third quarter and a more detailed commentary around our expectations for the fourth quarter and the full year.", "As Greg mentioned, we delivered third quarter revenue and earnings growth ahead of our internal expectations. Revenues of $911 million grew 1.4% year-over-year, excluding the impact of currency and were above the high end of the range of $900 million to $910 million we provided in July.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $0.92, ahead of the previous guidance range of $0.87 to $0.90, primarily due to a solid operational performance and the benefit of a lower share count as we continued to repurchase shares. Our free cash flow for the quarter totaled $177 million. At a more detailed level, revenue, excluding currency by region, was as follows: the Americas declined 1%, Europe grew 2%, Asia-Pacific grew 10%, and Japan grew 4%.", "Taking a closer look at our business group results for the quarter. Research Consumables revenue decreased 3% to $384 million. Excluding currency, revenue increased 1% over the same period last year, driven by growth in our cell culture products, sample prep products and bench top instruments. Revenue for Genetic Analysis decreased 1% to $353 million for the third quarter compared to prior year.", "Excluding currency, revenue increased by 2%. The growth was primarily due to a significant step up in Ion Torrent instrument sales, as we launched the Ion Proton System late in September, and continued strong demand for the Ion PGM instruments and consumables. Offsetting some of this revenue growth was the expected headwind from SOLiD instrument sales and the decline in CE instruments, primarily due to one-time orders in the prior year quarter and the timing of some sales.", "While we had expected qPCR royalties to decline by approximately $7 million to $8 million year-over-year, the actual decrease was about $3 million as our team was able to offset declines with additional royalty licensing programs. Applied Sciences revenue was flat, at $174 million for the third quarter compared to prior year. Excluding currency, Applied Sciences grew 3%. The increase was driven primarily by higher forensic kit sales and qPCR Applied Sciences instruments.", "This increase was partially offset by lower sales of CE instruments due to one-time orders in the prior year quarter and an expected decline in BioProduction sales, which tend to fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Gross margin decreased 50 basis points to 65.6% compared to prior year, driven by the impact of unfavorable currency and an increase in Ion Torrent instruments, partially offset by lower SOLiD 5500 instrument sales.", "On a sequential basis, gross margin was in line with the second quarter. Operating expenses of $343 million were $3 million higher on a year-over-year basis, principally due to our continued investment in Greater China and Medical Sciences. On a sequential basis, operating expenses were down as expected, due to our continued management of discretionary costs.", "Our operating profit totaled $255 million, a decrease of 7% over prior year. Third quarter operating margin was 28%, representing a decrease of 140 basis points. The decrease from the prior year was the result of lower gross margins and the higher operating expenses that I just discussed.", "In terms of other income line items, we had $400,000 of interest income, a loss of $2.8 million on foreign exchange and other items and interest expense of $29 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.3%, slightly lower than the second quarter rate of 27.6%.", "Our diluted share count for the quarter was 177.3 million, a decrease of 9.6 million over the prior year, as we continued to repurchase shares as part of our overall capital deployment strategy. In Q3, we repurchased approximately 4.4 million shares for $208 million, and now have $612 million remaining on our current share repurchase authorization.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. We are ending -- our ending cash and short-term investments were $299 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $303 million. Cash from operating activities was $197 million. Capital expenditures were $20 million, and free cash flow was $177 million.", "Return on invested capital was approximately 9% for the quarter. Our ending debt as of September 30 was approximately $2.5 billion. This balance is made up of our senior notes of $2.3 billion plus some short-term debt. We expect to end the year within our target leverage range of 2.0x to 2.5x EBITDA.", "Now let me take a moment and talk about our outlook for the rest of 2012. As Greg said, we expect our revenue growth, excluding currency for the year, to be approximately 2%. Our intention is to offset any additional macroeconomic pressures through continued reductions in discretionary spending. As a result of these initiatives, we continued to expect our operating margin to expand in a range of 25 to 50 basis points for the year.", "Given our additional share repurchases in Q3, we're now expecting our full year share count to be in the range of 179 million to 180 million, down from the 180 million to 182 million we'd previously guided to. We expect our tax rate to be about 27.5% for the full year, assuming the R&D tax credit is reinstated in Q4.", "Taking into account these factors, we are increasing the lower end of our EPS range by $0.05 to $3.95 and maintaining the top end of the range at $4. And now let me provide additional color on the fourth quarter. Gross margins are expected to be up year-over-year, largely due to manufacturing productivity related to savings in material cost and lower inventory write-offs than last year, partially offset by lower royalty revenue and higher instrument sales.", "Our operating expenses are expected to be up year-over-year, as we continue to invest in Medical Sciences, partially offset by a reduction in discretionary spending. Currency has fluctuated considerably from month-to-month and continues to be highly variable.", "Net of the hedge benefit, currency at September month-end rates could negatively impact revenue by $11 million and EPS by a couple of pennies for the fourth quarter. Given these assumptions, we expect Q4 EPS to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.13. Those of you who saw our press release may have noticed that we had a section in there about subsequent litigation, and let me comment on that.", "About an hour prior to our earnings call, we received an unfavorable verdict in our litigation with Enzo Biochem relating to CE sequencing projects during the period 1998 to 2004. The relevant patent expired in 2004 prior to the acquisition of AB, so the verdict does not have any impact on our CE business going forward. The jury ruled that Life Technologies had infringed Enzo's intellectual property relating to reagent sales and gave a verdict in the amount of $48.5 million in favor of Enzo.", "As a result of today's verdict, we will record a GAAP-only expense of $48.5 million for the third quarter ended September 30, 2012. This will result in a reduction of GAAP net income of approximately $31.5 million, or $0.18 per diluted share. The current financial tables in our press release filed today do not reflect this expense, but we intend to file updated financial tables in an amended Form 8-K in the next 2 business days.", "As you recall, we had a similar situation with our litigation against Promega earlier this year, where the jury ruled against us. We appealed, and subsequently, the verdict was overruled. While we can't predict the outcome of litigation, we strongly disagree with the Enzo verdict and intend to vigorously challenge it in the trial court and on appeal.", "And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Carol.", "Carol A. Cox", "Great. Thanks, David. And, Jonathan, we'll open up the call now to questions and answers. [Operator Instructions]", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Greg, if I can just focus on the top line for a second, you mentioned a lot of the -- obviously the uncertainty out there and some of the headwinds. If we think about -- one of the issues this year was obviously the fall off in SOLiD. Can you maybe talk a little bit how you're feeling with respect to Ion? You made a number of announcements obviously, that you went over again on the call here, but maybe what you're seeing in terms of Proton demand? A little -- maybe any more detail you're willing to provide and maybe how you think that translates into early next year? And then maybe also there's been a lot of questions around emerging markets. If you could maybe just kind of comment a little bit around what you're seeing maybe in China and emerging markets.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. Thanks, Jon, for the question. We're very positive of the Ion Torrent franchise. You've seen, just in the last 90 days, pardon the pun, a torrent of new product launches with the PI chip, the announcement of the PIII chip, entirely new sample preparation instruments, as well as chemistries, and an increasing uptake of the AmpliSeq panels being used in translational research. So we're very pleased with how this franchise just continues to grow, and it's tracking the original deal model when we acquired Ion Torrent about 2 years ago. So as we look to 2013, we see another, just phenomenal year of growth of this franchise and because of these new product launches, because of a build out of more focused sales teams now to call on laboratories that are doing translational research, we think that we'll have, again, another just banner year of sales growth. Maybe turning our attention then to your second question of emerging markets. I think you can see our strategy playing out is that as we see this research reagents and instruments industry mature and consolidate, our goal is to vertically integrate ever more forward into our distributors in countries where we're seeing really strong growth. Every time that we do that, we can have more direct conversations with scientists. We broaden the available products we sell, and we just have faster growth, and so we're staying the course. We like our strategy. We're investing where the growth is, and we think that ultimately this industry centers around just a couple of big players, and we're certainly going to be one of them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amanda Murphy from JPMorgan -- I'm sorry, from William Blair.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "[Audio Gap]", "business, so I think this is discussed last quarter as well, that you've been running at that 1% run rate. So -- and obviously, there's uncertainties around funding, but how are you thinking about that, that business next year and longer term? Is it fair to say there's some pent up demand there, or do you think you can drive that growth back up to what is a more normal run rate?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I'm sorry, Amanda, your -- the first part of your question got cut off. So if you could repeat the first part?", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I'm sorry. I was just asking about the underlying consumables business and just the growth rates there. Obviously, there's a lot of uncertainty for the rest of this year, but I was curious how you're thinking about that for the longer term. It's been running at that 1% sort of growth rate. Is this something where we can think about pent-up demand next year, when we're passed all the uncertainties? Or what's the right sustainable growth rate for just as a base underlying consumables business?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. So let's look at that question maybe by geographical split. So in Europe, you have seen the industry, just due to the external market demand ease down to that lower single digits, and we think, at least in the next year, that's about where it's going to remain. If we go over to Asia and the emerging markets like Middle East and South America, we're seeing much more robust growth for those consumables, and so we think actually that continues to grow at a nice pace in 2013. So the real question mark then of your question is the United States and what happens. And clearly we've seen this moderation of demand in 2012 due to all the uncertainties coming out of Washington, D.C. Look, our hope is that this thing settles out here between now and hopefully the beginning of the year and that we enter into 2013 in the United States with more reasonable, consistent demand going forward. Certainly, that's what all the universities, research institutes want. And at least we're hopeful that smart minds and mature minds prevail in Washington to bring about some certainty here in government funding. So we'll have to see, but our hope here is that the United States returns to a little bit better growth, in which case I think you'll see us move up from that 1% growth that we've experienced this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "As we think about guidance and what you're implying here for the fourth quarter, you are calling for a nice acceleration then, Greg, you talked about the backdrop getting a little bit more difficult heading into the fiscal cliff. So can you talk about what gives you conviction in maybe 4% growth or so off a more difficult comp? Is that all Proton or are there other factors there?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Let me take that one, Tycho. This is David. There are a couple of things in there. Certainly Proton and PGM are both important factors. They continue to accelerate. And absent some significant change in the macroeconomic environment, we think that growth will continue. Second, BioProduction was down in the third quarter. We think that will come back to growth in the fourth quarter. And then finally, we have some new products that we're introducing in Research Consumables, and we think there'll be a step up there. And then finally, as we talked about in the third quarter, there are a number of large deals in Forensics that we expect will close in the fourth quarter. So it's basically those 4 things.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, and if I could just squeeze in one quick follow-on. Can you comment on the LabCorp announcement today? Just curious if you wanted to say anything.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "We're well aware of that litigation. We're -- think it's baseless, and we'll defend our position vigorously.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Admittedly, this is perhaps beating a dead horse here, Greg, but I just wanted to think a little bit about your comments regarding the slowdown. Can you talk to us -- is this -- I guess how recently have you seen this? Is this perhaps related at all to the election? Or do you think this is everything to do with the impending fiscal cliff? And assuming that, as you mentioned, clear heads in Washington prevail, that we'll get that ship righted?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I don't have any more insights than what I said. I think what you've heard from the corporation then is that we're really clear eyed about what's happening here around us once the election gets settled and the work gets underway to avoid the fiscal cliff. And based on all that mix, we're still improving the bottom end of our guidance. And as David answered, we're expecting actually a better organic growth in the fourth quarter because of some factors that are unique to us. So all of that gamish [ph] together produces the earnings per share that we're forecasting right now.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division", "Got it. And if I could sneak in a quick follow-up to David. Just thinking about the better-than-expected RT-PCR royalties in the third quarter, should we expect that to roll into the fourth and into 2013 as well?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "No, for the fourth quarter, we expect our royalties, qPCR royalties, to be at down around $10 million.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler from Barclays.", "Charles Anthony Butler - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "Greg, I appreciate the amalgamation of diagnostic assets that you put together, but you've launched a really interesting lung cancer test in the quarter, and I remember what Ron Andrews said in the previous quarter. But can you actually -- what I didn't exactly get from his discussion and now that this has been launched, what's the actual go-to-market strategy here? Can you tell me -- or are you actually going directly to physicians and are they then therefore ordering, or is there some other method? And then the second question, perhaps more for David, is Japan obviously strong. I understand the weak comp, but sequentially, seem to look better. Is there something going on there that was unusual in this quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. So with the Pervenio Lung Cancer test, it is the first of a broader menu in lung cancer that is going to be emerging from the company. And because of that, we have invested in building already here in the third quarter, we think, an extremely experienced channel direct sales force to start calling on those surgeons that are doing this type of work. We're going to be doing the testing initially in the old Navigenics CLIA lab, but ultimately our goal is to seek an IVD approval for that test and then democratize it in a kit form on our instruments worldwide. So that's the strategy, is to go direct, and again we're extremely excited that, as you'll see, this is the first of a broader menu to really focus in on lung cancer. Maybe just I'll take the second part of your question, and David can complement it, but our Japanese business is extremely well managed. It just continues to do well in what is essentially a flat economy over there, and so I don't think there's anything extraordinary in Japan per se other than just some good performance. But, David, maybe you want to add a little more color to it?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "No, that's absolutely right. I mean, Ion sales were strong. Forensics was strong, offset by lower SOLiD sales. But if you look at the previous quarters, Q2 was 2%. Q3 was 4%, and we grew again around 4% this quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "It's Derik. So I'm curious, you said you shipped 100 Protons during the quarter. So how much of those are recognized as sales? And I'm just curious in the ASP and just overall on what the backlog is on the Proton.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, let me comment on how many were recognized in terms of revenue, and then Mark can comment on the pipeline and what we see for Q4. Basically all of them were recognized, when shipped. We went through the same process that we went through on SOLiD and the PGM to establish installation as being basically perfunctory, and so we recognize revenue upon shipment.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "And we did go into the fourth quarter here -- this is Mark, Tycho, with a backlog of instruments that we'll ship. And we're now installing those instruments and getting them up and going and working through that backlog. It was a large bolus of shipments we obviously shipped to the end of the quarter, and now our service and support team is preparing for labs and getting ready. And some of these early customers who had their instrument installed will be presenting data next week at the American Society of Human Genetics.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "And then the final part of your question was what the average selling price was, and it was roughly $200,000.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "$200,000. Okay, all right. And I guess I'm going to sneak in one final one since Mark called me Tycho, I'm going to sneak in another one. That's okay, I'm better looking than Tycho. On the M&A deal that you've done recently, how do we look at the revenues from those going forward, and how do we -- suppose to think about them, I mean, was there any contribution from revenue this quarter on -- from the M&A deals, and how do we sort of -- I'm just curious on how do we model that?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes. So there was really no revenue at all from any of those acquisitions in the quarter and de minimis revenue even in the fourth quarter from these deals. If anything, we're absorbing the additional cost structure to be investing into this oncology franchise that we're building out.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I was hoping you could comment on what you're seeing from the pharma and biotech end market? What are you seeing for demand and pricing? And just if I could sneak in another one. Any impact you've seen from Sandy? I know it's early.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "On the first one, the pharmaceutical/biotech field is mixed. It's a bit better than the academic environment, but I think when you answer the question you've got to go more account by account and understand the dynamics at each one. So it's a stable demand, it's better than academia. And in that customer subsegment, the biotech is even better than the big pharma. On Sandy, I would just say it's probably too soon to tell in terms of what impact it'll have at all on the quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan from Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Maybe just on Proton. Maybe just some more color about maybe the types of customers, if you could give us some insight there? Researchers, clinical, maybe kind of big centers versus smaller, and then related to that the company's ability to scale to meet the anticipated demand.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes. So with regard to the distribution of customers, it really was a mixture of customers. I would say the majority went into smaller sort of academic labs getting up and going. There was a relative proportion went into the clinical labs. It's roughly about the same breakdown as we've had in PGM. So I would say about 20% to 30% of that is going into our clinical segment, and the rest into research at this point. We are very well set up in terms of the demand in terms of building the instrument. We are, as I mentioned, working through the backlog. It's just a large number of labs that now we've shipped to that we need to just work through that backlog to get customers set up in their labs and set up and running. And we're working through that as we go through this quarter.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "And any color on whether some of the placements are competitive or you -- in terms of in a lot of the smaller labs, maybe this is the democratization you're just -- it's kind of greenfield. But I'm just wondering, is there any breakdown between where there was a competitive win versus a lab that didn't have any sequencing before?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "No, we're certainly seeing competitive in all of the sales. Everyone's comparing ourselves and the competitor, and we're coming out well in terms of what we know we're strong on, which is the speed of the turnaround of the assay. The [indiscernible] scalability to scale up and get an exome done there in Proton in a couple of hours. And then just the price for data point. A lot of these labs just don't have the cost of the infrastructure to invest in bigger capital instruments. And so the price point that we have in the Proton just opens up this market to be democratized.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Shaun Rodriguez from Cowen and Company.", "Shaun Rodriguez - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "On the Q2 call in the context of your third quarter and full year guidance, at that time you were targeting about 4% organic growth in the fourth quarter with, I believe, the 2 key drivers being Ion and particular Applied Science orders. So you had a bigger Applied Science third quarter than at least we expected. So I just wanted to know if those particular Applied Science orders are still expected in Q4, or whether some of those might have come in earlier than you originally intended.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "We do still expect the orders in Q4, and we did close some deals in the third quarter. But we expect approximately the deals that we are anticipating in the fourth quarter remain essentially the same.", "Shaun Rodriguez - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And one more quick one, if you could talk about how utilization is trending on PGM and here I'm thinking more among your earlier adopters and whether you're seeing the launch of Proton have a material impact on PGM.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "We're not seeing the launch of Proton have any impact on the consumption of PGM. In fact, what we're generally seeing is an increased uptick in the consumables, particularly as we worked through -- we're now introducing the improved sample prep, the OneTouch. We've improved the informatics Ion Torrent reporter. So those are really the main drivers of then increased chip and consumable usage. So we're seeing a good demand and then we've added on to that the new AmpliSeq chemistry. And so that's seen a considerable uptake for us in just demand for customers running panels on their PGM. So we see a good uptake on that, and that's really a separate market to what people will run in their protons, which will be exomes.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard from Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I'll try to squeeze 2 questions into one. Hoping you could give us an update on your progress on installing the Protons you shipped. And then secondly, appreciate the color on the Ion Chef. Wondering if you could offer us some color on feedback on the OneTouch version 2.0 and what gets customers incrementally excited about that or where the differences lie between the first version?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. So I'll take the first part. Mark will take the Ion Chef. In terms of our installation schedule, as Mark had said earlier, we have a very methodical schedule between now and the end of the quarter to get all of our installs up and running. We have followed, in the first couple of weeks, a very, I think, focused strategy on a few customers to start, and you'll actually be seeing some of their results at the ASHG conference next week, where they're getting record output of the Proton device. So we're extremely pleased with how it has been installed, how it's scaling up and now how we're moving out in terms of faster installation across all those customers that got the instruments. Mark, I'll defer to you in terms of that and Ion Chef.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "So in terms of the OneTouch 2 specifically we had very good feedback on that. We've made a number of improvements on the system as we launched the OneTouch 2, which is the sample prep for the Proton, and we've also made available upgrades for the OneTouch existing system for our PGM customers. So good improvement on that, and then the Ion Chef, which we unveiled on our road map, will be available in the mid-half of next year. And really that allows us to automate, as customers get to even higher throughput or want to automate further that sample prep load and completely walk away from those 2 chips. That allows them that flexibility in automation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Just want to, David, ask a quick accounting question about the FX. I think you gave the net number on the impact of the P&L, but I was wondering if you could maybe help us walk through the impact through the various OpEx items, so we model this right going forward.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "I'm not sure -- that's probably a question better handled offline. Not sure I understand exactly what you're trying to get at, but it's probably too much detail to take everyone else through.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Well, if I could clarify, I want to make sure there are no significant items this quarter that were sort of a function of FX, either through SG&A or R&D, that we should be aware of as we model those items going forward.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "No, there's no change -- there is no difference in the way FX would impact our expenses this quarter than have been in the previous quarters.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group.", "Vijay Kumar - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "This is Vijay for Ross. I had one in -- your assumptions on price capture heading into fourth quarter and '13 for the base consumable business given the tightening budgets, sort of what are your thoughts around price capture?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, maybe the best way to answer that question is looking forward into 2013. I mean, 2012 is basically done at this point. So as we look to 2013, we're expecting that the industry structure, which allows a couple points of price to continue to be the norm, and we'll be announcing price changes in the first quarter of next year accordingly.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Vamil Divan from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So just sort of similar to the question I think Amanda asked earlier on the consumables side, just in terms of the GA business, I'm trying to get a sense of how you guys view sort of the longer term growth rates there, not so much for the fourth quarter but looking into next year and even beyond if you want to say anything given the uptake we're seeing from PGM and Proton. And then I guess my second question, which is somewhat related, I know you've talked about seeking FDA clearance for PGM this year. Just how long you think that process will take just given the -- we don't really have great clarity from the FDA at this point in terms of what they're looking for and kind of how you envision the timing going in terms of getting final clearance.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "It's Mark. I'll tell you the first part on the Genetic Analysis. I mean, really, as we look forward slightly different to the research consumables where it's more into the macros. The real driver of growth will be in the Ion Proton, and the rest of the GA portfolio, you'll see, we think, continued stability in our qPCR franchise, which we're the leader in and continue to innovate in that in products that you've seen in ASHG, and you'll continue to see innovation with us next week at ASHG. And then we continue to see, in the research side, modest decline in the CE part, offset by the continued use of CE in validation of clinical samples. With regard to the submission for the Ion Torrent PGM, what we've decided to do is to continue to work and lock down the protocol and the reagents. We really made so much improvement in the read-length and the sample prep. We focused on locking that down to make sure that the system we submit really has a best read-length and accuracy. And we're about to lock that down soon and then we'll prepare and submit our 510(k). It's unknown towards the exact time it will take. And just from previous experiences of the 510(k) process, that could be anywhere from 6 months to 12.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. I guess one follow-up, just on that. Have they given any sort of guidance, just talking to the clinical customers, they like when things are obviously locked down and stable, and obviously the FDA likes that too, but just the fact that you're making these updates so rapidly. Will there be a way to keep up with the updates? Or once you file, are we going to see some sort of gap before we get another approval for an updated platform for a clinical use?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, for the PGM Dx, specifically, we'll lock it down for clinical use. So that's typically what we would do, and then any further updates would improve them. So it will be a system that's validated, and that's also will reduce the number of updates and that's what our clinical customers who are currently either running in a CLIA lab or running outside the U.S. in a regulated environment, that's what we'll do for those customers.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Bryan Brokmeier from Maxim Group.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division", "A little bit into the backlog, which you commented on earlier, of the backlog of the Ion Proton. Would you expect -- with backlog you ended with, or where you are right now and with ASHG coming up in your expectations for the number of orders that you'll receive there, do you anticipate a sequential increase in Ion Proton shipments in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Maxim Group LLC, Research Division", "Any -- and I guess just a little bit more on that is, how should we sort of think about the consumable pull through and the ramp of that for the overall PGM business, particularly now with the Ion Proton install base?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Well, I think we're still -- we have no reason to go away from our original assumption in terms of what the PGM usage has been. We're currently somewhere around $50,000 per year per PGM. What our original assumption was that as more and more applications are developed, that would ramp up to around $80,000. And $80,000, basically, is 3 runs per week with a $500 chip.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "[Audio Gap]", "[indiscernible] That still remains a large stumbling block for adoption it seems. What's going on there for Life? And then we've also heard a number of accounts returning Ion Torrent systems. What's happening there?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, Peter, the first part of your question got cut off. So what were you saying is the stumbling block?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Bioinformatics, just the fact that there's this extensive buildout that MiSeq and HiSeq have had for the bioinformatics side of things. Just wonder what's going on inside Life helping support customers?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, let me take the second part first, which is this kind of urban legend that there's a bunch of returns of Ion Torrent. I think that would be completely erroneous. And in fact, that would be negligible at best, if any. So I think analysts have focused on that, but I think that is misinformation. On the first part about bioinformatics, Mark, maybe you could talk a little more at length on that?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "We've heavily invested in 2 aspects I would say. One we've essentially put the server for the genome center in the box. So when you get a Proton, you've actually got all the IT system and the reader board and everything is on the latest electronics. So that's a major change, and then the second investment is to make it easy in the interpretation through the Ion suite and the Ion Reporter. We have a large set of informatics tools that help people take, say, for example, the cancer panel that we've done all the way through to read that out to do their clinical research. So that's a big investment that we've made to make it simple. The third part we're doing is enabling the Ion community. So third party plug-in softwares can enable. That maybe include plug-in softwares now like the Compendia that Greg mentioned earlier, but also other third-party tools plug into that.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And Greg, so you've seen returns, but they're of low number?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "I would clarify, we've seen no returns.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "No returns. Complete misinformation.", "Carol A. Cox", "Jonathan, do we have any more questions? Or is that everyone?", "Operator", "This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program.", "Carol A. Cox", "All right. Great. Well, thank you, everyone.

On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until March 1 this year. A copy of the press release of our 2012 fourth quarter and full year earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2012 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information. So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. I'm glad you could join us today for our 2012 fourth quarter, and year-end earnings call. I've been looking forward to this call because we're reporting another great quarter and a strong finish to what has turned out to be an outstanding year for us. I'm very proud of what our team has accomplished in 2012 in spite of the challenging environment. It reinforces to me that our team is second to none and our position as the global industry leader is only getting stronger. We have a proven strategy, a sound operating plan and a well-executed -- and we executed well to deliver record revenue and adjusted EPS performance. This morning, I'll cover the Q4 financial highlights first, discuss what we saw in our end markets, then get into what I consider to be our key takeaways for the year. I'll wrap up by setting the stage for 2013 with our annual guidance.", "So turning to the quarter. As you read in our press release, we continued our trend of consistently delivering strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth. We set a Q4 record with a 14% increase in adjusted EPS. Revenue for the quarter was also a record, growing 6% year-over-year. And we achieved a 7% increase in our adjusted operating income and operating margin of 19.6%. So thanks to the strong execution by our teams, we were able to deliver another excellent quarter. Now let me take a few minutes to put our performance in the context of our 4 primary end markets.", "I'll start with pharma and biotech, which continues to be our strongest end market. I'm pleased to report that the excellent momentum we've had all year carried into Q4, with growth in the high single digits. Our BioProcess Production and clinical trials logistics businesses stood out again this quarter. And in general, we're really executing well commercially to leverage our capabilities across the company for our biopharma customers. Our value proposition is making a difference for these customers, and it's pretty clear from our top line performance that we continue to gain share.", "In health care and diagnostics, we delivered a good quarter, with our Specialty Diagnostics businesses generating mid-single-digit growth. We continued to see strong demand for our biomarker test and clinical diagnostic products as we have all year and we also benefited from the strong flu season. Another dynamic worth noting geographically, we're leveraging our extensive presence in the Asia-Pacific to meet the growing needs for the health care in that region, and we're starting to see the benefit there.", "Turning to academic and government, market conditions played out pretty much as we expected, resulting in a slight decline in Q4 versus the prior year. As we've seen all year long, growth here was muted due to the uncertain funding environment. Until our customers have a clearer view of how this may unfold, their spending on capital equipment will continue to be constrained while purchases of laboratory consumables will be less effective.", "Last, industrial and applied markets' demand was soft overall, similar to what we saw in Q3. And that has led to growth in the low single digits. Some of our industrial customers appear to be delaying purchase decisions in the current environment, and we're planning for that to continue. In applied markets, however, we're still seeing pockets of strength, including high demand for our air quality and particulate monitors in China, as an example.", "So in summary, no dramatic changes compared to previous quarters in terms of market demand and our strong performance overall underscores how well we're navigating the environment. Now let's turn to our results for the full year, starting with what I consider to be our most significant accomplishment.", "We had record adjusted EPS for the year, growing 19% over 2011. Our revenue was also a record. We grew by 8%, to $12.5 billion. We expanded our adjusted operating margin for the full year by 60 basis points and we did that while investing for a bright future by strengthening our R&D pipeline, commercial capabilities and our presence in emerging markets. Last, we had a record year for free cash flow, generating $1.77 billion in 2012.", "We were able to achieve our goals for the year even in a challenging environment because we have a proven strategy that leverages all of our strengths as a company to consistently generate strong EPS growth. You've heard me say this many times, but the key drivers of our EPS performance are: top line growth, margin expansion and effective capital deployment. I'll use these as a framework to highlight what I believe are the key takeaways from 2012.", "First, top line growth. As I said earlier, this is driven by innovation, commercial excellence and emerging markets. 2012 was a banner year for innovation. We launched significant new Thermo Scientific products at the major global industry conferences across our key technology platforms. Many of the names should be familiar by now: the iCAP Q, iS50, TRACE 1300, TSQ 8000, TruNarc, LYNX superspeed, PikoReal, Indiko Plus. We've highlighted them throughout the year, and then a few weeks ago at an investor conference, so I won't list them all. But the key takeaway is I can't remember a time when we've had such a significant lineup of new technologies. I think this speaks to our commitment to innovation, our ability to partner with our customers to develop the right solutions and our expertise in turning our ideas into commercial successes.", "A little side note. We held our annual leadership meeting during the first week of January with our top 260 employees in the company. This is how we always kick off the year and align our key goals and priorities. One of the highlights of the meeting is our awards ceremony, which includes our most prestigious honor, the George Hatsopoulos Award for Technical Innovation, named after one of our founders.", "We actually had a break from tradition this year by granting 2 awards: one, for the inventor of our FirstDefender portable chemical analyzer; the other went to the team that developed our Q Exactive mass spec. It was really inspiring to see the commitment and passion that led to this technology breakthrough. Since the launch of the Q Exactive, we've built a $100 million plus business in the Q-TOF market, a segment where we previously didn't compete.", "So 2012 was a terrific year for innovation. And 2013 has the potential to be an even better year based on the new product launches we have planned. I look forward to highlighting those as the year unfolds.", "Our second growth driver is commercial excellence. This is another differentiator for our company. Our teams are doing an excellent job of delivering our value proposition to our customers and is helping us gain share. You can see it in our results. We want our customers to see Thermo Fisher as much more than a supplier. We partner with our customers to help them meet their goals for innovation and productivity by leveraging our capabilities across the company.", "As you know, we've done this a very effectively with our biopharma customers for a number of years, and we've been gaining share. These initiatives are also really resonating in the current environment, and I'm pleased to say that they're attractive to customers in a number of industries, such as contract testing labs, medical device companies and petrochemical companies as well. We're investing to strengthen our commercial capabilities to further capitalize on the many opportunities we see here.", "Our presence in emerging markets, our third key growth driver, is another important differentiator for Thermo Fisher. As you know, we've been investing heavily in the Asia-Pacific region for the past few years, and it's really paying off. Asia-Pacific now represents 17% of our total company revenue, up from 15% a year ago. Given our size, that's a material increase in revenue. Among those countries, China was the standout again this quarter, with 23% growth in Q4 and 22% for the year. Our team there has really delivered. China became our second largest geography by revenue during 2012, with more than $700 million in annual sales. After my most recent visit to China last November, I remain optimistic about our prospects for growth. Between ongoing demand for our environmental instruments, our food safety capabilities and the growth we're experiencing in Specialty Diagnostics, I'm confident that China will continue to be a key growth driver for us.", "Going forward, we'll continue to focus on capturing more opportunities from emerging markets, such as Russia, South Korea and Brazil. Our strategy in these countries is twofold. We're scaling up our commercial presence to go where the growth is. The new demo center we opened in South Korea last year is a good example of that. We're also optimizing our service and support infrastructure, so we can serve our customers more efficiently. We made significant progress in emerging markets and this will continue to be a focus for us in 2013.", "Let me now move from the top line and talk about the second major contributor to our EPS performance, margin expansion. The main point I want to make here is that we were able to deliver good margin expansion in 2012 while continuing to invest for the future. As you know, in addition to the benefits of volume leverage, we have a number of levers that we pull to drive margins. This includes our Practical Process Improvement business system, or PPI, our company-wide sourcing programs and optimizing our global footprint.", "Since late 2011, we've taken restructuring actions to help us navigate the macro environment and have realized significant benefits that we're using to fuel growth. With the economic uncertainty that still exists, we have contingency plans in place across our businesses to further reduce costs if necessary. We're prepared to execute quickly on these plans if the world gets more challenging, so I'm confident in our ability to effectively manage our costs in line with the business environment.", "The third contributor to our strong EPS growth is effective capital deployment, and 2012 was a standout year in that regard as well. We deployed our capital on strategic acquisitions and returned significant capital to our shareholders. We invested $1.1 billion last year on complementary acquisitions.", "I'll highlight the largest, One Lambda, which we completed last September. Through One Lambda, we strengthened our Specialty Diagnostics offering with the addition of the leading portfolio of transplant diagnostic tests. I'll just add here that they had a strong Q4, their first full quarter as part of Thermo Fisher. As I've said previously, One Lambda serves an attractive market, has a very strong market position and we believe will generate a strong return on our invested capital.", "As I mentioned, we also returned $1.3 billion of our capital to our shareholders in 2012 between our stock buybacks and the dividend we initiated early in the year. This was our first dividend in the company's history and was a real vote of confidence from our Board that our company is on the right track. Looking ahead, we remain committed to leveraging our strong cash flow to create shareholder value through disciplined capital deployment.", "I'll now spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2013, as well as our guidance for the year, which Pete will review in more detail. While it is difficult to predict what's going to happen in the world, we're planning for the global economic environment to remain challenging. That said, we feel good about our performance in 2012 and believe that our track record of delivering top line growth, margin expansion and effectively deploying our capital positions us well for 2013. A simple way to think about this is if the environment gets worse than we expect, we'll put our contingency plans into effect right away. If it ends up being better, we're in a great position to quickly capitalize on the opportunities created by a stronger global economy.", "So, turning to our guidance for the year. We're expecting to achieve adjusted EPS in the range of $5.32 to $5.46, which would result in 8% to 11% growth over our record EPS performance in 2012. In terms of the top line, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $12.8 billion to $13.0 billion for 2% to 4% revenue growth year-over-year.", "We had great momentum throughout 2012. Our strategy is clearly working. And by using our depth of capabilities to help our customers succeed, we will gain share. When you combine our value proposition with the power of our PPI business system, operational discipline and effective capital deployment, I'm confident we'll deliver a successful 2013. With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we had a strong Q4, which closed out a great year driven largely by the outstanding operational execution by our teams around the globe. I'm very pleased with our accomplishments this year, given the macro challenges. So I'll start with an overview of our overall financial performance, and then provide some color on each of our 3 segments before moving on to guidance.", "As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of strong top and bottom line results, which led to a 14% increase in adjusted EPS to a fourth quarter record of $1.36. For the full year, adjusted EPS was a record $4.94, up 19% from $4.16 last year. GAAP EPS in Q4 was $1.04, up 35% from $0.70 -- $0.77 in Q4 last year, and $3.21 for the full year, down 7% from $3.46 in 2011, as a result of last year's divestiture gains.", "Looking at the top line, Q4 total revenue increased 6% year-over-year and we delivered 4% organic growth. Q4 reported revenue includes 2% growth from acquisitions and a 1% headwind from FX. Similar to last quarter, the revenue components I had just mentioned do not sum due to rounding.", "For the full year, total revenue increased 8% year-over-year. And on a pro forma basis, as if Dionex and Phadia were owned for all of 2011, reported revenue was up 3% and organic revenue was up 4%. Pro forma revenue growth includes 1% growth from acquisitions other than Dionex and Phadia, which was offset by a 2% headwind from FX. In terms of bookings, we continued to strengthen our backlog, with bookings exceeding revenue by about 1 percentage point in the quarter.", "Moving to geography. We saw growth across all regions in the quarter, as well as for the full year. In Q4, North America and Europe grew in the low single digits and Asia Pac grew in the high single digits, with China coming in very strong once again at over 20% growth. And rest of the world grew in the low double-digits, so very similar to what we've seen all year. And our performance for the year mirrored the quarter, with the only difference being that Rest of the World grew in the mid-single-digits.", "Turning to the bottom line, Q4 adjusted operating income was up 7% and adjusted operating margin was 19.6%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. In addition to the pull-through on our top line growth, we once again had very strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions. For the full year, adjusted operating income was up 12% and adjusted operating margin was 19.0%, up 60 basis points from 2011. This is slightly below our previous full year guidance of about 70 basis points, principally as a result of unfavorable FX in the quarter.", "We continue to realize the benefit of the $100 million restructuring program that we initiated in 2011 and the $75 million program that we initiated in 2012. In total, we realized about $18 million of benefit in Q4 and about $65 million of benefit for the full year from these actions. I'll cover what we expect for 2013 later in my comments when I discuss our guidance. We continued to make strategic investments this quarter, primarily in emerging markets, to enable us to capitalize on our growth momentum and expand our global presence. We also invested in information technology to improve the customer experience and our overall efficiency.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44.7% in Q4, down 10 basis points from the prior year. As I mentioned, we once again delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, which was driven by our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. These benefits were partially offset by foreign exchange, specifically the devaluation of the Japanese yen and unfavorable mix. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 44.5%, up 90 basis points from 2011, driven primarily by acquisitions and strong productivity.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 22.1% of revenue, down 40 basis points from the 2011 quarter as a result of volume leverage and our restructuring actions. For the year, adjusted SG&A was 22.5% of revenue, up 20 basis points from 2011, primarily as a result of acquisitions partially offset by volume leverage and restructuring. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3.0% of revenues, both for the quarter and full year, essentially in line with 2011. As a reminder, R&D as a percentage of manufacturing revenue is over 5%.", "Below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $60 million, which was $9 million above Q4 of last year as a result of the debt we issued in Q3 to fund the One Lambda acquisition. Adjusted other income was $3 million, up about $5 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of increased JV income, investment gains and below-the-line FX. For the full year, net interest expense was $216 million, which was $68 million above 2011 due to the additional debt we have issued to fund the acquisitions of Dionex, Phadia and One Lambda.", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.2%, 250 basis points lower than last year and 200 basis points lower than our guidance as a result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax-planning efforts. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 16.7%, 240 basis points lower than last year for the reasons I just stated.", "As you saw in our press release and as Marc mentioned, we had another significant quarter in terms of returning capital to our shareholders. During Q4 we spent $350 million to buy back 5.7 million shares of our stock. And for the full year, we deployed $1.15 billion to repurchase 20.8 million of our shares. As you know, we initiated a dividend this year and paid out $142 million in dividends to our shareholders during 2012. And in Q4, we also increased our quarterly dividend by 15%, to $0.15 per share. Average diluted shares were 367 -- 361.7 million in the quarter, down 3.7 million from Q3 and down 14 million, or 4%, from last year, reflecting the benefit of our 2011 and 2012 share buyback programs. For the full year, average diluted shares were 366.6 million, down 18 million, or 5%.", "Turning to the cash flow and the balance sheet. We finished the year by delivering the strongest quarterly and full year cash flow in our history. Full year cash flow from continuing operations was $2.07 billion and free cash flow was $1.77 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $300 million. Full year free cash flow was up 24% year-over-year as a result of strong operating income, solid improvements in working capital and lower cash taxes, partially offset by higher capital expenditures and interest expense.", "Driving cash flow is a key focus for our organization and we delivered very strong performance here again in 2012. We ended the year with $855 million in cash and investments, up $19 million from Q3 and our total debt at the end of Q4 was $7.12 billion, down $348 million from Q3 as a result of paying down $350 million of senior notes which matured in the fourth quarter.", "To wrap up the total company section, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on our return on invested capital. As you may recall at our analyst meeting back in May, we said that we expected to report adjusted ROIC in the range of 9.3% to 9.5% for 2012, which did not contemplate our 2012 acquisitions, versus 9.2% in 2011. Our actual adjusted ROIC in 2012 was 9.3%, so within the range we communicated in May, including acquisitions, which indicates the strength of the underlying business.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of each of our 3 business segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies, in Q4, total revenue grew 2% and organic revenue increased 3%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in our BioProcess Production, mass spec and air quality businesses. And this was partially offset by the softness we've been experiencing in some industrial markets. For the year, reported revenue grew 7%. On a pro forma basis, including Dionex in both years, Analytical Technologies revenues increased 3% and organic revenue increased 5%.", "In Q4, adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies decreased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 20%, down 110 basis points. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which was offset by strategic investments, as well as unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange. For all of 2012, adjusted operating income increased 7% and adjusted operating margin was about flat, at 18.7%.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics Segment, in Q4, total revenue grew 12% and organic growth was 6%. For the full year, total revenue grew 20%. And on a pro forma basis, including Phadia in both years, total revenue and organic revenue both grew 4%. Consistent with what we've been -- what we've seen throughout the year, we continued to deliver strong growth in our clinical diagnostics business, including biomarkers. In general, we delivered good growth across this segment and our microbiology and health care market channel businesses benefited from a strong flu season.", "In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment increased 21%, with adjusted operating margin at 25.9%, up 190 basis points from the prior year primarily as a result of volume, pull-through, acquisitions and strong productivity, partially offset by strategic investments. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 27% and adjusted operating margin was 25.7%, up 150 basis points from 2011.", "In the quarter, total revenue in Laboratory Products and Services Segment grew 4% and organic revenue grew 3%. We had good growth in our research market channel and laboratory consumables businesses and our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver strong growth. This was partially offset by continued weakness in our laboratory equipment business. For the full year, both reported and organic growth grew 4%. For the quarter, adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 8% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, up 40 basis points, driven by solid cost productivity. And for the full year, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, flat with the prior year but up 35 basis points in the second half.", "So moving on to our guidance. As you saw in the press release, for 2013 we're initiating adjusted EPS guidance of $5.32 to $5.46, which represents growth of 8% to 11% over our 2012 EPS of $4.94. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $12.80 billion to $13.00 billion, which is 2% to 4% above our 2012 reported revenue of $12.51 billion. On an organic basis, this represents growth of about 1% to 3%, which is down from our strong growth in 2012, primarily as a result of our expectations related to sequestration and for softer demand in our industrial markets.", "Assuming current FX rates, foreign currency will be slightly negative year-over-year in terms of revenue, and we're expecting some unfavorable margin impact resulting from the Japanese yen being weaker, which pretty much flows directly through to the bottom line. Completed acquisitions are expected to contribute about 1.5% to our revenue growth in 2013. And consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance doesn't include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin. We're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion of 30 to 50 basis points. We expect margin expansion to be driven by pull-through on organic revenue growth at marginal rates; the full year benefit of our 2012 acquisitions, including incremental synergies; and productivity and cost reduction actions that contribute about 200 basis points, including PPI and PPI lean, as well as low-cost region manufacturing; global sourcing, including low-cost region sourcing, net of direct material inflation; and about $65 million of benefit from the impact of the restructuring actions we initiated in 2011 and 2012, as well as currently planned actions for 2013. These benefits will be offset by normal inflation on our indirect cost base; the medical device excise tax, which impacts our gross margin by over $20 million; select strategic investments to continue to drive growth in emerging markets and enhance our customer experience; and about $15 million in higher stock comp expense.", "Moving below the line. We're expecting net interest expense to be up about $20 million to $25 million year-over-year, reflecting the full year interest cost of the debt issued to fund the One Lambda acquisition. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, down from 16.7% in 2012 primarily as a result of the double benefit on the R&D tax credit and tax synergies related to the acquisitions and our ongoing tax planning benefits.", "We're assuming that we will return approximately $800 million of capital to our shareholders, composed of $600 million in share buybacks and about $200 million in dividends. And full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 357 million to 362 million, down 1% to 3% from 2012. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year, as well as the economic factors we've discussed.", "So in summary, despite a challenging environment in the second half, 2012 was a strong year for us. We successfully completed and integrated a number of key strategic acquisitions and we also delivered exceptionally strong adjusted EPS growth while funding a number of strategic growth investments. And while our academic and government and industrial markets continue to face some challenges, we've responded with decisive cost actions and are positioned well to achieve our earnings growth goals in 2013. I'm excited about our growth prospects for the long term and believe that we'll continue to strike the right balance between disciplined cost management and investments to drive growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken, representing ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So on the top line, as we think about guidance for the year, I mean, how are you thinking about sort of the progression of core growth given the trends that you see in the business and then transposing that against obviously the 1Q uncertainty with the sequester debate coming up in March, and then obviously the macro data, where most of the PMIs or other indicators are kind of net improving? So how are you sort of thinking about those puts and takes as it relates to kind of the trending throughout the year?", "Marc N. Casper", "As we looked at 2012, we delivered consistent performance throughout the year, with 4% organic growth in each quarter. And while each quarter has some puts and takes, we think that 2013 will be pretty consistent as well in terms of organic growth within the guidance. So we're not looking at big changes quarter-to-quarter. What we are assuming, as I think it came out from Pete's and my comments, is really 2 factors. One, we're assuming that sequestration will happen, which is consistent with what we have been saying since January of last year. So what's baked into our guidance here is that, that happens on March 1. And second is that the industrial economy continues to be soft and the range within the guidance on the top line is depending on how soft we see the industrial markets playing out.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And maybe my second question, I want to use a little bit of imagination here. Periodically, across the space, peers go through different things and folks will maybe look at sort of a strategic process. And so occasionally, you've done more tuck-in type deals the last year, 1.5 years. But occasionally, obviously large assets within the space, peers become available. As you think about the potential of things like that, what are the 2 or 3 things that come to mind for you as you're thinking about more transformative transactions and the sort of metrics you think about when you're contemplating what to do there?", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks for the question and it's one that -- probably from just a high level, you know that we don't comment on kind of the chatter in the marketplace, right? And I know a number you sent some emails to Ken. And we certainly don't want to comment on speculation about M&A. I think what you should get a sense of from Pete's and my comment is that we had a really strong year. Our results show that we're gaining share and that our competitive position has never been stronger. So I think that's how I think about what others in the world might be thinking about. M&A criteria, you guys, everybody knows where our M&A criteria is on every transaction. And we follow that criteria, which is create value for our customers, strengthen the company strategically and then, obviously, focus on creating shareholder value as measured by ROIC as the primary metric. Hopefully, that covers that question for everybody in the queue.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg representing Macquarie Research.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I know you just said you hoped it answered the question for everyone in the queue, but I just want to ask it a little bit differently, I guess, with your stock having had a tremendous run. Last time you issued equity was with Fisher. So can you maybe just remind us when you'd be willing to issue equity for a deal, kind of if you look at that differently, and then maybe some of the more recent deals, where you've been able to do them all debt? Can you maybe just talk a little bit around your comments of when you might be willing to issue equity versus just some of the debt deals that you've done?", "Marc N. Casper", "Jon, I think again on sort of speculation, it's not one that we're going to spend time on here or subsequently. I think, as you know, every transaction in any context gets evaluated individually, and it's based on some merits. And that's how we would think about anything of that sort. And for those of you that listened to or were at the JPMorgan Conference back in January or read the transcript, one of the things I talked about very early in that presentation I gave was that we're very optimistic about our prospects. And we showed our valuation relative to the S&P Healthcare Index, the S&P 500 Index. And we feel that we think we have very bright prospects relative to the very broad alternatives of investments out there.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but you gave your investment criteria. So is it fair to say you don't necessarily have an aversion to using equity if everything met the criteria that you just talked about previously?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think right now I'm focused on how we did last year and where we're focused on for 2013.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Fair enough. And then my question is, biopharma has been really strong for you. Can you maybe talk about the outlook, because maybe you have tougher comps, some of the bio production business can be a bit lumpier? Can you maybe just talk about your expectation for that business in 2013?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. From our view, we had strong momentum all year in pharma and biotech, high single-digit growth. And from my prepared remarks, we're gaining traction with that customer set because of our value proposition. And we're doing that because we're helping those customers improve their productivity, as well as accelerate their innovation. And that's why we're doing so well. We remain clearly optimistic based on our track record that 2013 will be another good year. Personally, I had the opportunity to meet with many of the CEOs of the largest biotech and pharma companies in the month of January. I had a significant number of interactions, and they appreciate the momentum that we have with them and the impact that we're having. So, we think that will continue to have strong growth as we get into 2013, probably not as quite as strong always, every single quarter, but we're expecting strong growth.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Daniel Brennan, representing Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "So just on maybe first on Phadia and Dionex. Marc and Pete, can you just discuss -- and you certainly faced some headwinds in 2012 on both businesses, given Europe and the flu. So, I'm just wondering like -- can you remind us? I know you broke out contribution overall, and then you kind of backed out kind of where Phadia and Dionex were. But explicitly, how did this business do in '12? And how should we think about 2013, given some of the easy compares they must have?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when I look at Phadia and Dionex, both of those integrations are essentially complete. They've gone smoothly. When I look at the businesses, both of them from a ROIC perspective are tracking to what we thought they would do. We are benefiting from stronger synergies. In the case of those businesses, significantly favorable tax synergies as well, and obviously a little bit softer top line performance with Phadia because of weakness in Southern Europe from a diagnostic perspective, as well as the very weak Japan pollen season. The good news within Phadia is the U.S. business performed very well, so that core growth thesis that we've had there continues to be very much intact.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then maybe second, just focusing on one of your kind of the key businesses, mass spec, which, Marc, you pointed out, the Q Exactive and the strength that you had there in 2012. Just how should we be thinking about momentum that you have in that business going forward in kind of '13? Is it just really the Q Exactive continuing with more opportunity, I mean, particularly against some of your competitors that are in the midst of some pretty impressive product launches? So I'm just wondering, are you going to ride the heels of Q Exactive for another year or there's some new initiatives that we should be thinking about to help sustain growth in that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So, Dan, when I look at our mass spec business, we had really a very strong year, and we are very bullish on our prospects for 2013, as well. Q Exactive has incredible momentum so that will continue to propel us. But in addition to that, we have a very exciting set of products in the pipeline for launches during the course of this year. So I think when you look at the full year outlook for mass spec, it'll be more than just a Q Exactive story, but the Q Exactive will give us substantial growth during the course of the year. That's our expectation.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson, representing JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One for Pete. You've done a great job on the tax rate, kind of bringing that down. Can you just talk about theoretically how you're thinking about that going forward, and to the extent you're doing bolt-ons, large or small, how protected your current tax structure would be?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. So as I said, we did 16.7% in 2012. We're guiding to 14.5% to 15% in 2013. A lot of that does come from structures that we're able to put in place and planning that we're able to do as a result of acquisitions. So, certainly Dionex, Phadia and One Lambda have helped that out. It's tough to say going forward on a given acquisition whether or not we'll have those opportunities. But I certainly feel good about staying in this kind of range for the near term.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And I know you had a question before on kind of the sequential trends throughout the quarter. We did hear from one of your peers about kind of demand pull-forward. Any comments there, maybe as it relates to some of the more industrial-type customers?", "Peter M. Wilver", "It wasn't insignificant, no different than any other Q4.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, Marc, you've talked a lot about kind of incremental R&D investments. As we think about '13, any areas that you can call out in terms of priorities, whether it's within Specialty Diagnostics or Analytical Technologies? You obviously talked about some new product cycles, we should think about this year?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, actually, in Specialty Diagnostics -- first of all, high-level R&D this year is basically going to grow in line with our top line. So as a percent of sales, it'll be pretty consistent. When I think about where we're putting additional focus from an R&D perspective, companion diagnostics is a big effort for us. There's a significant opportunity in taking what are historically life science tools and apply them in diagnostic applications. So, that's important. And then we have a great set of lineup for products for the ASMS and other conferences in mass spec. So that's just some of the focus areas for R&D this year.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla, representing Citi.", "Unknown Analyst", "This is Nick Nolan [ph] in for Amit today. First off, on guidance, what is your end market assumptions and your geographic assumptions underneath that? And, two, could you flesh out China a little bit? Just because some of the competition we've seen is just a bifurcation in that market with the health care environment and in the industrial space.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So I'll handle the first part. In terms of our 4 end markets: pharma and biotech assumes mid- to high-single-digit growth; academic and government, down low single digits; industrial and applied, around flat; and then health care and diagnostics, low to mid single digits. So those are the ranges for the market segments. And then from a geographic standpoint: North America, flat to down low single digits; Europe, low single digits; Asia Pac, mid to high single digits; and rest of the world, mid to high single digits.", "Marc N. Casper", "From a China perspective, it's 2 years in a row of 20% organic growth. It's been very consistent every quarter in that range. I just returned from China in November and there's a lot of really positive macro factors helping our business. And they look to be quite sustainable. Big emphasis on food safety, huge expansion of the health care system, intense focus on air quality. These are things that benefit Thermo Fisher substantially, which is why we feel good about our outlook in China.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro, representing Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First one would be just on some of your recent acquisitions? I don't think you guys mentioned in your prepared comments, but what you guys saw in terms of performance from Princeton, One Lambda, Doe & Ingalls this quarter, and then maybe what expectations for those businesses you have baked in for 2013?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So really One Lambda is the only one of any real substantial nature, and  that's relatively small. So One Lambda's off to a great start. We closed that in mid-September. That business is growing very well. The integration has gone incredibly smoothly. We feel good about our prospects for 2013 with that business, so we feel good. And the other acquisitions generally are performing along our expeditions.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then maybe a more thematic question. You guys in the past have talked a little bit about the potential to benefit as your biopharma customers streamline their supply chains, work with fewer vendors. Can you maybe comment on the opportunities you see to benefit from that theme and other verticals that you guys serve?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. It's one that clearly is resonating. Obviously, biopharma is the biggest customer set that it's relevant to. But chemical, petrochem, contract testing labs clearly benefiting or benefit from this value proposition. Med device companies really has been a substantial focus, and that's gone well. Really any company that has gone through a shift in environment, where productivity is more important and they have a reasonably high level of laboratory spend, that what we do is very relevant and the value proposition resonates.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "And I guess I should have been more specific. Given we're in theoretically a period of sustained austerity in a lot of budgets, even in a better economic environment, do you think there's any potential for acceleration of that theme in the nonhealth care markets you serve this year and next?", "Marc N. Casper", "I do. I mean, I think like everything, I think as you get more experienced with different verticals, you learn from them and you get better at doing it. So I think the answer is yes, I think the choppier end markets allow for us to have a very differentiated dialogue versus the competition, because we drive huge productivity for our customers. And that actually is helping us gain share across a number of verticals.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias, representing UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Marc, you talked about the ability to put through new cost actions through right away if things worsen. So I guess, how would you view sequestration in those terms? Is that the type of worsening that you think has you doing something right away? Or do you sort of wait to see what the customer reaction is post any decision?", "Marc N. Casper", "So we're already taking cost actions because of sequestration. So that is already embedded in our operating plan and our guidance. So that's happening. It's more of if things get even more muted on the industrial side would we take the incremental contingency plan. So that's our base assumption on sequestration.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Great. And then, I guess, just following up a bit more specifically on Phadia, just wondering if you could touch on the expansion of the autoimmune portion of that business. Obviously, a great position in Europe, so I'm just guessing that things are positive in the U.S. But I'm wondering if you could comment about extending that #1 position in the U.S.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. Autoimmune is a really good category for us because historically as opposed to many categories in diagnostics, where you have large instruments with a large menu, autoimmune is a lot of one-offs, independent platforms, manual methods, lab-developed tests. And we have an automated platform with a very extensive menu. So we have nice momentum. It's still small, it's still young in terms of our focus on it, but we think autoimmune is going to be a really nice growth driver as we expand beyond the traditional base in Europe, and the U.S. is off to a good start.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Jon Wood, representing Jefferies.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "So, Marc, thanks for comments on just the industrial outlook. I'd like to kind of pick apart the applied markets versus some of the later-cycle materials, process industrial markets. How do you see those pacing? Have you seen that, that later-cycle piece start to bottom out? Or are we still kind of grinding lower? How does that industrial piece kind of pace throughout 2013, in your view?", "Marc N. Casper", "So from when you pick apart industrial and applied, it covers a lot of different things. The applied markets are generally showing more pockets of strength than the industrial. When you break into the industrial, I'd say the longest lead time, the latest cycle parts of the portfolio have obviously still good revenue momentum. Bookings softened as we got later into 2012 as customers became more uncertain about the economic environment. So that's the comments, when Pete or I are saying that some customers are holding off on purchase decisions, the capital projects exist, it's just pulling the trigger. So that's why we're assuming that industrial markets are going to be soft during the course of '13. And there are obviously potential upsides to that, but that's our base assumption going into our guidance.", "Jon Davis Wood - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. Appreciate it. Follow-up is it's been a while -- obviously, a great year in pharma. It's been a while since you talked about the top 20. Can you give us some color around how you're doing in that big-customer group and what the forward look appears like today?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. If you look at -- we don't talk that much about it because we're covering so many more customers with the valuable proposition in the top 20. But if we grew -- and we grew high single-digits with biotech and pharma last year, our top 20 actually grew a little faster than that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel, representing Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "First, I think this is really for Pete. On the Lab Products and Services side, margins were flat in 2012 versus 2011. You had some really nice large account wins in 2012, which I would think would benefit margins increasingly as you move further into those agreements. You've directed some spend towards improving that business operationally, and it also seems like you're making some nice progress in converting customers from third-party to self-produced products in the catalog. Would it be fair to conclude, given all these dynamics, that you should have some margin momentum in LPS heading into 2013?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. As I said in my comments, in the second half we actually expanded margins by 35 basis points. So I would expect for the full year in 2013, if the top line plays out the way we have in our guidance, that you would see some margin expansion there, not to the tune of the second half performance but certainly some good margin expansion.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And I'm going to risk incurring your wrath by asking one more M&A criteria question. I just wanted to -- so in the past, you've articulated that you don't want to go meaningfully above 3x debt-to-EBITDA. In certain instances, you'd stretch to 3.5. How stringent should we think about that part of the criteria?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's something from a high level that we've talked about for a long time, so I think that's a good reflection of how we think about our balance sheet.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby, representing Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Question on margins. If you could just talk about how you guys are thinking about getting to that 30 to 50 basis points of margin improvement. Marc, you said how you expect R&D to kind of grow in line with sales, and then you've got the medical device tax coming in. So I'm just kind of thinking about how much leverage you can get on the SG&A line there.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. So in terms of margin expansion going into 2013, I guided to 30 to 50 basis points. About, say, 30 basis points of that is coming from gross margin, and that's primarily driven by all the productivity actions that we have. But we also do see the impact of the medical device tax in gross margins. So it's almost 20 basis points of dilution. So good productivity offset by the medical device tax. And then SG&A, probably around 10 or so basis points, maybe 15 basis points of expansion just by volume leverage and a little bit impacted by higher stock comp, and then R&D, as you said, about growing with revenue.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. And then just my second thing was on the restructuring savings. If I heard you correctly, and maybe I missed it, did that come in a little bit higher in 2012 than what you initially had laid out? I thought you were initially expecting maybe a $50 million worth of benefit. Is that correct? And then the $65 million or $60 million for 2013, is that still a good number of what you expect to benefit from these restructurings?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. In 2012, we started the year guiding to about $50 million. I pretty much updated that number last quarter. So we came in at $65 million, and that's a result of some of the actions that we'd put in place during the year. So we'll get the benefit of those more in 2013 than we did in 2012. So when you add up the benefit of the 2011, 2012 actions, as well as some of the other things that we currently have planned, you get to about $65 million of benefit in 2013 from all of the restructuring actions.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott, representing Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I understand the conservatism around sequestrations. But I'm wondering if you can break out, I guess, what's baked into revenue and EPS guidance for the sequestration cut. And can you just confirm that you're assuming an 8% cut on the sequester?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when -- I had the benefit of talking to Dr. Collins yesterday, who's the head of the NIH, and spent a fair amount of time with a key Republican congressman last week to talk through this issue. I think 2 things, one is we continue to believe that sequestration will happen. I think the conventional wisdom is that it's going to be a little over a 5% cut over the -- on a full year budget. So that's what the conventional wisdom is on the cut is going to be. So it's compressed, obviously, in a period from March and through the end of September. Less clear is what's going to happen in the fourth quarter, because it's a new fiscal year for the government. But a little over 5% seems to be the conventional wisdom on the cut. That's what's assumed baked into our numbers.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "Okay. And sorry if I missed this, but could you give your ROIC targets for 2013?", "Marc N. Casper", "We gave long-term. We have the 2016 goal and in terms of what we're targeting and with the goal of increasing it steadily over time. So back in the EMEA, [indiscernible] has a good view on that.", "Operator", "And your question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin, representing Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I'm looking at -- what is the -- you said you're expecting the academic and government business to be down roughly mid single digits, and that's about 25% of your business. So that's roughly 1 to 1.5 percentage points of growth there that would under a more normal circumstance would be in your organic guidance. And then so what do you think the industrial softness is costing you as well? I'm just trying to figure out what is sort of the normalized growth rate for the guidance would be if we were in a more -- less crazy market.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Derik, it's Pete. So on the academic and government, it is actually down low single digits, not mid single digits. But the industrial and applied probably cost us about 1 percentage point year-over-year in terms of the growth rate.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So one of the real standouts in 2012 was the Lab Products and Services business. I mean, it put up a 4% organic number, and it hasn't done that in a while. And obviously that's sort of with some of the headwinds going on in the markets there. Is sort of this growth rate for LPS in the 3% to 5% range, do you think that's sustainable going forward for the next several years?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. When you -- and actually, this was a number of times, and I think 2012 is a great reflection of it, right? We feel very confident about our ability to be a mid-single-digit organic growth company. We obviously were in 2012. We laid out our assumptions, Derik, about how we're thinking about the economic end markets being very difficult in 2013. So we're saying at the midpoint, we're a 2% grower. And when you bridge that, as Pete said, mostly most industrial as well as sequestration gets you from the 4% to the 2%. Once you get out of that period of time, we feel like mid-single-digit growth is where we're going to grow as a company and we think that Lab Products and Services is very consistent with that in terms of organic growth outlook. Remember, in that business, you've got an incredible Biopharma Services business, which is clinical trials, outsourcing. We've got the leading channel that has great momentum in the marketplace. So we feel good about our prospects for growth across our portfolio.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And I guess, certainly, a lot of investors are very happy to see you guys increase the dividend -- and stay with the dividend and increase it this year. Could you sort of talk about how you're thinking about the dividend going forward and how should we think about modeling it from an increase standpoint? Is this something you're going to do on an annual basis?", "Marc N. Casper", "This is something that we review with the Board periodically. It's obviously -- we're very new in this. We initiated it beginning of last year, and we raised it in November and the Board will review it on a periodic basis. We're assuming in our guidance that we're going to return $200 million roughly of capital via the dividend, which is assuming a $0.15 per quarter. That's what the basic assumption is at this point. But our Board will review that over time.", "So let me just wrap it up. So thank you, everyone. We had a very successful year in 2012. We feel we're well positioned to carry our momentum into 2013 by focusing our customers to drive growth, using our productivity to strengthen the bottom line, and then obviously deploying capital to create shareholder value. We're looking forward to updating you on our Q1 call. And, of course, thank you for your continued support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Everyone, have a nice day.", "Operator", "Thank you for your participation in today's conference. And this concludes the presentation.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's conference, Ms. Carol Cox, Head of Investor Relation. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Carol A. Cox", "Great, thank you, Kay. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Life Technologies Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. We issued our press release today earlier at 1 p.m. Pacific time and posted it on our website at lifetechnologies.com, which is also filed on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, we have posted a deck of slides to accompany today's webcast, which may be found in the events and presentations section of the company's investor relations website with our other earnings materials.", "Joining me on today's call are Greg Lucier, our Chairman and CEO; David Hoffmeister, our Chief Financial Officer; Mark Stevenson, our Chief Operating Officer; and Ronnie Andrews, our Head of Medical Sciences. They will also be available for Q&A portion of the call. If you have not had a chance to review the earnings release, it can be found on our website, at lifetechnologies.com.", "Before we get started, I'd just like to remind everyone that our discussion today will include forward-looking statements, including, but not limited to statements about future expectations, plans and prospects for the company, corporate strategy and performance. We believe these statements are based on reasonable assumptions, but actual results may differ materially from those indicated.", "Important factors, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, are detailed in the filings made by the company with the SEC.

Lucier", "Thanks, Carol, and thank you to everyone who is joining us today as we provide an overview of our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and expectations for 2013.", "We started 2012 with a promise to our shareholders to grow our underlying business, invest in growth markets and regions, deliver on balanced capital deployment strategy and introduce innovative new products to serve our customers even better.", "Our performance during the year had its challenges, including the weakened macroeconomic environment that affected Life Sciences' industry globally, and uncertainty in NIH funding in the U.S., in particular. But our management team and employees remain focused and were able to deliver against the promises we made.", "We introduced game-changing products across all our business groups, expanded further into emerging markets, built the foundation for our Molecular Diagnostics business, and increased our global manufacturing footprint in China, Singapore and Europe, allowing us to be ever more cost competitive.", "Now let me turn to the results. For the full year, we delivered revenue and earnings per share growth for the 13th year in a row. Revenue increased 2.2% to $3.8 billion, and our operating margin expanded to 29.2%. Non-GAAP earnings per share increased 7% to $3.98, and our strong free cash flow totaled $662 million, enabling us to invest in growing our business and return $635 million to shareholders through share repurchases.", "We finished the year strong with fourth quarter revenue growth at 4.5%, excluding currency. This growth was driven principally by Ion Torrent and our Research Consumables and Bioproduction businesses. Non-GAAP EPS of $1.11 came within the guidance we'd provided and included absorbing a negative $0.03 impact related to the benefit of the 2012 federal R&D tax credit being pushed from Q4 into the first quarter of 2013.", "Additionally, we delivered results even though a large order on our Applied Science business moved out of Q4 into 2013. We have been very focused on driving our Consumables business even higher. Our mix of consumables and services is now 85% of our total revenue.", "In addition, 2012 is the first year where over half our revenue has been generated outside of the Americas, making us an increasingly global company.", "Finally, we have focused over the last 18 months on reducing our exposure to academia and government, which we have been able to reduce by 10%. While this is still an important customer base for us, given the leading edge science taking place in those end markets, we invest more heavily in expanding our footprint in the faster growing hospital and clinical end markets.", "We continued to gain momentum as we expand in the higher growth markets through a combination of strategic acquisitions, partnerships and internal development.", "During the quarter and into 2013, we made acquisitions in our Research Consumables and Applied Sciences businesses, where we are able to immediately leverage our broad distribution capability.", "In November, we acquired AMG, the developer of imaging systems for research microscopy and the manufacturer of our FLoid Cell Imaging Station. AMG has grown rapidly by successfully developing a complete portfolio of cell imaging products across a range of functionality and price points, which allows us to compete more effectively with established players in a financially constrained environment.", "With AMG, we are able to expand our product line of cell imaging instrumentation, while leveraging our own molecular Probes, dyes and reagents for a total workflow system.", "In January, we acquired BAC, a leader in protein purification products with a unique set of innovative and proprietary affinity ligands, which are molecules capable of binding with specific proteins and are typically attached to chromatography resins in a production scale bio purification process. Protein purification is a growing market and a logical adjacency to our existing bioprocess business. With this bolt-on acquisition, our Bioproduction business is now squarely positioned as the provider of end-to-end solutions that are widely utilized in the bioprocess workflow and can compete more fully across the protein purification markets.", "In January, we also announced we had entered into an exciting new partnership with Boston Children's Hospital to form Claritas Genomics. This new company, in which Life will be a part owner, will develop next generation genetic and genomics-based diagnostic testing solutions for pediatric and inherited diseases, by standardizing their work on the Ion Torrent technology, including proton, PGM and the related consumables.", "Life is providing capital and technical support to ensure our sequencers are optimized for the workflow that will be developed at Claritas Genomics. We're very excited to have established what we believe is an innovative and flexible structure we can duplicate, going forward, as we partner with select institutions to accelerate the adoption of genetic testing and pediatrics, and ultimately, in advancing Ion Torrent technology into Molecular Diagnostics.", "And during the quarter, we continued to execute on our development pipeline with 2 production introductions in our leading qPCR business. At ASHG, we announced the QuantStudio 3D digital PCR system, a scalable, chip-based instrument that features a simple workflow with minimal hands-on time. This bench top platform is disruptively priced at $30,000, enabling access to a broad community and will compete in a global market that is expected to grow to $250 million by 2016.", "We also announced the launch of our QuantStudio Dx real time PCR instrument, which is CE IVD marked for use in Europe, and represents a significant extension of Life's product offerings in the diagnostics arena. Molecular testing is the fastest-growing segment of the diagnostics market, and QuantStudio has unique features to meet the needs of this market, including passage and detection, gene detection, gene expression analysis, SNP genotyping, microRNA and high-resolution melt analysis.", "Through a partnership with Quidel and others, we will have a menu of infectious disease and oncology tests, CE IVD marked for the European and Asian markets, being launched throughout 2013, bringing a high value menu to market unregulated platforms such as QuantStudio Dx, allows us to further penetrate the clinical markets outside the U.S. and begin the democratization of our platforms.", "Early in 2012, we laid out a strategy to build out our Molecular Diagnostics offerings and assets with a vision to become the most relevant provider of high-value information to assist physicians in the management of complex diseases.", "Our first investments were building one of the strongest management teams in the industry, with expertise in this area to bolster our commercial and regulatory efforts. Second, we built the foundation for this business with the acquisitions of 3 companies: Navigenics, Pinpoint Genomics and Compendia, through which we now possess arguably the most robust bioinformatics and physician portal capabilities in the industry, which will enable commercialization of high-value cancer diagnostics.", "In a very short amount of time, we've been able to assemble capabilities in software and bioinformatics and launch our first lab-developed test, the Pervenio Lung Cancer test service.", "Additionally, we now have a CLIA lab in one of our largest annotated databases of cancer patient samples globally. In 2013, and over the next several years, we intend to focus our efforts on strengthening our position in oncology and transplant diagnostics by developing a rich menu of compelling assays and panels on multiple platforms. As well, we plan to continue to create strong partnerships with leaders in these disease areas and work to build out our molecular diagnostic capabilities, largely through self funding initiatives. We believe we are well-positioned to deliver a continuum of systems to improve community access to information that will improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall cost of care.", "New introductions continued and continue the momentum of our installed base that allowed us to more than double the revenue of our Ion Torrent franchise for the second consecutive year. The fast-growing desktop market is highly competitive, and we estimate that our market share is now about 60%.", "We see this as the largest growth segment in the clinical research area of Molecular Diagnostics and look for Proton to grow that market share even further now.", "During the fourth quarter, we continue to launch new products that enhance our next generation sequencing offerings. We launched the new 400-base pair sequencing kit for the Ion PGM Sequencer, which produces reads 60% longer than comparable high-throughput benchtop sequencers, generating more complete bacterial de novo assemblies with longer contiguous sequences.", "We also made progress in expanding our best-in-class Ion AmpliSeq Panels. These panels allow our customers to do fast and affordable targeted sequencing for genes or genomic regions, and provide the highest level multiplexing with 3,000 targets per reaction, while requiring very small amounts of DNA, much less than other competitors, which is critical in research, especially related to cancer.", "We've already seen thousands of customer designs in the first 9 months of our custom AmpliSeq Panels. And with our new AmpliSeq Community Panels, we are rapidly growing panel menu across cancer and inherited disease, which is increasingly being utilized for clinical research.", "Last quarter, we launched our Ion Proton System instrument, a platform whose speed, ease-of-use and affordability will democratize genome sequencing by opening up the market to affordable clinical exomes and genomes.", "We are extremely pleased with the high level of customer interest. One full quarter into the launch, I'm pleased to say that we had our strongest quarter ever for Ion Torrent franchise, as continued strong demand to the PGM and a substantial sequential increase in the proton systems fueled our growth.", "We are seeing the real uptick of this technology as customers see how we have increased throughput, read-length and accuracy on the PGM and are confident we will be able to deliver it again on Proton. Proton with the P1 chip is the only bench top sequencer enabling human exome and transcriptome analysis today.", "With the PII chip, Proton will enable whole genome analysis. During the quarter, our businesses continue to generate strong free cash flow of $173 million. At the beginning of the year, we communicated our commitment to return 50% of our available free cash flow to shareholders. We ended the year having purchased $635 million, or 14 million shares in total for the year, well above that 50% level. We have continued to repurchase shares and have completed another $105 million to date in 2013 already.", "We have an additional $470 million remaining under a $750 million share repurchase program. As we move into 2013, we're focused on 3 priorities we believe will help us drive our performance and increase shareholder value. These include: Transforming our relationships with Life Science customers, meaning we're committed to providing our lab customers with the broadest array of tools and solutions, including web channels and sophisticated supply centers, so they can get their work done faster, more easy and less expensively.", "We think this will expand our market share. Second, we're focused on winning in Genetic Analysis from discovery to diagnostics, where we have platforms and expertise to move further towards clinical use; and finally, we continue to pursue growth in our applied markets, where we can apply our expertise and innovation to new opportunities to expand a current business or enter a new vertical in a very disciplined way.", "Moving on to guidance. We're expecting revenue growth of 3% to 5% over 2012 results of $3.8 billion, driven by another significant increase in our Ion Torrent franchise sales for the third consecutive year and expansion in our applied and emerging markets.", "Additionally, we expect to gain momentum from the roll off of a portion of the headwinds we had in 2012. The low end of the range, 3% growth, already assumes sequestration could reduce our revenue by approximately 1%, if implemented.", "While the fiscal cliff reduces the sequesters threatened NIH cut from 8.2% to 5.1%, there is now meaningful risk sequester will occur, at least temporarily. We therefore believe it's prudent to take a conservative approach here and revise as events unfold.", "For non-GAAP EPS, we're expecting results in the range of $4.30 to $4.45, applying 8% to 12% growth over 2012 results. We continue to do our best to navigate through these uncertain times, and remain committed to driving innovation and further diversifying our end market exposure.", "We are continuing to make investments in markets where we believe we have growth opportunities, such as next generation sequencing and Molecular Diagnostics that will make us increasingly more competitive and diversified.", "As we look ahead to 2013 and into 2014, we think many of these challenges to growing our top line have improved, and that through disciplined capital deployment we can grow our bottom line, while still making the necessary investments to be even more competitive over the next 3 to 5 years.", "Before I turn the call over to David, I would like to briefly address our annual strategic review. As you know, we recently issued a press release announcing that our Board of Directors had engaged outside financial advisors to assist them. While we normally would not have announced this, we believed it was prudent in light of speculation in the media. The Board's annual review started last summer, when our stock was trading in the low 40s. The Board engaged financial advisors to help in valuation work and reviewing opportunity to create value for our shareholders.", "As any thorough review would entail, all ideas are on the table, including pursuing our current strategy, which has yielded solid results, or something different.", "The Board has not decided on any specific course of action, but any decision will be based on what the Board believes is in the best interest of shareowners to further create value.", "I recognize that many of you have many questions on this topic. At this time, I am unable to comment further or provide any additional information. The Board's review is ongoing, and we will update you as appropriate. In the meanwhile, the more than 10,000 Lifetech employees around the world remain totally focused on our customers and making 2013 another great year. With that, I'll turn the call over to David.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Thanks, Greg. Good afternoon, everyone. In my remarks today, I'll provide an overview of our results for the fourth quarter and a more detailed commentary around our expectations for 2013.", "As Greg noted, we finished -- we had a solid finish to 2012, growing our full year revenue over 2% and our non-GAAP EPS, 7%.", "For the fourth quarter, revenue, excluding the impact of currency, increased 4.5%, to $999 million.", "Our non-GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.11, driven by mid-single-digit revenue growth and the benefit of a lower share count as we continue to repurchase shares, somewhat offset by a higher tax rate. As a reminder, our guidance had assumed that the R&D tax credit would be renewed in Q4. As you know, it wasn't.", "If we had realized this tax benefit in the quarter, our Q4 earnings per share would have been $1.14. Our free cash flow for the quarter totaled $173 million. Revenue, excluding currency by region, was as follows: The Americas grew 3/10 of 1%; Europe grew 5%; Asia Pacific grew 18%; and Japan grew 6%. All regions benefited from a strong demand for Ion Torrent products.", "In addition, we continued to see stable academic end markets in the Americas. Europe was also relatively stable, with additional growth due to timing of orders in our pharma and biotech end markets.", "We saw a growth in Japan, primarily due to Ion Torrent products. And Asia Pacific showed continued strength due to growth in Greater China.", "Taking a closer look at our business group results for the quarter. Research Consumables revenue increased 2% to $409 million. Excluding currency, revenue increased 4% over the same period last year. Full year revenue increased 1% to $1.6 billion or 2%, excluding the impact of currency.", "Revenue growth in the quarter and full year were driven by growth in our cell culture products, sample prep products and bench top instruments.", "Revenue for Genetic Analysis increased 2% to $401 million for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Excluding currency, revenue increased by 4%.", "Full year revenue, including currency, was flat at approximately $1.5 billion. Excluding the impact from currency, revenue grew 1%.", "Revenue growth for the quarter and the full year was primarily due to substantial growth in our Ion Torrent business, with continued strong demand for the PGM and the Ion Proton systems.", "Offsetting some of this revenue growth was the expected headwind from the decline in SOLiD instrument sales and qPCR royalty payments. While we had expected an approximate $10 million decline in qPCR royalties in the fourth quarter, we were able to partially offset those declines with additional royalty licensing programs.", "For the full year, our qPCR royalty decline was about $20 million, $10 million less than the $30 million we had anticipated at the beginning of the year.", "Applied Sciences revenue increased 8% to $190 million for the fourth quarter compared to the prior year. Excluding currency, Applied Sciences grew 10%.", "The increase in the quarter was driven primarily by increased sales in Bioproduction. For the full year, Applied Sciences revenue grew 7% to $719 million or up 8%, excluding currency, primarily due to growth in Forensics and Bioproduction.", "Our fourth quarter gross margin increased 20 basis points to 64.6% compared to prior year, driven by manufacturing fixed cost leverage, partially offset by a higher mix of instrument sales and the impact of unfavorable currency.", "Full year gross margin was 65.6%, an increase of 40 basis points, primarily due to improved product mix and higher realized price, offset by the decrease in qPCR royalties and unfavorable currency. On a sequential basis, the fourth quarter gross margin declined 100 basis points, primarily due to higher Ion Torrent instrument sales.", "Operating expenses of $347 million were $19 million higher on a year-over-year basis, principally due to the impact of recent tuck-in acquisitions in our Molecular Diagnostics business and in Greater China.", "On a sequential basis, operating expenses were up slightly as expected, due to currency and the molecular diagnostics acquisitions. Our operating profit for the quarter totaled $299 million, an increase of 1% over prior year.", "Fourth quarter operating margin was 29.9%, representing a decrease of 70 basis points. The decrease from the prior year was primarily due to the higher operating expenses I just described and unfavorable currency rates.", "On a full year basis, we expanded operating margins by 20 basis points to 29.2%, slightly below our guidance range of 25 to 50 basis points. Our margin expansion was driven primarily by an increase in gross margins and improvement in currency, partially offset by higher expenses related to acquisitions.", "In other income line items for the quarter, we had $700,000 of interest income, a loss of $800,000 from foreign exchange and other items, and interest expense of $30 million. Our tax rate for the quarter was 27.2%, higher than the prior year fourth quarter rate of 26.7%, mainly due to the R&D tax credit.", "As a result, the full year tax rate was 27.6%, higher than the prior year rate of 27.3%. Our diluted share count for the quarter was 175.8 million, a decrease of 8.8 million compared to the prior year as we continue to repurchase shares as part of our overall capital deployment strategy.", "In Q4, we repurchased approximately 2 million shares for $100 million. As Greg mentioned, we have also repurchased another 105 million shares since the beginning of 2013.", "Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Our ending cash and short-term investments were $276 million. This compares to last quarter's balance of $299 million. Cash from operating activities for the quarter was $221 million. Capital expenditures were $48 million and free cash flow was $173 million. Free cash flow for the full year totaled $662 million.", "Return on invested capital was approximately 9% for the quarter. Our ending debt as of December 31 was $2.4 billion. This balance is made up of our senior notes of $2.3 billion, plus some short-term debt.", "We ended the year within our target leverage range of 2.0 to 2.5x EBITDA. Now let me take a moment and talk about our outlook for 2013.", "As Greg said, we are expecting revenue growth, excluding currency, to be in a range of 3% to 5% for the year, driven by a continued ramp in Ion Torrent sales and growth in Applied Sciences, as well as the roll-off of the majority of the headwinds we had in 2012.", "Our range does include assumptions related to sequestration. Recall that we have previously indicated that full implementation of sequestration could be a 1% headwind to revenue growth, based on our exposure to the NIH and other U.S. government funding.", "Therefore, should sequestration be implemented, and in place for the balance of the year, we would expect our revenue growth to be at the low end of the guidance range or 3%. Currency at December month end rates is expected to have a small negative impact to our 2013 revenue of about $2 million and about $0.01 negative impact on the bottom line.", "We expect our operating margins to expand in a range of 25 to 75 basis points and to be at 31% as we exit 2013, driven by continued improvements in operational efficiencies and Ion Torrent moving to profitability. Offsetting some of this expansion is continued investment in emerging markets and molecular diagnostics.", "Given our additional share repurchases in Q4 and at the beginning of 2013, we are now expecting our full year share count to be about 175 million. We expect our tax rate to be 27.6% for the full year. This rate includes the federal R&D tax credit benefit of approximately $0.03 for 2012 that will be realized in the first quarter of this year.", "Taking into account these factors, we expect EPS for 2013 to range from $4.30 to $4.45. We plan to update our currency expectations based on month end rates at the end of each quarter. While we cannot predict how rates will move throughout 2013, if all currencies moved against the dollar by 5%, and our mix of foreign currencies stayed the same, the impact on earnings per share would be about $0.23.", "We expect free cash flow to be in the range of $700 million to $750 million. Our free cash flow includes approximately $45 million of one-time expenses related to restructuring, which is about the same as we experienced in 2012.", "I'd now like to take a minute to provide some additional details on our expectations for the year and the first quarter that I believe will help you update your financial models.", "We expect our revenue and earnings to be weighted to the back half of the year, primarily driven by continued growth in Ion Torrent and applied markets. Revenue in the second and third quarter should be relatively in line with each other, with Q3 revenues slightly lower than Q2, due to the seasonal slowdown we normally see in the third quarter.", "Q4 should be our highest quarter for revenue and earnings. Turning to the first quarter. We expect our revenue, including currency, to be in the range of $950 million to $965 million, which assumes sequestration may be implemented on March 1. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to be in a range of $1.02 to $1.07.", "Gross margins are expected to be down year-over-year largely due to product mix, as we derive a higher portion of our revenue from Ion instrument sales.", "Operating expenses are expected to be up year-over-year, as we make the investments I mentioned earlier. Currency at December 2012 month end rates would negatively impact revenue by about $11 million and EPS by a negative $0.04 for the first quarter.", "As I said earlier, we plan to take the full $0.03 benefit from the retroactive 2012 R&D tax credit in the first quarter. And with that, I'll hand the call back over to Carol.", "Carol A. Cox", "Great. Thanks, David. We'll now open up the call to question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] Kate, if you could open it up, I'd appreciate it.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "My questions will just assume that this is a go-it alone. So my first question is, you mentioned some comments around looking at adjacent markets, but also, particularly in molecular diagnostics, focusing on internal funding. So can you maybe just talk about what your capital allocation priorities would be in 2013, given your comments about 2012? And then, just as a quick follow-up about the year as well. Can you maybe just talk about -- you had some really good growth in China and you had pretty good growth in Applied Sciences. I think you said one deal fell through into 2013. But can you maybe just talk about some of those markets that have been growing pretty quickly, kind of how confident you are that those will sustain themselves in '13?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. Let me start with the capital deployment question, and then how it relates to acquisitions. So just to reiterate, we are committed to the 50-50 balanced capital deployment strategy. And so if you were to forecast our free cash flow this year of, let's just round the number to $700 million. Half of that will go into buybacks. Half of that will go back into funding growth. In the area of funding growth, with respect to things beyond capital expenditures, which, as you know, is a very reasonable, stable amount of money for a company like ours, we would target areas that we think will give us faster growth. Our acquisition of that ligand company that goes into our bioprocess business is a great example of the perfect acquisition for us. It's reasonable in size, it's a tuck-in acquisition, and it allows us to be exposed to other elements of what is a nicely growing business of bio production. Ronnie Andrews and his leadership of Medical Sciences continues to scout for other technologies, other pieces of real estate that we need to be the vendor of choice in these more complex diseases like cancer. Although I would just say that we have clearly made a decision that, given how we see the future of diagnostics, which is different than what people would normally think about diagnostics as practiced in the past, there's not a lot of available real estate out there right now that interests us. Therefore, we grow organically, we invest organically. So that's our thoughts on capital deployment. In terms of the markets, we are really pleased with the bodybuilding we did in China over the last 18 months. We took some flak about 18 months ago for going direct, it hurt us in the quarter. But since then, we've been on a tear, as we've hired hundreds of people in direct sales force. We've acquired dealers and we think we now have one of the largest commercial footprints in that very important economy, and our results show it now, that it's paying off in terms of having that more subsitive [ph] broad-based scientific conversation with customers across many, many different cities, territories in China. Lastly, I'll just say is that this idea of globalization is critical for us. We realize that no matter what happens in the United States, it'll probably be a slower growing market for the years to come. And therefore, you're seeing us expand our direct presence, as I said, not only in China, but the Middle East, Russia, Africa, we see ourselves in ever more countries, having ever more scientists than any other company in this space. And we think that's going to allow us to have faster growth that can be had in this marketplace.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "One of the things you've commented on is the plans to get Ion Torrent to profitability embedded in your 31% operating margin targets that you played out. Can you just talk to maybe some of the steps you're taking there, including the manufacturing move to Singapore?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. So there's a few points we would make here. One is simply that there is a fair amount of fixed cost of R&D investment, personnel investment in that business, and that as the revenue scales this year, we reached the kind of release altitude and get to the point of profitability. That's probably the most important driver. The second one is that we, ironically, have sold many more instruments than we had in our original deal model, when we brought Ion Torrent into the family. And that's good because it's building the installed base. And now what we'll follow is more consumable sales. And so we're really confident that, that's going to add to the margins for 2013. And then the last is what you say in terms of where we're locating manufacturing and how we're doing manufacturing engineering, not only on the instruments, but on the reagents, where we're bringing some in-house into Ambion and some of our enterprises like that, that allows us to have a higher gross margin in our manufacturing. So those 3 elements combine us to give real confidence that Ion Torrent's going to be a nice contributor to the bottom line compared to 2012.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-on to your comment on capital deployment earlier. With Boston Children's, you've put some of your own money to work here in kind of funding a new business venture. How often are you looking at doing initiatives like that versus straight up R&D collaborations, versus building it internally?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "The Claritas Genomics opportunity for us was unique. Boston Children's arguably is the finest pediatrics hospital in the world. They have very distinct ideas and world-class personnel of how to make genomic analysis into pediatric care mainstream. And so we wanted to partner with them to not only have them fulfill their aspirations, but also help us refine our systems, our workflows, our procedures, that we could then take that technology in many other places. What was unique about that opportunity was the business structure, as I reference in my comments, is flexible and we actually see others becoming part owners of Claritas Genomics, where we're partners with Claritas Genomics, at various pediatric centers around the world. Ronnie Andrews has other business ideas that don't involve us investing, that involves us just partnering with regional Health Care Systems, and we'll deploy that as well in 2013.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just being trued [ph] in the Research Consumables growth that you generated this year. It certainly seems like a bit of a breakout, and while you were against an easy comp from last year, I'm just wondering if you can comment on kind of what you're seeing there, and kind of how you're thinking about that business going forward into '13?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "There is no doubt that the Research Consumables market place was difficult in 2012. We did see some bright light in the fourth quarter, and you can see that by our results. We also think some of our results were internally driven by some of the great work Mark Stevenson and his team has done in repositioning the portfolio to have various price points for various different functionality of choices for customers, and also by increasing our exposure to faster growing geographies, like China, like India, like Korea. As we look to 2013, we're hopeful that it'll be a bit better marketplace than it was in 2012. But as David said, more of our growth really comes from some of the headwinds that we had in 2012 evaporating, and then continued growth in our Applied and our Genomics business.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great, great. And then maybe, kind of related to that. Just, if that's a consumable franchise, are you willing to give us any color towards your, the Applied and the Genetic business as we look towards '13? And how we should think about those businesses growing? And then any specific commentary within the Genetic Analysis business outside of Ion Torrent, your other businesses within that?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, we're not prepared to give overall guidance by segment at this particular call. But for your question, I can give a little bit of color commentary. The CE business, and Mark, I'll have you chime in here, will continue to be flattish or so. But on a fairly large franchise, we think that's pretty good, given that more and more customers in the diagnostics side see that as the gold standard for confirming next generation results. So that continued resiliency of that business we see staying in place through 2013. In the Applied side, I think we'll have another good year of our BioProduction business. It's a very well-run organization with a very good management team there. And then our Forensics business and Farm to Fork are going to have, we think, record years, particularly even in Food Safety, where we'll grow at very high double digits again this year. So we see these franchises as being areas we want to invest in for an earlier question, not only in organic development, but acquisitions. And I think that's where you'll see more of our tuck-ins take place.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So the -- and David, I'm just wondering, your share count forecast for the year is $175 million for 2013, which is basically what you had in the fourth quarter. I'm just curious as to, given that you've bought some shares in Q1, just what you're sort of assuming in terms of share count in that sense?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "I think it's going to be -- the share count's about in line with $175 million. And we haven't in the guidance. Then in our guidance assumes the performance of the business and some potential share count, share repurchases going forward.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. And for the 3% to 5% constant currency growth guidance, what does the -- what are you assuming for the contribution from the various acquisitions that you've done? What's BAC adding to AMG?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "The acquisitions in total are something less than 1% of total growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Greg, can you just talk a little bit more about the Ion business? Can you talk -- I know you said in your prepared comments, a 60% share of the bench top market. Can you talk about your share in competitive situations, and give us an update on what your thoughts are on PII timing?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "You bet. I'm going to have Mark take that one. Mark, go ahead.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, in regard to the first part, we find actually all the sales are competitive. I think in this next generation space, every customer we speak to is involved in looking competitively. So when we quote our bench top share at 60%, with evolving competitive sales we've been engaged with. In terms of the progress we making, we feel really pleased with the progress we've made on the PI chip. As we've seen with the other chips, we roll them out. We continue to iterate and get improvement on that chip. We take those learnings from those chips and apply them to the next chip. We did that with the III series. And so we're doing that currently with the PI chip. The PII chip is on plan for us. We set out a schedule previously to say, approximately every 6 months, we say to the team, \"Let's launch a new chip.\" And we continue on that track. So you would expect during the middle of this year to have the second chip come out, taking the learnings we're doing with our customers now on the PI chip.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "And just a quick follow-up on Europe. Can you just give us a little more granularity on the business segment and maybe performance, Northern versus Southern Europe, because consistently, Europe has -- shows like it's been a growth market for you, especially this quarter?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Yes, the European business continues to do well in spite of a very challenging macroeconomic environment. I think part of that is it's very well-run. We think it's one of our really solid management teams. But also, they did the hard work a few years ago to reposition their business to areas such as the Middle East, Africa and Russia, where we are experiencing faster growth. If there's a look in terms of your question on the North and South, clearly, the northern part of Europe has grown faster than the southern part of Europe. And some of that growth is being driven by these larger orders in our Applied business that continue to take place in some of the countries across the European, Middle East and Africa landscape.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Amanda Murphy with William Blair.", "Amanda Murphy - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division", "I had a question on China, if I may. So obviously, the vertical integration strategy has been very successful. So I'm just curious, how you guys are thinking about China, just in terms of 2013. Is there one specific segment that you expect to outperform? And then also, just sort of longer term, how should we be thinking about through sustainable growth rates in China?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "So I think we're targeting a double-digit growth in China. I think, on a longer-term basis -- Dave, correct me -- about a 15% growth is a reasonable expectation. And our guidance in 2013 presumes a moderate level growth like that. Even though we had a higher in 2012, our guidance always is best rooted in being conservative and prudent. We think it's a great market for Life Sciences. We never saw any slowdown. We think they are investing in their university infrastructure, their government research institutes and the rise of the commercial pharmaceutical market is helping us as well. So we'll continue to invest in our commercial infrastructure, our web channels, supply centers, all the things that have been a formula for success in this research market for us in Europe, in the United States, we're now applying with real strength into China.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So on the guidance, as it relates to the sequester, where are you assuming that impacts to business, is it more on the reagent side? Is it more in instrumentation? Is it on legacy versus some of the newer products? How are you kind of, at least contextually, sort of putting that into the forecast?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, Ross, this is David. I think we're assuming that it's going to have an impact across the product portfolio. Probably next generation sequencing is going to be less impacted by that. As we said all along, what we've seen with reduction in funding, instruments are clearly impacted because people could delay purchase of an instrument. But that starts to have an impact on consumables as well, and we've seen that. So at this point, we're assuming that it's going to be across the portfolio.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. On the capital deployment side, yes, I know we talked about the share repurchase. But just on shore, it seems like you were active in Q4 and maybe early in Q1. Is that going to be through a 10b5-1? I mean, what's the method by which you're kind of applying that to market at this point?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Well, what we've typically done is we've done open market purchases, primarily conducted through 10b5-1s. And we would assume we'd continue to do that going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Barclays.", "Alison Yang - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "This is Alison Yang, asking a question -- 2 quick questions for Tony. The first one, on the strategic review. I realize this is probably limited on the discussion we could have. But just curious if just there's a timeline for which investors should expect an outcome or disclosure? The second question's for Mr. Ronnie Andrews, can he discuss, sort of the recent acquisitions in the Medical Sciences portfolio, Compendia, Navigenics and Pinpoint, how should we think about revenue contribution in '13? Should we expect revenue contribution similarly for the pharma collaborations with Bristol? And how should we think about the timing of product launches and revenue upside?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I'll take the first one and then have Ronnie take the second. As I said in my prepared remarks, the review is ongoing, and we will update shareowners as appropriate. That's all we're going to stay at this time in regard the annual review process. Ronnie?", "Ronald A. Andrews", "Yes, so the, obviously, the strategy behind Compendia, Navigenics, was really to build a robust pipeline and capability around bioinformatics ability to transfer data into knowledge for physicians. And so we're very excited about those acquisitions last year. And the team's worked very diligently to get them to a point where we now have and are able to use these capabilities. And so your question's very intuitive. The first place we want to go with this, right now, is to pharma. There's a significant interest in pharma, to have the ability to work with a company that can be a one-stop shop and carry a test, a Compendia diagnostic from and instill those designs using Compendia all the way through to IVD approval, either in Europe, through IVD CE marking or through U.S., the FDA clearance. And so clearly, the Compendia and the ability to push that information through the Navi portal into the hands of premium positions allows for real-time decision-making, and it's something that you'll see deploy the revenues for next year, for the -- sorry, for 2013, are really small this year. But as we start to gain and garner some of this new content and begin to democratize these platforms into the community, as we get Dx approval of the QuantStudio in the United States, and see some of that menu-ed at the market, that all start to happen and unfold set [ph] our third and fourth quarter this year. And you'll start to see some of these revenues start to pick up as we enter 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Ferreiro with Oppenheimer.", "David Ferreiro - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division", "I appreciate the commentary that you've made, that you're becoming less levered to academic spending. But could you give a greater explanation as to why you think a 1% headwind to revenue would be conservative enough under sequestration, given the high level of fixed costs in NIH grants now?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "Sure. Let me do -- we'll do to a twofer here. I'll start off, and then Dave can take the back end. But -- we, in our guidance on the low-end, presumed sequestration would be in effect starting March 1 and go through the balance of the calendar year. So a very conservative estimate. For the last 12 months, we've been communicating to shareowners just what the magnitude of sequestration would be when it was to be impacted, I should say, implemented January 1, which was about an 8% cut. At that time, our calculations were based off how much of our business comes from the NIH, translated through then to what its impact would be on our growth rates, if you cut it by 8% or so. And the math just revealed a 1-point hit to our revenue. So it's fairly straightforward math for us. And since then, obviously, some things have changed. The sequester got moved out a few months, and its impact would be less than the 8%. And that's how you end up with the guidance we're now providing.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Yes, I think that's it in a nutshell. The one thing I would add is, we've said that our exposure to U.S. government funding is somewhere between 10% and 15%, depending on the level of funding, the year, et cetera. In this environment, our latest calculation is that it's closer to 10%. So the 1% assumes the higher end, 15%, times the full sequester cut of 8%, and that gives us the 1% headwind to our total revenue growth. So I think that there's a little cushion in there for us. Although, David, as you've pointed out in some of your reports, some of the lab or research spending is fixed cost. So more of it may take out of discretionary. And that's how we think we've got it covered, or hope we've got it covered, is in that difference between 10%, which is what we think our real exposure is, and the 15% we've used in the calculation.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "One of your large NGS competitors recently did an acquisition in the reproductive health area. I'm curious, have you seen that impact demand for your NGS instruments?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "That acquisition has impacted our sale of instruments to the positive. There were other companies in that space, other partners that they had in that space that saw that as a competitive affront. And it has opened up all new channels of discussion of opportunity for us.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "Can you give us an update on Ion Torrent box pricing, how the ASPs are holding up? And then also, I know you were doing some catch-up on installations. What -- if you can give us an update on the progress there, that'd be appreciated.", "Mark P. Stevenson", "Yes, the first question on the ASPs on the instruments, they've remained approximately the same as we've gone throughout the year. So between the early access site that we did initially, and further units as replaced, the approximate ASP has remained fairly constant throughout the year. I think what's also has surprised many investors is the number of units, also on the PGM, remained approximately the same this last year to 2011. So we see a continued uptake for the 2 sort of price points, where people want to get into a benchtop unit at the PGM price into a panel of genes, or where people want to get into a desktop unit and do with the PI chip transcriptome for next subs.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "And then the installations on Proton?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "And part of the installations, we've now caught up with the majority of the ones that we shipped at the end of the third quarter. We did ship a large number at the end of the fourth quarter. We're still working through some of those installations and training, pretty much as we did with the PGM. It does take some time for someone to get, both in-store to be proficient, and then we're working with those customers as they continue to improve their performance, as we continue its rate and improve the system. It's a continued, very fast ramp. And so you'll continue to see improvement just as we've done on the III series chip, as we launch with the PI chip and install the Protons.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Actually, maybe just really a quick follow-up to Dan's first question. Did you say PGM placements in 2012 were about the same as 2011 as the answer to the ASP question? Does that basically mean that ASPs on both Proton and PGM held up pretty well over the course of the year?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "In terms of the ASP, it did hold up for the year. And in terms of the units, it was approximately the same number, yes.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, just a few clarifying questions on guidance. I guess this is just kind of a little mini guidance lightning round, if you will. What's the -- first, what's the PCR royalty headwinds you expect in 2013? Second, when do you expect Ion to get to break even? Is this still by year-end at the Operating Line? Third, R&D spend declined 4% year-over-year in 2012, and declined nominally Q3 to Q4. Based on your commentary on operating spend, should we expect this to reverse a little bit in 2013? And the last one, Q1 revenue is typically a lot lower than Q4, due to normal seasonality. Q1 guidance, obviously, incorporates that same trend. But were you a bit were conservative due to sequestration or any other dynamics that you might have seen in Q4?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "Okay. So let me see if I've got all these. And if I don't capture all of them, Doug, just reask the question. So qPCR royalty headwind in 2013, we're expecting to be $15 million, okay? Ion Torrent profitability, we expect it to hit breakeven to slightly above by the end of the year. R&D, we're expecting R&D, as a percent of sales, to be basically flat. And then, let me see, Q1, your question was, it tends to be lower than Q4, and we expect that, that basic pattern to hold for next year. And did we factor any other conservativism in there? I think the basic thing is -- no, I think what we expected, basically stable markets with the impact of sequestration is primarily what's driving our outlook for Q1. Mark, do you want to add anything there?", "Mark P. Stevenson", "That covers it.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You got all 4, David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I think, David, just a couple of quick questions. Around sequestration, what would be the bottom line impact? And then on the emerging markets, what's the scale of that business that drove that double-digit growth?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "So on the sequestration, basically there the rough math is, 1% on the top line, at standard company margins of 65%, 66%, that would be the flow-through to the bottom line. The emerging markets, so could you just elaborate that -- on your question there?", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I was just -- you mentioned in the prepared script about driving double-digit growth. How big is that revenue?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "For all of our emerging markets? Our emerging markets are roughly 10% to 15% of our total revenue.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from the line of Vamil Divan with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So a couple of quick ones. One on the emerging markets, just following up on that last point. You mentioned some of the deals you did this year in China and Chile. Just wondering, should we expect more of those sorts of acquisitions as you grow out there and which countries maybe would you, could you highlight? And then the second one, just quickly on taxes. You mentioned the benefit of the R&D tax credits sliding from last year to this quarter. Just curious, what else is going on there? Just surprised that the full year rate maybe wasn't a little bit lower. And how we should think about that rate going forward?", "Gregory T. Lucier", "I'll take the first one. Dave, you take the tax question. Or Ronnie, do you want the tax question?", "David F. Hoffmeister", "I'll take that one.", "Gregory T. Lucier", "All right, just checking. In 2013, we have a roadmap of a number of countries where we will either build or buy, and to create a broader distribution capability in that particular country. So I think it's a safe assumption you'll hear a few more acquisitions in terms of expanding our commercial footprint in 2013.", "David F. Hoffmeister", "And on the tax rate, basically, it's a case of lower income in some of our -- lower income, as a percentage of our total income, in some lower tax jurisdictions. So for example, many of our instruments, qPCR instruments and our -- will be our Ion Torrent instruments, we're going to manufacture in Singapore. Sale of those instruments, as I said, in a funding-constrained environment, have grown less than they would have, and that's impacting our effective tax rate.", "Carol A. Cox", "Okay, great. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our fourth quarter and full year 2002 (sic) [ 2012 ] Earnings Conference Call. As always, if you have any additional questions, please just contact us here directly at the company. The webcast replay will be available on our website for the next 3 weeks.

On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note that this call is being webcast live, and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until May 17, 2013. A copy of the press release of our 2013 first quarter earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

So with that, I will now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our first quarter earnings call. We're very pleased to report a solid Q1, and we'll go through the business highlights in a few minutes as we usually do. But before I discuss the quarter, I want to spend a moment on our exciting announcement last week of our agreement to acquire Life Technologies. This acquisition represents the largest transaction for our company since the merger that created Thermo Fisher Scientific. It will make us an unrivaled leader in our industry, serving customers in research, Specialty Diagnostics and applied markets. Combining the leader in genomics with the leader in proteomics will establish technology and innovation leadership across key life sciences markets. The transaction also expands our commercial infrastructure and global presence, making us the ultimate partner for our customers. We're going out to Carlsbad next week to meet with the members of the Life Technologies team and begin the integration planning. As we said last Monday, we look forward to completing the transaction early in 2014.", "With that, I'll now move onto our Q1 results, starting with our financial performance, which is what we're focused on discussing today. As you read in our press release, we continued our trend of consistently delivering strong double-digit adjusted EPS growth in Q1. We had a 17% increase year-over-year that set a new record. Revenue was a first quarter record, growing 4% over last year. In terms of our adjusted operating income, we grew 7% with 40 basis points of operating margin expansion. So we performed well and in line with our expectations, even though the underlying market conditions were challenging. Two factors, in particular, created more pressure on the top line: first, sequestration took effect in the U.S. in early March, as we had assumed it would; and second, we haven't seen a recovery in global industrial markets. In fact, some have weakened. As a result of these factors, we've implemented some additional contingency actions. I am pleased to say that our teams executed very well to deliver solid performance in Q1.", "Let me briefly describe what we saw in our key end markets in the first 3 months of the year relative to the expectations we laid out for you during our last call. From an overall perspective, I would say that the dynamics in our key end markets played out at the lower end of what we factored into our guidance range for the year.", "Starting with academic and government, we're obviously now living in a world of sequestration. Our customers were bracing for it. We anticipated it and we planned for it. We saw a slight decline in Q1, and we continue to see the impact more in our capital equipment businesses and less so on the consumables side. Growth was also slightly negative in industrial and applied markets. Bookings softness continued, primarily in our businesses serving core industrial applications. However, we continue to see pockets of strength in applied markets. One example is the very strong demand for our products used in environmental applications, especially in China, and I'll give you more details on that in a few moments.", "Turning to health care and diagnostics. Our performance continues to be driven by strong demand for our novel biomarker tests and our clinical diagnostic products, and we saw some benefit from the flu as well. We grew here during Q1, in line with the company average. Last, pharma and biotech was the end market that once again really stood out for us in the quarter. Market conditions were fairly similar to what we've been seeing for quite some time, but our businesses serving this customer set performed extremely well. We grew here in the high single digits as we have for the past several quarters. Our clinical trials logistics business was the key contributor, with another outstanding quarter. It's clear that our outsourcing services are creating tremendous value for these customers.", "We also continued to see strength in our BioProcess Production business, driven by demand for our single-use technologies used to produce biotherapeutics, biosimilars and vaccines. Our outperformance in this end market contributed to our good top line growth for the quarter overall.  So in summary, our teams executed very well in a challenging environment to ensure that we met our goals for growth. We continue to keep a sharp eye on costs so we can fund our key growth initiatives in technology innovation, our value proposition and expansion in emerging markets.", "I'll now use our 3 growth drivers as a framework to cover some of the many business highlights we had in Q1. I always like to start with technology innovation because it is the lifeblood of our company. Our leading portfolio of products and services gives us a unique value proposition for our customers, and we are committed to building on that. We had an excellent start to the year with a strong lineup of new Thermo Scientific products launched at Pittcon. There were numerous introductions across our Analytical Technologies platform, but I'll highlight just a few this morning. The most significant development was the new version of our Chromeleon chromatography data system, which you probably know is the industry's gold standard. We've now significantly raised the bar with Chromeleon 7.2, which allows our mass spectrometry and chromatography systems to be controlled on a single data platform for the first time. This is a huge advance for our customers because these instruments can now be linked across their enterprise so they can share vast amounts of data. This is a real benefit for large universities and pharmaceutical researchers who want to facilitate collaboration between laboratories.", "Turning to Applied Markets. We launched new elemental and spectroscopy systems that build on our leading platforms by adopting research-grade tools for use in any lab. We strengthened our highly successful iCAP elemental analysis platform with the launch of the new iCAP 7000. It incorporates a unique, high-resolution CID imager to detect lower levels of harmful trace elements such as lead, mercury and chromium. Customers need this level of sensitivity to meet increasingly strict global regulatory standards for food, drinking water and soil. Also making its Pittcon debut was the picoSpin 45 miniature NMR spectrometer, which is our first NMR product offering.", "In addition to Pittcon, we launched new products across our portfolio during the quarter. Let me mention 2 from our Specialty Diagnostics business. First, we introduced the Brilliance GBS test in Europe, which rapidly identifies Group B strep, a severe infection that can be passed from mother to baby during delivery. Another new test, the  SureTect system, makes it easier for food safety laboratories to quickly detect bacterial pathogens in food products before they're released to the market. As you know, we're a company that's committed to innovation to help our customers meet their goals. This promises to be another excellent year on that front, and we're looking forward to announcing new breakthroughs at the upcoming American Society of Mass Spectrometry Conference in June.", "Our second key growth driver, our unique value proposition, comes from the combination of our leading technologies, our customer channels and our applications expertise. Let me give you a great recent example. Harvard Medical School has been a long-time customer of ours, mostly for our analytical instruments used in protein research. We're now collaborating with the university to establish the new Thermo Fisher Center for multiplexed proteomics, to accelerate progress in proteome analysis. Harvard Med will use our hybrid Orbitrap mass spectrometry systems and our protein reagents and kits to conduct the research. With our help, Harvard will also provide training courses to the scientific community to help foster growth of these important new methods in life science research. This is another example of how our customers rely on us as a partner to help them meet their goals for both innovation and productivity.", "Now let me turn to some of the highlights during the quarter in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, our third key growth driver. As I mentioned earlier, we continued our excellent momentum in China, with our teams there delivering 20% growth in Q1. Our leading scale in the region is a key competitive advantage for us, and has resulted in some significant customer wins. Three markets, in particular, contributed to our Asia-Pacific performance in the quarter. First, environmental markets continue to be very strong, as the Chinese government expands its particulate air monitoring network to its Tier 2 cities. This has created significant new opportunities for our PM-2.5 particulate monitoring instruments. In addition, we're leading the market in meeting increasing needs for technologies that address heavy metals monitoring in water and soil as well. Second, the China Food and Drug Administration placed a large order for our Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC systems used for food safety testing. And third, we saw strong growth in our Specialty Diagnostics businesses in China as a result of our commercial focus on helping customers improve health care. For example, we're working closely with local hospitals to train them to use our biomarker test for diagnosing and treating sepsis.", "One last comment on emerging markets. We had strong growth in Brazil in Q1, driven by the recent approval of the country's government stimulus budget, which is fueling industrial markets and academic research. We're also seeing increased spending by the healthcare industry and this is reflected in our strong sales there to large testing labs.  So to summarize, our growth strategy is clearly working, and our scale and unique depth of capabilities continues to differentiate us and give us new opportunities to gain share.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me make some comments on our guidance for the year. At a high-level, we have these 2 new data points. First, we delivered good revenue and adjusted EPS growth in Q1; and second, we've decided to suspend share buybacks in light of our pending acquisition of Life Technologies, which will impact our adjusted EPS. Pete will get into the details, but the take away on our updated guidance is we're raising the low end of our revenue range by $40 million to reflect our good growth in Q1, resulting in 3% to 4% growth year-over-year, and we're updating our adjusted EPS range to reflect the suspension of our share buybacks and our updated revenue guidance. The new range will result in 7% to 9% growth over 2012.", "So to summarize, we had a solid quarter. Our teams executed well, in spite of the underlying market conditions, to deliver good top line growth and double-digit adjusted EPS performance. We're pleased that we carried our growth momentum into 2013 and we're very excited about our future outlook.", "With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Pete.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As Marc said, we had a solid Q1, driven largely by strong operational execution by our teams around the globe. I'm very pleased with our results this quarter given the macro environment.  So I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the total company, and then provide some color on each of our 3 segments before moving on to guidance. As you saw in our press release, we delivered another quarter of solid top and bottom line results with a 17% increase in adjusted EPS to a record of $1.37. GAAP EPS in Q1 was $0.93, up 24% from $0.75 in Q1 last year.", "Looking at the top line, Q1 total revenue increased 4% year-over-year and we delivered 3% organic growth. Q1 reported revenue includes 3% growth from acquisitions and a 1% headwind from FX. And as in some previous quarters, the revenue components I just mentioned do not sum due to rounding. In terms of bookings, we continued to strengthen our backlog, with bookings exceeding revenue by about 1% in the quarter. By geography, North America grew in the low single digits. Europe was just slightly negative, and consistent with previous quarters. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits, with China coming in very strong once again at over 20% growth. Rest of world grew in the mid-teens.", "Turning to the bottom line. Q1 adjusted operating income was up 7% and adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Once again, this quarter, we had very strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions, which was partially offset by unfavorable mix and foreign exchange, specifically the weakening of the Japanese yen. I told you on our Q4 call that we expected to realize $65 million of benefit this year from the $100 million restructuring program that we initiated in 2011 and the $75 million program that we initiated last year. And in March, as a result of sequestration being implemented in the U.S., we triggered an additional $10 million of contingency cost actions, which increases the total expected impact of restructuring actions in 2013 to $75 million. In total, we realized about $20 million of benefit from these actions in Q1.  Consistent with last year, we made strategic investments this quarter, primarily in emerging markets to strengthen our global presence and continue our growth momentum there.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44% in Q1, down 90 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of unfavorable mix and the medical device tax, partially offset by acquisitions. As I mentioned, we delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, which was driven by our primary productivity levers: Global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 21.7% of revenue, down 130 basis points from the 2012 quarter as a result of volume leverage and our restructuring actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 3.1% of revenue, up 10 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of acquisitions. Below the line, net interest expense in Q1 was $57 million, $6 million above last year, as a result of the debt we issued in Q3 2012 to fund the One Lambda acquisition. Adjusted other income was $3 million, up $1 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of non-operating currency translation gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 11.7%, 590 basis points lower than last year, as a result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax planning efforts. And as planned, we recognized the benefit of both the full year 2012 and the first quarter 2013 R&D tax credits in the quarter. We also realized about $15 million of foreign tax credit benefit specific to Q1 that had already been included in our previous full-year guidance. In terms of return of capital, during the quarter, we spent $90 million to buy back 1.3 million shares of our stock, and paid out $54 million in dividends to our shareholders. Average diluted shares were 361.7 million in the quarter, down 8.4 million or 2% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our share buyback programs.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations was $299 million and free cash flow was $236 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $63 million. Free cash flow in Q1 was down from the prior year, primarily as a result of higher working capital investment from a low year end base. We anticipate working capital performance to improve throughout the year and haven't changed our full-year view. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash and investments, up $153 million from Q4, and our total debt at the end of Q1 was $7.12 billion, essentially flat with Q4.  To wrap up my comments on the total company, I wanted to provide you with a quick update on our return on invested capital performance. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the first quarter of 2013 was 9.6%, up 25 basis points from Q4. Given our recent acquisition of One Lambda in Q3 2012, this gives you an indication of the strength of returns in the underlying business.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of each of our 3 business segments. Before I get into the details, please note that during the quarter, we made a minor change in our segment reporting to better align like businesses within our segments. The full year impact results in a shift from Analytical Technologies to Laboratory Products and Services of around $100 million in revenue and $20 million in adjusted operating income. All prior period numbers have been restated and are detailed in the reconciliation package on our website.", "Starting with Analytical Technologies, in Q1, total revenue was flat and organic revenue increased 1%. In the quarter, we saw strong growth in our BioProcess Production, mass spec and air quality businesses. This is partially offset by the softness we've been experiencing in some of our industrial markets, which are more highly represented in this segment. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies decreased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 18%, down 20 basis points.  During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which was offset by unfavorable product mix, strategic investments and foreign exchange.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 2% and organic growth was 4%. We continued to deliver strong growth in our clinical diagnostics business, including biomarkers, and in general, we delivered good growth across the segment, and our microbiology and healthcare market channel businesses benefited from a strong flu season.", "In Q1, adjusted operating income in the segment increased 19% with adjusted operating margin at 27.5%, up 200 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of strong productivity, acquisitions and nice volume pull through. This was partially offset by strategic investments and the medical device tax. In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, total revenue grew 5% and organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter, as Marc mentioned, our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver strong growth, which was partially offset by continued weakness in our laboratory products businesses. As you know, the muted conditions in the academic and government end market are a big factor in this segment.  Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.1%, down 20 basis points, driven by strategic investments and unfavorable mix.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2013 guidance. Please note that, as we stated in the press release, our 2013 guidance does not include the acquisition of Life Technologies or the impact of related financing activities. On the top line, with the quarter behind us, we're raising the low end of our revenue range by $40 million. This leads to a new revenue guidance range of $12.84 billion to $13.0 billion, which represents reported growth of 3% to 4%. On an organic basis, we're still guiding to growth of about 1% to 3%, consistent with our previous guidance. Completed acquisitions will contribute about 1.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2013, no change from our previous guidance. And the negative FX impact on our top line has deteriorated slightly to a little less than 0.5%. However, we're now expecting a more significant unfavorable bottom line impact from FX as a result of the mix of currencies, in particular, the weakening Japanese yen. Specifically, we're expecting an incremental FX headwind of approximately 20 basis points of margin and $0.07 on adjusted EPS versus our previous guidance. We plan to fully offset this with increased productivity, so we're not changing our margin or adjusted EPS guidance as a result of this headwind. Also, as we mentioned in the press release, we're suspending our share buyback program as a result of our recently announced acquisition of Life Technologies. We expect this to create another $0.07 headwind in our adjusted EPS versus our previous guidance, as a result of higher diluted shares.", "So to summarize the change in our full-year 2013 adjusted EPS guidance, we're decreasing both the high and low end of our range by $0.07 to reflect suspension of our buyback program, but importantly, we're maintaining our previous operational guidance and tightening the low end of the range by $0.02, consistent with the tightening of our revenue range. This results in a revised adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.27 to $5.39, which represents 7% to 9% growth over 2012. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin. We're expecting expansion of 30 to 50 basis points, consistent with our previous guidance, although the high-end is somewhat less likely as a result of the FX headwinds that I mentioned previously.  Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be consistent with our previous guidance, and we're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15%, consistent with our previous guidance. We're assuming that we'll return a total of about $310 million of capital to shareholders, composed of the $90 million in share buybacks that we completed in Q1 and about $220 million in dividends for the year. This is down about $500 million from our previous guidance as a result of our decision to suspend share buybacks. Therefore, our full-year average diluted shares are now estimated to be in the range of 365 -- 363 million to 365 million, up 5 million from our previous guidance. Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $325 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, no change from our previous guidance. In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance range, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year, as well as the economic factors we've discussed.", "In summary, we once again managed through the macro environment, executed well and delivered good revenue growth and very strong adjusted EPS. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'm just wondering if you can give us a sense of how things trended throughout the quarter. Obviously, the macro data got a little bit worse toward the end of the quarter. So can you give us a sense of the monthly progression of trends, in particular, on the industrial business?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. I would say that, as you look at the industrial businesses, Tycho, they continue to be soft for us. We declined in the low single digits, and we didn't see an inflection point in the quarter. So as I look at the 3 months, basically remained weak. Bookings were softer than revenue for our industrial customer base. So it was pretty consistent as a soft end market, so we haven't seen that positive turn yet.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then you guys didn't call out the 2 fewer days for LPS. Was that just lost in the noise or was there any impact you can quantify from 2 fewer selling days or fewer selling days, I guess?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think we've learned over the years that when you start talking about billing days, it gets in a circle that is not worth doing. Yes, there were some impact from billing days, but you had some things like the flu that helped and other offsets. So I think it's all lost in the noise.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then on pharma, you're putting up great numbers for that business. Are there larger contract wins that are coming through? And one of your competitors mentioned some delays on the equipment side. Is that anything that you've experienced as well?", "Marc N. Casper", "So on the pharmaceutical and biotech customers, this is driven by really share of wallet with the existing customers. It's not about big customer wins. It's about just expanding the impact that we're having with our customers, and we clearly are gaining good momentum. I would say that our value proposition is really resonating quite well with that customer set. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the greatest strength has really been in the clinical trials, logistics and BioProcess Production. We saw some good progress in instrumentation, but clearly softer than those other 2 businesses.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, any longer-term thoughts on the dividend? I know, obviously, you're building up cash now for the deal. But as we think about the longer-term delevering story, any thoughts on the dividend on a go-forward basis?", "Marc N. Casper", "From a capital deployment standpoint, as we highlighted last week, our intention, once we close the Life transaction, is to spend the first 2 years in the mode of debt repayment to get our leverage ratios back to our target of between 2.5x and 3x leverage, and after that, returning back to our more historical returns of capital. I would say that when we look at the world today, if we were right -- if we were through that period of close the transaction, did our 2 years of debt repayment, we would have a higher emphasis on dividends than buybacks. So I think that's -- would be appropriate, but I think given that we're talking probably 2.5 years out, what you're going to hear is a strong commitment on return of capital. As it gets closer, we'll refine our thinking. We plan on continuing to focus on increasing our dividends in line with our growth and earnings in the meantime.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So as you were debating sort of what to do with the guidance, obviously, lots of sort of pushes and pulls here. You had FX go against you and the macro, as you said, sort of challenging. You had the sequester. And then on the positive side, you've obviously turned on the sort of restructuring spigot a little more and pulled in a bit more cost. But as you were trying to debate where the biggest sort of deltas, as we go throughout the year, sort of positive and negative are, and I think that's a pretty good outcome relative to what many have expected given some of the commentary, where do you feel like the biggest wiggle room is, sort of the upside or downside, given sort of all these moving parts?", "Marc N. Casper", "So Ross, thanks for the question. First of all, the big factor is, one way or another, that's going to swing the results off of the midpoint, is going to be the strength of the end markets, right. So if we see a positive inflection point in industrials or negative, that's going to be a major swing factor. And then obviously, if there's ever a resolution later in the year on sequestration of some sort, that obviously can be a positive swing factor as well. So that's -- more of the end markets is going to be the delta. As we went through that process of thinking about guidance, basically, our conclusion was the team executed extremely well. We had been taking restructuring actions, as we mentioned at the beginning of the year. We had some additional ones ready to go, should U.S. government not be able to solve sequestration. So things that we just wanted to get a definitive view on, and we implemented those actions. So yes, I mean, the world has its challenges. The end markets are on the lower end of our guidance. The Japanese yen is a real headwind, but our team is doing a real good job of gaining share in biopharma and managing the cost base well. So that's how we thought about our guidance for the year.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And from an end market perspective, I appreciate all the commentary you gave. I guess where were you sort of most surprised by the magnitude of weakness or softness? And how well do you feel like you're doing relative to peers in terms of both share gains, just from utilizing sort of size, scale and channel in what is a tougher environment, as we heard from several customers, the desire to use Thermo as more as their preferred supplier in new areas given some of the budget pressures? And then also from the new product standpoint, where you highlighted a ton of new instruments, et cetera, where you're really kind of thought leading and driving some new innovation?", "Marc N. Casper", "I would say that our customers are clearly looking for ways to navigate their own funding challenges, and that is a huge advantage for us. And as we've said for a while, we really optimized the commercial relationship with our big biopharma customers, and then have expanded it to other customer sets. So I think we're particularly well-positioned to grow with customers that are trying to drive productivity and accelerate innovation. So I feel very good about that. And I think the results there show, at least in the biopharma, show that we clearly are performing extremely well relative to the market, where I would think the market growth is quite muted in that customer set.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Daniel Brennan with Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Marc, I wanted to dig back in just one more question on kind of industrial. I know you cited in the -- in your prepared remarks, I believe, China's strong, environmental looked good. So I just wanted to understand a bit more. When you mentioned industrial, is it any particularly geographies? Is it -- within industrial, any more color, maybe food testing, maybe more pure industrial? Just kind of looking for the color on kind of where the weakness resides.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, when you look at our customer set, we have industrial and we have applied markets there, right. So industrial was generally soft around the world, softest in Europe of that group, but generally soft. And if you get down to a further level of detail, kind of the basic infrastructure type products that we provide, certain metals and scrap and those types of things, were soft in the quarter, as a representative example. So that's -- basically what we see now for a couple of quarters is a continued soft market. On applied, there were some interesting pockets of strength, which is also consistent with what we've seen. Food safety continues to be very positive and very good, as I mentioned in my thoughts about China, and environmental's doing very well for us. The publicity in terms of the air quality problems in China, in particular, but elsewhere as well, is leading to very, very strong growth for us in a very attractive market.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. Maybe a follow-up just kind of on the sequester. What's your latest intelligence telling you how your U.S. economic customers are behaving in particular? How much of an impact do you think you've been feeling now versus the pacing of the spending as the year unfolds?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when we talk to -- we talk to a lot of our customers obviously, and in the academic and government, we think that as the year continues on, it will get more challenging, because, effectively, we only had 1 month of sequestration in Q1. So when you look at it, we declined just slightly in the quarter, and when you remember back to our February guidance, we said we expect low single-digit declines in that customer set. So we're expecting, as you have the typical 3 months of sequestration in each of the remaining quarters, that end market's a little bit tighter and that's how we've been planning and why we took some additional contingency actions.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And your next question is from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "The incremental $10 million of belt tightening you guys did in March, should demand remain softer, get worse? How much availability is there to find additional restructurings this year?", "Marc N. Casper", "So a couple of things. The $10 million -- we did a lot more than $10 million in terms of belt tightening, right. We've done a lot of things in addition, but when we called out the $10 million, that's pure restructuring-type activities. So we obviously manage our costs quite tightly, Steve. But as end markets get more and more muted, you continue to get tighter and tighter so that you're protecting the quality of the company going forward. We have 39,000 amazing employees here. So that belt tightening happens first, and then restructuring is a secondary type set of actions. So right now, we're doing what we think is the right level for the end markets, and obviously if the end markets get to a more challenging situation, we'll do what's appropriate for the long-term health of the company.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Okay. And then can you just provide an update on how some of your recent acquisitions are performing like Phadia, Dionex and One Lambda?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So if we look at the 3 acquisitions, clearly, Dionex is, from an ROIC perspective, is moving ahead of schedule versus the model. Phadia is pretty much on track, a little bit softer overall top line performance, which we've highlighted in previous calls, much better cash flow, tax planning, integration work that has offset it. One Lambda is doing quite well, is on track, and that integration has gone very smoothly. So I feel good about, in general, how those acquisitions are proceeding.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin with Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Marc, I know you guys aren't -- I wanted to just sort of have the general philosophical question with you in terms of R&D spend and R&D focus, particularly as you started thinking about the Life transaction. I just -- I know I'm just -- I'm curious just in terms of general ways you're sort of going to look at the business and I'm trying to figure out -- I'm just looking at your core Thermo business right know. How much of your general R&D spend goes into high-end molecular cellular biology reagents? How much goes in Analytical Technologies, how much goes into diagnostics? I'm just curious about how you allocate it, and if that's a general guide we can think about for the Life transaction once that's come in.", "Marc N. Casper", "That's a great question. I would say that if you look at our current spend, the majority of our R&D spend is in our analytical instruments businesses. We spend substantial R&D dollars to support our chromatography and mass spectrometry portfolio, and as you know, it's done very well over the years. We obviously have a number of R&D programs that are significant in things like developing next-generation biomarkers, our new novel biomarkers and a number of technologies across Specialty Diagnostics. When you look at our Biosciences portfolio, there, we obviously have a smaller level of spend, and we'll look at ways to take the best thinking between the combined companies with Life Technologies over time and the integration, to develop really interesting novel products that make a difference for our customers. I would say that the integration teams will work to optimize how we want to spend R&D going forward, and we're looking forward to kicking off that process, really in earnest, starting next week.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Okay. That's helpful. Also, I'm just curious in your clinical trial logistics. I mean, that's -- as I think about the company over the years and just commentary on the business, I mean, I know that was something that you guys -- that was picked up a number of years ago. And I guess, could you just give us a size about what that business is right now and sort of what the growth rate's been and who you compete with it. I just don't really -- I'm just looking for an update on the business, given it's been such a strong driver over the last few quarters.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, order of magnitude, $800-ish million business, in that kind of range. It's growing consistently high single digits well into the double-digit growth, is what we've been experiencing there. We don't really have much competition. We're probably 3x to 4x the next largest competitor. Mostly, it's about customers taking in-house activities and driving that activity to us. Why this business is doing so well is, effectively, we've used our scale to build the highest quality, lowest-cost provider of these services. So we simply are able to do this more effectively than the in-house capabilities, and more and more of our customers are relying on us for that activity. So it's been a really excellent organic growth story for us for quite a number of years, and we feel good about how our team is executing there to build out that business.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And then just one final sort of end-market question, given talking about outsourcing, have you seen an increase in demand from your CRO customers?", "Marc N. Casper", "Nothing that jumps outs particularly, either on the positive or negative, in terms of what's going on with our CRO base.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen and Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You indicated, Marc, that you're heading out to Carlsbad next week, pursuant to getting the integration process of Life going. What update should investors expect from Thermo between now and deal closing? And what has early feedback been from customers you've spoken with on the deal?", "Marc N. Casper", "So, Doug, in terms of when we get to major milestones, we'll definitely provide updates. So as we get through the major ones, we'll do that. In terms of the customer feedback, basically, the message -- I've spoken to a number of customers and the feedback is they're really looking forward to working with us once the transaction closes. So it's very good.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. Mass spec was an important growth driver for you last year, where, I think, again, you grew above the market. You have a very big share position there anyway, but it seemed like you were gaining share last year at the high end. Any changes in those dynamics in Q1 or was it really just a continuation of the momentum you had last year?", "Marc N. Casper", "We had very strong growth in Q1 in our life sciences mass spec business so I think our team is executing very well.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And last question, what growth rate expectations have you factored into full year guidance by end market and geography?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So I'll answer that one. In terms of the end markets, it's basically very similar or the same as what we had in our last quarter call. So pharma and biotech, kind of mid- to high- single digits; academic and government, down low single digits; industrial and applied, flat to down low single digits; and health care and diagnostics, low- to mid-single digits; and then in North America, low single digits; Europe, bordering around flat; Asia Pacific, mid- to high- single digits and the rest of the world, low double digits.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Dan Arias with UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe just to go back on the end markets. Marc, on the academic demand, to what extent have the haves and the have-nots sort of separated in terms of buying? Have the more established universities and labs sort of emerged as more resilient spenders or does the softness pretty much evenly apply across the accounts?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think it's a little too soon to tell how that's going to -- if that's going to -- bifurcate is going to happen or not. We didn't see a particular pattern. Obviously, our scientific advisory board is made up of those folks that come out of the really premier universities, and I have a huge amount of dialogue with them. And they articulated that they are feeling some of the pressure as well. So I'm not sure that we have haves and have-nots. I think people are being mindful of their budgets.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just to go back to the industrial side, obviously, more CapEx-intensive focus there. But for the consumable lines that are going into the markets that are soft, just curious how the recurring revenue streams have held up there. Are they generally at the company average?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, I mean, there's not a lot of consumable business in industrial. It's a very, very small piece of that business.", "Marc N. Casper", "It's more services supporting the instrumentation, and generally, that's held up okay.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Knight with CLSA.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "You had mentioned that the laboratory products business was a driver last year. Was the continuing strength of that area, I guess, that would largely be Fisher, was that a reason for your bid on Life? And then I guess the second question would be, how is that business, continuing to do well or a little slower than last year, midyear?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so in terms of our lab products and services segment, it's made up of 3 businesses: our channel, our lab products business, our Biopharma Services business. Clearly, Biopharma Services, which is the clinical trials outsourcing business, is doing very well. The other businesses are doing fine, but feel more pressure from the academic and government muted spending, so they feel that pressure, and I think that they are doing a good job of executing in that more challenging environment. The combination between the 2 companies is really more focused on the higher tech aspects of our business. It's really the combination of the strength of our Specialty Diagnostics, our Analytical Technologies and Life Technologies creating an innovation powerhouse. There obviously are some customer benefits. It's very powerful to have the leading e-commerce channel, which we have from the broad catalog view with the leading e-commerce channel that Life Technologies brings from a customer application view. Having that all in one company is incredibly compelling, and our job, once we close the transaction, will be to really bring that benefit to life, no pun intended, for our customers, so that they can shop by workflow and buy what they need or they can shop a broad set of capabilities through our channel and get it that way. So it's more of the holistic view of putting the companies together, is how we thought about it.", "Paul R. Knight - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division", "Is the combination of the 2 e-channels -- is that a very, very obvious synergy and a very obvious cost savings?", "Marc N. Casper", "It's less of a cost savings in that particular case. There are other things that will drive our cost efficiencies, but it's more about giving customers the easiest way to buy things. And I think maybe to make the example most real is, there's a lot of shop by experiment, shop by application capabilities within the Life Technologies e-commerce platform, and there are many things that we produce at Thermo Fisher, in our chemicals and in our lab consumables, that are very naturally used in those workflows, which Life Technologies doesn't make today. So you can imagine a customer just adding different things to their shopping cart simply because that's how they want to do the experiment, and I think that gives us a really nice share gain opportunity over time.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Vamil Divan with Credit Suisse.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "So I just wanted to go back on talking about the Life acquisition, and you mentioned some of the initial feedback you've been getting from some of their customers. I guess it's a little bit different than what we were hearing. So I'm just curious more on the, I guess, specifically on their sequencing side of things where I think there's been a lot of focus. Is there anything specific you can share in terms of what you've been hearing from customers? It seems from what we're hearing and also from what we've been reading, I think,  there's a fair number of questions as to kind of how that will blend into your business and how that might evolve over time. So anything specific you can share on that front?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, not really. I mean, if you think about the relationships that we have, I mean, customers like working with us. We have great relationships. A lot of the calls were inbound, just congratulating us. A few of them were outbound from [ph]  me as a courtesy, but it's more about their enthusiasm post-close to talk about this stuff. On the sequencing side, it's obviously -- it's an exciting business, but we're not getting into that level of granularity. We're still 2 separate companies and focused on each running our own businesses.", "Vamil Divan - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division", "Okay. And then one specific question, you mentioned the sepsis biomarker, I think you mentioned in China, it's doing pretty well if I caught your comments correctly. I know your Analyst Day last year, you talked about that product quite a bit, and I was just wondering if you've seen any increased traction in the U.S. with that biomarker.", "Marc N. Casper", "The answer is yes. I mean, it is gaining traction in the U.S. as well. Interestingly enough, the uptick in China is spectacular, and I think it's a matter of really trying to triage patients very quickly in the ER setting. We had very good success across the country of getting the opinion leaders to just go from hospital to hospital and basically articulate why the sepsis screening, right up front for a very sick patient, why dealing with it that way makes sense. So we've seen huge demand. In the U.S., we're going through the traditional market development process that we have for all of our other -- our assays, and we clearly are seeing good growth as well.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Amit Bhalla with Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Marc, I just want to come back to industrials for a second. I know you're talking about seeing some softness overall, but in the past, you've also said that your business is a 6-month lag to what's happening in larger industrial companies. Can you tie that to the expectations later in the year for the cadence of your organic growth rate related to industrial weakness?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. What I would say is, in my commentary specifically, that the bookings continue to be soft, means, especially given the lead times of this, that certainly, the conditions here are going to continue to be similar, at least for the next quarter, and it's a little less clear if we're going to see an inflection point for later in the year. We haven't assumed one in how we thought about our guidance so -- but we haven't seen any signs yet that we're seeing a positive turn.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "But you don't think it gets worse later in the year because of your lag?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, so in the second half of the year, we do have a little bit easier comps. So if it stays at this level or deteriorates, we can basically hold our current organic growth rate in industrial.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then second, you brought up the Brazil stimulus. Can you put some numbers behind that and what kind of contribution you expect there?", "Marc N. Casper", "That business is growing. Rates right now are similar to what we're seeing in China. So it's a much smaller business, but doing quite well.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And just clean up for you, Pete, the device tax impact?", "Peter M. Wilver", "It's about 15 basis points in the quarter, as we had expected. It's pretty much flat across the year, so that's the same number for the full year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "First one had to do with just pricing. Wondering if you can maybe comment, Pete, on how much that contributed to growth this quarter. And then if you look at sort of the outlook for the balance of the year, what your expectations are for pricing?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So pricing is pretty consistent with what we've been seeing, really, for the last couple of years. We did have positive price in the quarter, less than 50 basis points contribution to the growth rate. But it did contribute positively to the bottom line, and I would expect that to be the case for the rest of the year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great. And then just one business-specific item on Phadia. I think you mentioned a little softer growth there, and as I recall, I mean, it is coming off some relatively easy comps in the first half of this year. So wondering if you can give us some more detail. Was it a function of the exposure you have to Southern Europe or is it something else? Just curious how should we think about growth in that part of the business for the balance of the year.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, we did have a good quarter, in terms of the Japan pollen season was stronger certainly than last year. We do have large exposure to Southern Europe. That's been a headwind for us. So I think we are factoring in for the rest of the year, Southern Europe continues to be soft, but the key growth drivers continue to develop positively as the year unfolds.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Peter Lawson with Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "Peter, I'm just wondering if you could give a better breakout on the gross margin pressure this quarter from the mix and med device taxes and FX, please?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Sure. I mean, basically, the big story was mix. In the gross margin level, it was about 100 basis points of headwind on gross margin. And then as I said, the medical device tax was about 15 basis points, so that was the big impact there. FX didn't actually impact gross margin that much in the quarter. It impacted more on the operating margin level.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "And just on capital deployment, when do you think you start the buybacks again? Is that kind of a mid-2014 event or is there particularly debt-to-EBITDA number you have to hit? And then will you be increasing the dividend?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So Marc addressed the dividend question earlier on the call, but in terms of returning to share buybacks, we're focused on paying down debt in 2014 and 2015 basically. So we wouldn't initiate any return of capital other than dividends until after we're down in that 2.5% to 3% range, which should be later in the year in 2015.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink Swann.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "I'll squeeze in one and one follow-up. So my first question, on the operating expense line. How do you think about your operating expense run rate going forward after seeing a pretty big sequential decline from fourth quarter operating expenses? And then my follow-up, your operating margin in diagnostics was very healthy in the quarter, wondering of that's sustainable.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So in terms of the SG&A percent of revenue in the quarter, that's going to pretty close approximate what we're expecting for the full year, so around 22% or a little bit under maybe. And then in terms of Specialty Diagnostics, we had very good margin in the quarter. For the full year, we would expect it to be just a little lower than that, probably in the mid-26s instead of the 27.5%.", "Marc N. Casper", "So let me wrap it up. First, we're very pleased with the start to the year with a very solid Q1 performance. I think our teams executed very well in spite of the challenging economic environment. Our growth strategy's clearly working, and it's helping us to gain share. We're clearly very excited about our pending acquisition of Life Technologies and the new opportunities that the combination will create, and certainly welcoming our new colleagues to the company after the close of the transaction. And as always, I'd like to thank you for your continued support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and we're looking forward to updating you at our Analyst Meeting in May.

Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until August 23, 2013. A copy of the press release of our 2013 second quarter earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading, Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available on the press release of our second quarter 2013 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading, Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered another solid quarter. Our growth initiatives are clearly creating value for our customers, and as always, we continue to carefully manage our costs. The result was good performance on the top and bottom line, and I'm proud of our teams for getting the job done. With a solid first half behind us, we're in a great position for the balance of the year. I'm confident that we'll continue our momentum to achieve the goals we've laid out for 2013. With that, let me move onto the highlights for the quarter, starting with the financials. Our revenue and adjusted EPS were both second quarter records. Revenues grew 4% and adjusted EPS increased 8%.", "Turning to operating income. Our adjusted operating income grew 6% and our adjusted operating margin expanded by 30 basis points. The environment is still challenging, and conditions remain similar to what we've seen during the past few quarters, but we've been very diligent as we always are about making sure that we're capitalizing on our growth initiatives and that we continue to fund them by controlling our costs. As you know, we use our PPI business system to make sure that we're delivering the best products and services to our customers as efficiently as possible. Our results clearly show that our formula is working.", "Let me take a moment now to put some color around our performance in the context of our key end markets. From a macro perspective, I would say that the dynamics are pretty consistent with what we've seen in prior quarters. Starting with academic and government, we grew here slightly in Q2. That said, our view on this end market hasn't changed and we still expect it to remain challenging for the balance of the year. This was the first full quarter of sequestration and markets in the U.S. were slightly weaker as a result. However, that was offset somewhat by growth in academic and government markets outside the United States.", "In industrial and applied markets, they remained weak overall, similar to what we saw last quarter, and again, it declined in the low single digits. Our businesses serving core industrial customers continue to face a challenging environment, and we haven't seen an inflection point yet. Applied Markets are certainly faring better than industrial for the most part and are providing some offsets here. For example, we continue to see very strong demand globally for our products used in food safety applications.", "Turning to health care and diagnostics, growth was very consistent with Q1 and remained in the low single digits. Looking at this end market by geography, we did see some effect from lower health care utilization in the U.S., but that was offset by a slight improvement in Europe. From a product perspective, we continue to see strong demand for our biomarker tests and our clinical diagnostic offerings.", "Finally, in pharma and biotech, markets were very strong for us again this quarter, and we're really strengthening our relationship with these customers and continuing to gain share. We grew here in the high single digits as we have for quite a few quarters now.", "So to sum it up, overall, our end markets are playing out as we expected. We're executing according to our plans and we're well-positioned for the balance of the year. Before I get into the business highlights for the quarter, let me give you a quick update on where we are with our pending acquisition of Life Technologies, which we announced in April. As I mentioned during our Analyst Meeting back in May, we appointed the integration leaders and the planning is now in full swing. The teams from both companies are working together well, and they're making great progress. As we move forward, we're really energized about the opportunities we see for the combined company. In terms of additional progress we've made to date, we secured a significant portion of our debt and equity financing, which we announced during the quarter, and Pete will give you more of those details. We're also making progress on the regulatory front, and we continue to expect that we'll complete the transaction early in 2014.", "Now I'll turn to some of the business highlights for Q2 using our 3 key growth drivers as a framework: they are technology innovation, our value proposition and presence in emerging markets. First, it was an exceptional quarter for innovation. As you know, we basically stole the show at the American society of Mass Spectrometry this year with the launch of 3 new mass spec platforms that have the potential to revolutionize the way our customers work. Customer applications are evolving all the time, getting more and more sophisticated as the knowledge base expands. That leads them to push the limits of their experiments and the performance of their instruments. This is probably most obvious in life sciences research, where our customers want to analyze increasingly complex biological samples. So we combined the best of the best of Thermo Scientific mass analyzers; our flagship, Orbitrap; our linear ion trap and our triple quad platforms and the result was an entirely new class of instrument that we launched at ASMS, the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid. With this extremely high-resolution system, customers can perform analysis that were previously not possible. For example, cell biologist can conduct experiments in parallel for faster and deeper analysis of proteomes and up to a twofold increase in low-level protein identification. The Orbitrap Fusion has the potential to dramatically change the way experiments are run and that can greatly accelerate the pace of life sciences research.", "We also redesigned our triple stage quadrupole systems to boost performance and ease-of-use. The Quantiva provides the absolutely lowest levels of detections for toxicology, food and environmental testing, while the Endura provides maximum up time and throughput in forensics, pharma QA/QC and other applied markets. Since many of our customers use both our hybrid and triple quad technologies in their labs, we also made it easier to integrate these platforms and manage all the data. In fact, we launched a suite of 10 new software packages at ASMS. All of these systems have been very well received by our customers.", "One last point on innovation. We're very pleased that Thermo Fisher was once again recognized by R&D Magazine on its list of the year's top 100 technologies, but this was the first time that we actually won 5 awards for our Thermo Scientific products. Our winners include TruNarc handheld drug analyzer, the iS50 and iCAP Q spectrometers, along with our Dionex ICS-4000 and the EASY-Spray accessory for our chromatography portfolio. It's clear to see that our commitment to innovation is creating value for our customers and contributing to our growth.", "Let me spend a few minutes on our value proposition, our second key growth driver, and give you some examples that highlight the clear advantages it gives us with our customers. I've already talked about mass spec in the context of innovation, but let me add here that one of the reasons we're so successful in building this franchise is that we've established deep relationships with our customers, and we've done that by partnering with them over the years to deliver a value proposition that only Thermo Fisher can provide. This is evident in the research and scientific community, which has contributed significantly to strengthening our position in mass spec, but it's also increasingly evident in Applied Markets, where our customers in food safety, for example, are turning to us first because of our unique depth of capabilities in chromatography. Another example is our Specialty Diagnostics business. A long-term customer, Roche, recently extended our partnership in the area of biomarkers. They renewed a new long-term contract with us to use our PCT assay for sepsis on their instrument systems outside the United States.", "Our widely recognized value proposition is very instrumental in helping us open the door to new potential opportunities as well. For example, during my trip to China during the quarter, I had the chance to meet with the party secretary of one of the key provinces and his staff. We discussed extensively how Thermo Fisher's mission is aligned with the primary societal issues in China. He was amazed of the value proposition I described and how we're able to address the country's most pressing needs in health care, the environment and food safety.", "That's a good segue to emerging markets, the third element of our growth strategy. In short, Asia-Pacific was very strong for us again this quarter. Our teams in China delivered outstanding growth, well above 20%, which is the 8th quarter in a row of 20% or more organic growth. Although our core industrial markets remained weak in the region, we're seeing very good growth in healthcare and Applied Markets. This is particularly benefiting our mass spec, chromatography and air quality product lines. To build on our capabilities in the region and support continued growth, we invested about $10 million to establish a new China Innovation and Technology Training Center in Shanghai, which we opened in Q2. The new center will significantly expand product engineering and development to meet the specific needs of our Asia-Pacific customers. The facility will also support the training of a couple thousands customers every year and the use of our analytical instruments and other technologies, a real differentiator that will help us fuel future organic growth. In other emerging markets, our business in Brazil benefited again this quarter from the government stimulus project. This continued our momentum in the country, which delivered double-digit growth again this quarter.", "Turning now to our guidance. We're updating both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year as you saw in our press release. Pete will get into the details, but at a high-level, we're updating our revenue range to reflect the increased headwinds we're experiencing from currency exchange rates, which are partially offset by our solid operating performance. We now expect to deliver between $12.83 billion and $12.95 billion in 2013. This will result in 3% to 4% growth for the year that we previously communicated. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.02. This primarily reflects our solid operating performance in the first 6 months of the year and some offset from currency exchange and a slightly higher share count. Our adjusted EPS growth remains at 7% to 9% over last year.", "So before I turn the call over to Pete, let me summarize the key takeaways for the quarter. Overall, our end markets played out as we expected and our solid execution led to good growth at the top and bottom line. We delivered a solid first half that puts us in an excellent position to achieve our growth goals for the year. We have a lot to look forward to as we continue to reap the benefits of our commitment to innovation, leveraging our value proposition and expanding in emerging markets. We now have the opportunity to build on these strengths through our pending acquisition of Life Technologies and are excited about the value this transaction will create for our customers and shareholders alike.", "Now I'll turn it over to Pete. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the total company, provide some color on each of our 3 segments, update you on our recent financing actions to fund the Life Technologies acquisition and then conclude with our guidance.", "As you saw in our press release, we delivered a solid quarter of top and bottom line results, resulting in an 8% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.32. GAAP EPS in Q2 was $0.76, up 21% from $0.63 in Q2 last year. Looking at the top line, Q2 total revenue increased 4% year-over-year and we delivered 2% organic growth. Q2 reported revenue includes 2% growth from acquisitions and a nominal negative impact from foreign exchange. Although the revenue impact of FX in the quarter was minimal, as a result of the mix of currencies, primarily weakening of the Japanese yen, the earnings impact was significant, resulting in about 50 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.04 or 3% of adjusted EPS dilution year-over-year.", "Bookings were slightly less than revenue in the quarter, but bookings grew organically in all 3 segments. By geography, North America declined in the low single digits. Europe grew in the mid-single digits, and consistent with previous quarters, Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits, with China once again delivering very strong growth of over 20%. Rest-of-world grew in the high single digits as well. Looking at our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income was up 6% and adjusted operating margin was 19.3%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. We continue to have very strong contribution from our productivity and cost actions, which was partially offset by foreign exchange as I mentioned previously. We initiated another $10 million of restructuring actions this quarter to help offset some of the FX headwind we're experiencing. This brings the total amount of restructuring benefit we expect to realize this year to $85 million when combined with the $75 million of benefit from restructuring actions that we initiated and communicated in previous quarters. In total, we realized about $24 million of benefit from these actions in Q2 and about $45 million in the first half of the year. We continue to make strategic investments to drive growth this quarter, primarily in emerging markets to strengthen our global presence and to continue our growth momentum there.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44.2% in Q2, down 50 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign exchange and the medical device tax, partially offset by contribution from acquisitions. As I mentioned, we delivered very strong productivity in the quarter, which was driven by our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 22% of revenue, down 60 basis points from the 2012 quarter as a result of volume leverage and our restructuring actions. And finally, R&D expense came in at 3% of revenue, essentially in line with the prior year. Below the line, net interest expense in Q2 was $57 million, $7 million above last year as a result of the debt we issued in Q3 2012 to fund the One Lambda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.6%, consistent with our previous guidance and 160 basis points lower than last year as a result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax planning efforts.", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $54 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. As we discussed on the Q1 call, we've suspended our buyback program in light of our pending acquisition of Life Technologies. So there were no share buybacks in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 363.5 million in Q2, down 5.7 million or 2% from last year, reflecting the benefit of our previous share buyback programs. However, our share count is up by 1.8 million shares from Q1, primarily as a result of option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Year-to-date cash flow from continuing operations was $778 million and free cash flow was $650 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $128 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was down from the prior year, primarily as a result of increased working capital investment. As expected, we also expended $58 million on fees associated with the financing of our pending acquisition of Life Technologies, which lowered free cash flow in the quarter. We anticipate that our working capital performance will improve in the second half of the year, although our full-year results will be negatively impacted by the financing fees, which were not included in our previous full year outlook for free cash flow. We ended the quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and investments, up $405 million sequentially from Q1, driven by our free cash flow. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $7.1 billion, essentially flat with Q1.", "Now let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our return on invested capital performance. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC through the second quarter of 2013 was 9.7%, up another 10 basis points from Q1 so we continue to make good progress on return on invested capital.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our 3 business segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies. In Q2, total revenue grew 4% and organic revenue also increased 4%. We saw a strong growth in our BioProcess Production business again this quarter, as well as in our chromatography and mass spec business, which benefited from strong performance in China. This was partially offset by the softness we continue to see in our core industrial markets, which are more highly represented in this segment. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 17.7%, up 30 basis points. During the quarter, we delivered very strong productivity, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q2, total revenue grew 8% and organic growth was 2%. We continued to deliver very good growth in our clinical diagnostics business, and Europe is starting to stabilize across the segment. However, we did see some softness in the segment due to lower healthcare utilization in the U.S., as Marc mentioned. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% in Q2, with adjusted operating margin at 27.3%, up 10 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of productivity savings, acquisitions and favorable mix. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange, strategic investments and the medical device tax.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, total revenue and organic growth -- organic revenue both grew 3%. Our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver strong growth and our laboratory consumables business had good growth as well. Muted conditions in the U.S. academic and government end market, as a result of sequestration, continue to be a significant headwind in this segment. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 3% and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%, up 10 basis points, driven by improved productivity, offset partially by strategic investments.", "Before I move on to 2013 guidance, I want to provide a brief update on our activities to finance the Life Technologies acquisition. As a reminder, we put in place a fully committed $12.5 billion bridge loan facility when we announced the transaction with the intent to reduce the amount of that facility as we secure more permanent forms of financing. To date, we have secured $7.5 billion of permanent financing, which consists of a $5 billion term loan facility, which allows for LIBOR-based borrowings, and we don't expect to drop on this facility until we're ready to close the acquisition. So there are currently no funds borrowed, and therefore, no related interest expense at this point, and $2.5 billion of equity via forward sales of Thermo Fisher common shares. As a forward transaction, no shares have been issued yet so there's no impact to our share count, except for a slight amount of treasury stock method dilution based on our shares trading above the forward price. We expect to issue the related shares just before we close the acquisition. With these 2 financing arrangements in place, we've reduced our bridge commitment by $7.5 billion and we'll reduce the bridge facility to 0 once we've secured the rest of the financing.", "At this point, we expect the remainder of the financing will consist of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in debt, which will most likely be in the form of bonds and up to $750 million of equity or equity-linked securities, the amount of which will be dependent on our available cash upon closing the transaction. We'll continue to update you as we finalize these financing arrangements. In terms of the average interest rate on new debt, although rates have gone up a bit, we still expect our average rate to be at or below our previously communicated average of 3.25% to 3.5%.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2013 guidance. Please note that as I mentioned on our Q1 call, our 2013 earnings guidance does not include the acquisition of Life Technologies or the impact of related financing activities. In terms of our reported revenue guidance, many foreign currencies, specifically in the Asia-Pacific region have weakened further since our previous guidance and we now expect an additional $50 million of revenue headwind from foreign exchange for the year. On the organic revenue front, we're raising the low end of our organic growth guidance by $40 million based on our year-to-date performance, which offsets a portion of the FX headwind. That results in a narrower guidance range, as well as a $20 million increase in the midpoint of our organic growth, but we're still expecting 2% organic growth for the year at the midpoint. The net result on reported revenue is that we're lowering the high-end of our guidance by $50 million for FX and the low end by only $10 million, which leads to our new range of $12.83 billion to $12.95 billion. This range represents reported growth of 3% to 4% over 2012, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. Completed acquisitions are expected to contribute about 1.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2013, no change from our previous guidance and we now expect foreign exchange to have a negative impact on our top line of about 3/4 of 1%, which as I mentioned, has deteriorated since our previous guidance. The bottom line impact from FX on our full year is even more significant and is now expected to result in 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.11 or 2% of adjusted EPS dilution year-over-year. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end and tightening our previous range by $0.02, in line with our new revenue range. This results in our new adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.29 to $5.39 or 7% to 9% growth over 2012. To bridge the midpoint, which is up $0.01 versus our previous guidance, we lost about $0.03 as a result of the FX headwinds and another $0.01 as a result of a slightly higher share count due to the equity forward accounting. This was more than offset by improved operating performance, which contributed about $0.04 and a slightly lower tax rate, which added another $0.01. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin. We're expecting expansion of 30 to 50 basis points, consistent with our previous guidance, and moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be consistent with our previous guidance. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be at about 14.5% at the low-end of our previous guidance, and we're assuming that we'll return a total of about $310 million of capital to shareholders, composed of $90 million in share buybacks that we completed in Q1 and about $220 million in dividends for the full year, unchanged from our previous guidance. Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 364 million to 366 million, about 1 million shares higher than our previous guidance, as a result of the equity forward accounting, as I mentioned earlier.", "Finally, we expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $315 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion, which was $100 million lower than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of financing fees and transaction cost associated with our pending acquisition of Life Technologies. In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges as I said in the past, you should focus on our midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year as well as the economic factors we've discussed.", "In summary, we once again managed through the macro environment, executed well and delivered good growth in revenue and adjusted EPS. With half the year behind us, I believe we're well-positioned to meet our full year goals. With that, I'll turn the call over to the operator for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Marc, I just wanted to focus a little on the government and academic because it sounds like, if I heard you correctly, overall, you saw some growth in the quarter, and I think it was down in the first quarter. So I just wanted to get a little bit more insight geographically kind of how you saw things change, and maybe in the U.S., how much of a headwind that's being on the LP&S (sic) [LPS] business right now. And in China, maybe how much it's growing, given the industrial business is down.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So Jon, essentially, the end markets, the conditions are the same, the academic and government. The nuance in the quarter was we had our first full quarter of sequestration, right? So you had it slightly weaker in the U.S. That was offset by a little bit of strength in the markets outside the U.S. so we reported slight growth, but I wouldn't read much of a trend or change from what we saw in previous quarters. In terms of where you see the headwind most, as you mentioned correctly, lab products and services are going to have the largest exposure to the U.S. academic and government proportion so that's where the headwind would be the most significant.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "And just to be clear, is that --- how much of a headwind is that right now to the life -- to the LPS business?", "Peter M. Wilver", "It's probably in the range of 1% to 2% for that segment.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on your comments on life, Marc, I'm guessing you're spending a lot of time getting to know the business quite a bit better, the products, end markets and customers. And I'm just curious, as you kind of you look through and think of the potential, the combined in proteomics and genomics, and what you both have in forensics and opportunities in bio production. I just -- I don't know, as dig into it, do you have any kind of further thoughts or some of your early discussions with customers about where you think there's some -- what's getting you even more excited, I think, was your comment on the call.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. Since our last update, which was at the Analyst Meeting, we have -- our integration teams are really in the full action mode at this point. So I've had an opportunity to interact with several thousand of our soon-to-be new colleagues at life technologies through Town Halls, and at the same point, really get to know the integration teams and their progress. We're excited, I mean, obviously about what the potential is in the future and the feedback we get from our customers. Obviously, we're still 2 separate companies, but the feedback we're getting kind of inbound calls has been very, very, very positive. And I think there's great opportunities in the life science research area over time when you think about the workflows that have an intersection between proteomics and genomics. I actually thought that at the Analyst Meeting, the microbiologists that we had talked, give you a good example of how their work has both genomics and proteomics and literally side by side in dealing with the challenges of infection in the healthcare system so I thought that was a good example that our collaborator in the U.K. highlighted that particular venue.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Just wanted to get a little more clarity on the Pharma customer base for you. It certainly continues to perform quite well, maybe just 2 questions there. Number one, anything notable, Marc and Pete, on kind of spending patterns in the quarter? You can hear some rumblings already this quarter about maybe some capital budget restraints as we end -- kind of get towards the end of the quarter. I'm just wondering in your high single digit growth kind of, any further clarity you can provide on the pacing and/or the dynamics underneath that.", "Marc N. Casper", "Pharma has been really strong for us. It's clear that we're continuing to gain share, which we have for a number of quarters. We've seen really good strength across the portfolio, obviously, highlighted by our clinical trials logistics business, where our value proposition is just -- is really is phenomenal in terms of the ability to have a very high quality offering that reduces our customers' costs, and we are benefiting from our BioProcess Production capabilities, which is coming from demand for vaccines and bio-therapeutics from around the world. In terms of the pattern for the quarter, no. In fact, the quarter ended fairly strong for us so we feel good about the pacing of the orders, and we thought that gave us confidence that when we thought about our guidance for the year that we have slightly raised the organic outlook on the low end as we post solid for 6 months behind us.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And then maybe one more customer question, Marc and Pete, just in terms of industrial. I know you said things kind of trended as you expected in the quarter, but since that business is the one that you've incorporated the biggest headwind within your full year guidance, just interested to hear kind of anything notable kind of within pacing or geographic on industrial just -- if it's spot in line or are there any kind of opportunity maybe to see some improvement in industrial as -- while China is weak and the rest of the world looks like we're gaining some traction.", "Marc N. Casper", "So Dan, in terms of industrial, in the industrial and applied markets, we were down low single digits, which was similar to last quarter. It was actually at the low-end of our expectations in terms of the end market. We have not seen the inflection point in the core industrials. So we continue to remain cautious on the outlook. And to give you a little bit more flavor or color, on the core industrial side, we had good strength in molecular spectroscopy, which is primarily a result of strong new products that we've launched over the last 18 months or so. But in certain parts of the industrial segments, driven primarily by commodity materials, pretty weak. Examples there would be portable instruments used for scrap metal sorting would be a weak end market right now. And then on the applied side, we continue to see pockets of strength, and that's helping offset some of the weakness in core industrial.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "You made a comment on the health care channel about a little bit of a slowdown there, and I guess, we -- going back to Q2 '09 when you had a bigger slowdown there, I'm just wondering if you can talk in your visibility. I don't think it's anything close to the de-stocking issues you had before, but can you talk about your visibility in the healthcare channel and maybe just elaborate on the comments you made?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So Tyco, for the quarter, in aggregate, the conditions were incredibly similar to Q1, right? So the performance was almost identical, but we did provide a little more color because as we look at the broad healthcare industry, there's clearly, in the U.S., some headwinds that aren't particularly significant, but there's a little bit of a headwind on utilization, and we saw that nicely offset by some strength in Europe, really, Europe is stabilizing for us and continued momentum in emerging markets. So we provided a little bit more color, but the results in terms of organic growth in that customer set was pretty much identical between Q1 and Q2.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the new mass spec systems, can you help us just think about the sizing and the market opportunity for the Orbitrap, the new fusion and the 2 triple quads? And these things always take a couple of quarters to gain traction, but when do you think those start to actually have some impact on revenues?", "Marc N. Casper", "So the triple quad market is one of the largest, if not, the largest market in mass spectrometry. We're one of 4 participants in that market that have been in that market forever, and we're the company now with the new systems, right? So we have 2 new systems launched, and that will allow for both the replacement cycle for our current customers and a share gain opportunity for taking share from other competitors. On the Orbitrap Tribrid product, the Fusion, we're very excited. Actually, the feedback from our collaborators have been incredibly positive, and it's a little early to call how big it will be, but I would say that when I thought about the enthusiasm I have for the Q Exactive a couple of years ago and said that was going to be a whole new category of instruments, that was clearly the case and I would say my early read on the feedback is that this could be very significant in 2014. We clearly -- we're already starting to ship the product so it's not as if it's all in the future, but I think this can be a really significant growth driver 6 months out from now with some nice momentum in the short term.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And last quick one on life, have you guys filed in China at this point for anti-trust? And then secondly, as we think about the integration, how easy are things like PPI to transfer over to their business and how easy is it with the life products in your catalog? Can you just talk about some of those metrics as well?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so the integration team, so I'd do that one first, then we'll go to regulatory. So from an integration team perspective, in terms of getting the right products on the right e-commerce platform and then the right training, the right commercial teams for that, that stuff is all being thought through, and that will get metered out over the first year or 2. If you look at how we phased our synergies, revenue synergies typically really start to roll in, in year 2 and 3. Cost synergies start on day 1. So there's a little bit of time, and obviously, we try to shorten that window as much as we can, but we feel very confident with our ability to not only successfully integrate the business, but drive good growth out of it. In terms of the regulatory process, we are continuing to go through that process. It's going according to our expectations. We're still anticipating exactly as we have before that we're going to close early in 2014 and we don't really comment on the specific filings and the nuances of where we are with those things, but it's going according to the plans we've laid out.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "On Europe, we got some decent PMI data today. I know most of the weakness you've seen has been more so focused on the Specialty Diagnostics business for Phadia. I mean, as we think about sort of the general trajectory there in the region, if we do get sort of a modest recovery, or at least, a modest return to growth overall, what's the correlation between that and some of those businesses that have struggled and maybe have been more reimbursement or utilization related? And what are you sort of assuming for that in the back half of the year in terms of growth?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when we looked at the quarter, our Specialty Diagnostics business, which has a significant exposure to Europe primarily because of our immuno diagnostics business, which as you mentioned, we definitely saw a stabilization there. So we -- and the question is, is it one quarter or is it the beginning of a trend? And that's hard to tell, but we're watching it closely and we were happy with the stabilization that we saw. Now in terms of what we're assuming in our outlook for the full year, we really haven't changed the geographic outlook particularly significantly. We thought about it more from an end market perspective as we look at the remainder of the year, Ross.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe just on China, you guys have done a tremendous job there. There's been a lot of noise. I mean, you kind of talked about it. One of the prior questions in terms of some of the commodity-related businesses, industrial-related businesses being softer, but as you think about sort of the go-forward, I mean, today, there was a big piece about them continuing to do hospital reform. It seems like healthcare and the multinationals are investing. I mean, as you try to put all the pieces together of your performance versus sort of the perception of what's going on in that market, where do you feel like the biggest disconnect is to where you're kind of insulated from maybe some of the concerns that people have had?", "Marc N. Casper", "So when you look at our business in China, we're using our scale to our advantage, right? We have manufacturing. We have an R&D center. We have multiple training centers. We have a business headquartered there. We're closing in quickly on 3,000 colleagues. We recruit from the best universities. We are clearly very well-positioned in the market, and that's helping us drive significant growth, having quite a number of quarters of 20%-plus growth and this being one of our stronger quarters that we've had. When I look at why, so that's sort of our strategy, but we're very well aligned with the societal needs and the 5-year plan, right, which is around environmental protection, food safety and expanding health care capabilities, particularly in the west. And while I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to get multiple hours with an entire government for 100 million people in a province to really talk about our capabilities and their challenges and what the opportunities are for alignment, gives you a sense of the importance, even though they brought up in the dialogue that, yes, the industrial economy in their own province is a little bit weaker, right, and that has an effect on their GDP growth, but nonetheless, they thought it's important enough to actually talk through what we could do and collaborate together to really meet their needs on their own priorities as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "I just sort of want to follow-up on Tyco's question on Specialty Diagnostics. I mean you -- basically, over the last couple of quarters, you've seen organic revenue growth go from 6% in Q4, 4% last quarter, 2% this quarter. I'm just wondering how we should think about that business on a go-forward basis. And just given that, particularly, since the next couple of quarters, the comps actually get tougher on that from an organic basis. Can you just help us think about what's going on the overall dynamics of that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think it's always most helpful to think about what the long-term trends are for that business as opposed to the next 2 quarters. And my view is in the long-term, given the portfolio and the societal needs for our products, that's a solid mid-single-digit growth business for us, and we feel good about that in the midterm outlook. In terms of the comparison, yes, you're right, we have tougher comparisons, and I would say that we're not expecting significant changes in the organic growth in the second half of the year in Specialty Diagnostics, nothing particularly meaningful.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great, and then just one quick follow up on this. It's like so what do you see in terms of your plans for Specialty Diagnostics business once you have the Life Technologies capabilities there? I mean, what sort of -- I mean, how much do you intend to expand this business? What are sort of some of the augments you can do with the life portfolio?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so I think -- let me talk through it from a couple of perspectives. Let me step back one level, which is our priority post-close is to successfully integrate Life Technologies, maximize the value for our customers and deliver on the expectations for our shareholders. So when we think about our priorities, it's going to be around organic growth, and we do see really great capabilities of leveraging the infrastructure that we have in Specialty Diagnostics to continue the theme that we've had for many, many years, which is taking life sciences tools and moving them into clinical applications and I think that when you look at the portfolio of Life Technologies and you look at next-gen sequencing and you look at QPCR, you think about our own mass spectrometry, there are a number of great technologies that can be moved into the clinic and some are already happening, and I think you'll see us continue to leverage those capabilities to drive growth over time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I have, I guess, a couple of questions on the separation analysis market. So let me just run through those, and I'll get back into the queue. So early data from a couple of your competitors in mass spec suggests the market's growing at mid-single-digit to high-single-digit levels. Would you agree with that and what are you seeing at different product classes and end markets? And then on the liquid chromatography front, are there any changes in competitive dynamics or notable changes in demand patterns, either on the QA/QC or non-QA/QC front? And are you confidently gaining share via Dionex and if so, should we view this as an example of how you can gain share via both growing breadth and innovation in line with the 2 -- I guess, 2 of 3 components of your value proposition?", "Marc N. Casper", "That's very well said, Doug. I have to go back to the transcript and put that on my script next time. Let's do the second half first, which is about chrome and the value proposition. We had a very strong quarter in our chromatography business. HPLC did very well, and while all of the competitors haven't reported yet, at least, from the early read, it looks like we gained share again. So that's a good thing, and I think customers respect our technology, the great people that we have and the fact that we have incredible commercial reach, all right? I mean, we just have a huge scale sort of capabilities and our customers are very collaborative, right, so the great momentum in chromatography and food safety as an example, and that's a good area to highlight. So we feel good about the momentum in HPLC. In terms of the market growth, on mass spectrometry, I mean, it's somewhere in the mid to high single digits. I think that seems like a reasonable assumption. We feel good about our performance. We're particularly excited about the new products that we launched, and feel like that positions us for continued momentum going out into the balance of this year and into 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Pete, could you parse out the puts and takes around the gross margin experience in the quarter between mix, currency, acquisitions and productivity? I'm assuming the medical device tax was still around, I don't know, 15 basis points of headwind, but what exactly changes in the second half to get you towards the operating margin expansion goal for the year?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, so I'll do it at the EBITDA margin expansion level rather than gross margins just because the numbers are more relevant probably to our full-year guidance of 30 to 50 basis points. In the quarter, we had, as I said, 50 basis points of FX dilution. We actually had over 200 basis points of productivity, which is consistent with what we've had in the past and even net of inflation, we were still over 100 basis points. We spent about 80 basis points on investments, which I said in my comments, is really around emerging markets, and then we got 50 basis points of benefit from acquisitions, which is really around our One Lambda acquisition, which really performed very well in the quarter. That's what nets down to the 30 basis points. For the full year, the numbers aren't dramatically different than that other than, obviously, FX. The acquisition will be only for basically 3 quarters of the year. FX is around 30 basis points for the full year and then the productivity and investments, I would assume, is about the same numbers in the full year bridge.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "That's helpful. And then Marc, I realize Japan's a relatively small market for you, but could you speak to how that market performed, and in particular, did you see any impact from any stimulus-related orders yet?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So in terms of Japan, you're right. It's not a huge market for us, but given our scale, we actually have a large organization there. It grew in line with the company a little better than the company average. I would say that we have seen some meaningful orders on the stimulus, and those should translate into revenue in the second half of the year, which is clearly a good thing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Arias of UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Pete, any change on the yen assumption for the year relative to last quarter?", "Peter M. Wilver", "It's deteriorated a little bit. We're now using an assumption of 100.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe, Marc, to follow-up on the China question, as we get these sort of up-and-down macro data points and kind of go back and forth on whether we're doing better or worse. Are you finding that ordering patterns at all move with the macro sentiment intra-quarter, or for the most part, is spending fairly smooth? I mean, clearly, the growth speaks for itself there, but I'm trying to get a sense of whether you do see any fluctuation maybe month-to-month?", "Marc N. Casper", "We've had incredibly stable business in aggregate in China for the last few years, right. So we haven't noticed particularly big patterns in the quarter. So we had a very strong quarter, well over 20% growth. I was in the quarter in -- I was in China in late May, early June, and the business was doing -- was kind of about that rate then and it obviously finished then. So we saw a nice stability in terms of the strong momentum. So we clearly read the headlines that we see about -- there is ups and downs, but at least in the end markets that we're serving in aggregate, they continue to be strong and quite stable.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I just want to ask a little bit about market share trends and specifically, with regards to trends in LPS, I think earlier, in your comments, you did mention that you saw some broad market share gains in the business, and that's been in the last few quarters, of course. And if you look at the sales funnel, going forward, do you think it's possible that you could see continuation or acceleration in those share gains? Or is it fair to say that over the last 12 or 18 months, you've been unusually strong on the market share front?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. My view is that we like our prospects, and we feel like our value proposition's such that it will continue to deliver good organic growth for us going forward. So we're not assuming big changes in the end markets. We're not assuming big changes in our performance, meaning that the share gain momentum we have, we expect it to continue, right? And as obviously when we think about our guidance range, stronger end markets mean we'll raise our aspirations and weaker end markets means we'll come in more in the lower end of things so that we try to drive that same steady share gain momentum, and the variable change is just what are the market conditions.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Sure. And then just one follow-up, sort of a big picture question, if you look broadly at your portfolio, can you maybe comment as to what percentage of your products and services are purchased via maybe a centralized procurement method and maybe what percentage are purchased by the individual user? And the reason I ask is I'm trying to just assess kind of how that modality will change post life.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so in terms of -- it's a very tricky question because it's always collaborative, right. There are some customers that the end user just buys it with very little business insight, and there are others that business has a heavier weighing, but people don't buy things without the end-user involved. I would say my best estimate of the customer base that is more heavily business-oriented is very much in the biopharma area. It's going to be your biggest area. So that represents 25% of our revenue and a meaningful proportion, the business community plays a significant role. And when you look at the mix, it doesn't change all that much when you combine the company in terms of the exposure.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Pete, a question for you on some of the cost actions. You've added some incremental cost actions in each of the first 2 quarters. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the remainder of the year, and any incremental cost savings you're assuming to put in place in 3 and 4Q?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, so the $10 million that we put in place this year -- or excuse me, this quarter, brings the total for the year to $85 million. So those are actions that we didn't actually shut down the factories in this quarter or do the restructuring actions there. They will actually be executed in Q3 and Q4. So that's when we'll realize the benefits. We're expecting $85 million for the full year. We've realized $45 million through the first half, so that would say we're going to get around $20 million a quarter for the rest of the year.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "I guess, anything you're seeing that would make you put additional cost savings in place? That's the [indiscernible].", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, certainly, we've continued to put cost actions in place and primarily because of the FX headwind. So we're trying to offset the negative impact of the FX headwinds. So at this point, we're not expecting that to deteriorate further. If our markets deteriorated further and/or FX deteriorated further, then we would potentially put more actions in place, but at this point, we don't have any plans to do that.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay, great, and just on pricing, any comments you can give just on the global environment for pricing, and if there's anything notable within diagnostics?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So it's very similar to this quarter to what it's been in previous quarters. The split in pricing between consumables and equipment, it's stronger on consumables and relatively weak on equipment, somewhere between 0% and 0.5% net for the total company. Specifically, in diagnostics, it's probably around that same range. I mean, obviously, that's the consumables business for the most part so we do get some price in that business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "I just wonder if you could provide a little bit more color regarding your business in China. And just maybe remind us, what it looks like in China compared to your overall business in light of some of your comments regarding the LC and mass spec, seeing some strength there, and also in light of maybe some industrial slowdown going on in China these days.", "Marc N. Casper", "So when you think about the end markets in China, the LC and mass spec, clearly used very heavily in food safety, used in the academic settings for life sciences research, which are the big drivers and the other big business we obviously have there is environmental, which the minute you get off the airplane, in China, you realize that the environmental opportunity is huge, which is why the business is actually headquartered in China. Healthcare is a strong growing market for us as well. Industrial has been weak now for quite some time, as infrastructure build hasn't been particularly strong. So those businesses have felt the softening, but we've been able to power through that softening, actually deliver very consistent, strong, 20% or better organic growth now for the last couple of years.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Is the mix in your business in China, is it any different than the overall company really?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I mean, the answer is yes. There's going to be less exposure in aggregate lab products and services and Specialty Diagnostics, more exposure to the Analytical Technologies portion.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "When you look at the clinical trials logistics business, where do you think we're at in terms of the overall shift towards outsourcing? And what do think the long-term growth prospects are for that business?", "Marc N. Casper", "We feel good about the prospects for our clinical trials logistics business. In fact, we delivered very strong growth now consistently for quite a few quarters, and feel like there's still a huge amount of in-house activity that goes on in biopharma that allows us to continue to drive significant growth. So we feel like that business is well positioned for quite some time ahead, and it's been traditionally growing somewhere between the mid and high single digits on a fairly consistent basis.", "So let me just make a couple of quick closing comments. First of all, I want to just note that I am pleased with our solid first half performance. We remain confident that we'll continue our momentum to achieve our goals for the year. And we, of course, look forward to updating you on our progress in the Q3 call, and finally, thank you for the continued support of Thermo Fisher Scientific.

Casper", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our third quarter earnings call. I'm pleased to report that we executed well to deliver strong bottom line performance again this quarter, continuing the excellent growth momentum we've had all year. In a challenging market environment, we delivered 2% organic growth, which keeps us on track to achieve our full year guidance. Our bottom line results are a testament to our operational discipline and our ability to deliver strong earnings growth. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, I'm confident that we'll achieve the growth goals we laid out for 2013.", "With that, let's move into the highlights from the quarter, starting with the financials. Our revenue and adjusted EPS were both third quarter records. Reported revenue grew 3%, and adjusted EPS rose 9%.", "Turning to operating income. Our adjusted operating income grew 8%, and adjusted operating margin was a particular bright spot, with 70 basis points of expansion. Pete will go through the details behind our strong operating performance in the quarter, but as you know, we're always driving productivity across our businesses. We use our PPI Business System to improve our processes, so we can deliver the best products and services to our customers as efficiently as possible. This strengthens our competitive position and strengthens our bottom line.", "Let me take a moment now to talk about our performance with the current market environment as the backdrop. At a macro level, we've generally seen a continuation of the market conditions we've experienced all year. I'll give you some color on the performance by our 4 key end markets. Starting with academic and government, because it's probably top of mind, this end market was somewhat softer in Q3, given the environment in the U.S. As a result we were down here in the low single digits. Our customers continue to feel the effects of sequestration, along with the added uncertainty leading up to the budget standoff late in the quarter. Of course, the deal reached last week ensures that sequestration will be with us for the balance of the year. That said, we benefited from certain academic and government markets outside the U.S. The best example was a significant order for analytical instruments that we shipped to the Japanese National Police Agency for use in forensic toxicology and drugs-of-abuse screening. This was a result of a relationship we've built with this agency since we first supplied them with mass spectrometers back in 2008.", "Turning to industrial and applied markets. They pretty much played out as we expected, and we reported low single-digit growth here against an easy comp in Q3 last year. Getting into the details, core industrial markets remained weak overall, as they have been through the first half of the year. Our businesses serving these customers continue to face a challenging environment, and we still have an inflection point -- we still haven't seen an inflection point. However, we continue to see strength in some applied markets, particularly in China, which was an offset to the core industrial softness.", "Turning to health care and diagnostics, we didn't see any significant change here during the quarter, and our growth remained in the low single digits in Q3. We saw a carryover of the softness we experienced in Q2 as a result of lower healthcare utilization in the U.S., and our anatomical pathology business continues to be affected by lower U.S. reimbursement rates. The bright spot here was the performance of our transplant diagnostics business, formerly One Lambda. Although it wasn't included in our organic growth until mid-September, it's just over a year now since we acquired the business, which provides antibody and molecular tests to improve outcomes for transplant patients. And it's been a very nice addition to our Specialty Diagnostics portfolio. In the first year of ownership, transplant diagnostics delivered high single-digit revenue growth.", "Finally, in our pharma and biotech end markets, we continue to perform very well, growing in the high single digits. Our ongoing momentum here is a clear sign that our value proposition is resonating with these customers, and we're continuing to gain share.", "So to sum it all up, the overall market environment has been consistent with what we've seen all year long. We continue to look at this as an opportunity to leverage our scale and unique depth of capabilities to help our customers manage through and achieve their own success.", "Before I move on to our growth drivers and the business highlights for the quarter, let me give you a quick update on our pending acquisition of Life Technologies. First, as you probably know, Life Technologies shareholders voted to approve the transaction in late August. In addition to that important milestone, the integration planning teams are right on schedule, and day 1 planning is nearly complete. We continue to work through the regulatory process, and Pete will give you an update on our financing activities. Now that we're getting into the more detailed planning, we continue to feel very good about the synergy targets we originally laid out. The teams from both companies are excited about the value this combination will create for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. And as we stated when we first announced the transaction, we continue to expect an early 2014 close.", "Now I'll turn to some of the business highlights for the quarter in line with the elements of our growth strategy, specifically around technology innovation and our presence in emerging markets. It's been a terrific year for us in terms of innovation, and you know about our major Thermo Scientific product launches in the first half of the year at both Pittcon and the American Society of Mass Spectrometry.", "Before I cover our Q3 highlights, let me take a moment to remind you of the profound impact our new products are having on our customers. You'll recall that we launched 3 new mass spectrometry platforms at ASMS: the Orbitrap Fusion Trifid for life sciences applications; and the Endura and Quantiva triple quads, which are geared more towards customers in applied markets. We've had great customer uptake of these products, and we began shipping all 3 in the quarter.", "Let me relate a brief anecdote shared by one of our early adopters of the Fusion system, Dr. Josh Coon from the University of Wisconsin. In proteomic research, yeast has served as a common test organism for many years. In the past, it had taken about 4 hours to analyze a single yeast proteome. But with the Fusion Trifid, Dr. Coon and his team were able to perform a complete analysis in 1 hour. Dr. Coon described the Fusion's blazing spectral acquisition speed as truly unprecedented. He said that the fourfold reduction in analysis time will transform the speed and number of proteomes that can be analyzed, opening up new avenues of research. Dr. Coon also predicts that the comprehensive analysis of the human proteome in just a few hours is within reach using this exciting new platform. I think this tells you why we label some of these new technologies as groundbreaking and why we've been investing to keep our innovation pipeline strong.", "While we like to talk about mass spec innovation because of our leadership position, I want to emphasize that we innovate across our technology platforms. In Q3, we launched a number of new Thermo Scientific products, as we do just about every quarter. At the American Association of Clinical Chemistry, we announced 2 of our products received FDA 510 clearance: one was our Tacrolimus immunoassay used in organ transplant monitoring; and other was our MAS Omni\u00b7CARDIO control, which improves cardiac testing.", "At the BioProcess International Conference held last month, Thermo Fisher showcased new innovations that, for the first time, combined our bioscience and analytical instrument technologies for bioprocess applications. We introduced several technologies that meet increasing customer demand for the development and production of biologics. Now I'll just mention one of them. We launched our first bench-top process mass spec for biologics research, the Prima BT gas analyzer. Customers can now analyze complex gases that are a byproduct of the cell culture process, so they can better understand cell growth and more quickly scale up production.", "Last, I want to highlight a new product in one of our portable instrument offerings. At our Analyst Meeting last May, we talked about our microPHAZIR AG analyzer, which is used for testing in animal feed, which at the time was still in development. We launched the product in Q3, opening a completely new market by helping feed manufacturers do on-site inspection to improve quality and reduce production costs.", "I think my recap makes it clear that we have a strong innovation pipeline, and we've launched significant products across our businesses all year long.", "Turning to Asia Pacific and emerging markets, our growing presence in these regions is creating value for our customers, and our teams there delivered another great quarter. We continued our excellent growth momentum in China, with 20% revenue growth in Q3. I recently returned from a trip to China in September, and our teams are doing a great job leveraging our unique scale and depth of capabilities to gain market share. The opportunities in China are perfectly aligned with our mission to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer. And let me give you a couple of examples. We won a significant order to supply laboratory equipment to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Only locally manufactured products were continued for this project or considered for this project, and our new Suzhou manufacturing center was a key factor in this customer win. In air quality monitoring, we continue to see a steady source of growth for us. You may recall that we moved the headquarters of this business to China a few years back, and it's really helped us to gain greater access to this important growth market. We expanded our presence in Asia Pacific during the quarter as well by opening a new production facility in Singapore to support increasing global demand for vaccines, therapeutic drugs and other biologics. This added capacity will help ensure a safe and uninterrupted supply of materials for our biopharma customers and will also serve as a logistics hub for the efficient delivery of these critical supplies.", "Turning to Brazil, we continued our strong momentum here as well, growing better than 20% in Q3. We strengthened our commercial presence in Brazil to support the country's rapid growth.", "Turning now to our guidance. As you saw in our press release, with 3 strong quarters behind us, we're raising the low end of both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. Pete will cover the details, but at a high level, we're bringing up the low end of our revenue guidance by $40 million and now expect to deliver between $12.87 billion and $12.95 billion in 2013. This will result in 3% to 4% growth for the year. We're also raising the low end of our adjusted EPS by $0.02 in this -- $0.02 this quarter for growth of 7% to 9% over last year.", "So before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with the key points of the quarter. First, we executed well to deliver another strong quarter of adjusted EPS growth. Our scale and depth of capabilities are a key competitive advantage, and we continue to build on our leadership positions. The integration planning for Life Technologies is progressing well, and we look forward to the value this transaction will create.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Pete.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As I've done in the past, I'll start with an overview of our financial performance for the total company, provide some color on each of our 3 segments, briefly review the status of our financing activities related to the Life Technologies acquisition, and then conclude with some color on our updated 2013 guidance.", "As you saw in our press release and heard from Marc, we delivered a solid quarter, resulting in a 9% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.30. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.86, also up 9% from $0.79 in Q3 last year. Looking at the top line, Q3 total revenue increased 3% year-over-year, and we delivered 2% organic growth. Q3 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions and a nominal negative impact from foreign exchange. Although the revenue impact of FX in the quarter was minimal, similar to the past few quarters, the mix of currencies, including the weakening of the Japanese yen, drove a significant negative impact on earnings. This resulted in about 40 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.03 or 2% of adjusted EPS dilution year-over-year in the quarter.", "In terms of orders, we've returned to growth in our backlog, with bookings slightly exceeding revenue in the quarter.", "By geography, North America declined slightly. Europe grew in the low single digits. And consistent with previous quarters, Asia Pacific grew in the high single digits, with China once again delivering very strong growth of 20%. Rest of world grew over 20%, primarily driven by Latin America.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income was up 8%, and we delivered very strong adjusted operating margin of 19.4%, up 70 basis points from the prior year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by very strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI Business System, and we also benefited from acquisition accretion. These gains were partially offset by growth investments and foreign exchange. The $85 million benefit from restructuring actions that we previously communicated for this year continues to provide some offset to the FX headwind. And in total, we realized about $20 million of benefit from these restructuring actions in Q3 and about $65 million year-to-date. In terms of driving growth, we continue to make strategic investments, primarily in emerging markets, to strengthen our global presence and to continue our strong growth momentum there.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44% in Q3, flat to the prior year, with accretion from acquisitions being offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 21.6% of revenue, down 70 basis points from the 2012 quarter as a result of volume leverage and the previously mentioned productivity actions. Finally, R&D expense came in at 3% of revenue, essentially flat with the prior year.", "Below the line, net interest expense in Q3 was $57 million, $3 million above last year, as a result of the debt we issued in mid-Q3 2012 to fund the One Lambda acquisition. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.3%, consistent with our previous guidance and 160 basis points lower than last year, as a result of acquisition tax synergies and our ongoing tax planning efforts.", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $54 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. And as discussed on previous calls, we've suspended our share buyback program in light of our pending acquisition of Life Technologies, so there were no share buybacks in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 367.3 million in Q3, up 1.9 million or 1% from last year, reflecting the accounting impact of the equity forward we entered into in the second quarter. Our share count increased by 3.8 million shares from Q2, primarily as a result of the equity forward accounting and option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first 9 months of the year was $1.29 billion, and free cash flow was $1.11 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $170 million. Year-to-date free cash flow was down slightly from the prior year, primarily as a result of increased working capital investment, along with financing fees and transaction costs related to Life Technologies. We ended the quarter with $1.85 billion in cash and investments, up $480 million sequentially from Q2, driven by our strong free cash flow. This build in our cash balance is tracking in line with our expectations related to the Life Technologies financing. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $7.11 billion, essentially flat with Q2.", "So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our return on invested capital performance. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC through the third quarter of 2013 was 9.8%, up 10 basis points from Q2, so we continue to make good progress on this important metric.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our 3 business segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies, in Q3 total revenue grew 1%, and organic revenue also increased 1%. We had strong growth in our mass spec business again this quarter, and we're seeing great traction from the mass specs we launched at ASMS in June. And we continue to benefit from great performance in China. We also saw good growth in instrumentation for the applied markets. This growth was partially offset by the softness we continue to see in our core industrial markets, which are most highly represented in this segment, as well as in some U.S. government-funded projects. Adjusted operating income in Analytical Technologies decreased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 18.1%, down 80 basis points. During the quarter, we were negatively impacted by foreign exchange, product mix and strategic investments, which were partially offset by continued strong productivity.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q3 total revenue grew 7%, and organic growth was 1%. In the quarter, we delivered good growth in our clinical diagnostics business, specifically in biomarkers. And although it didn't impact our organic growth for the segment until late in the quarter, we saw a very nice growth in our transplant diagnostics business, which has consistently been performing above expectations. However, as Marc mentioned, we continue to see some softness in this segment relating to healthcare utilization and reimbursement pressure. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 20% in Q3, with adjusted operating margin at 26.8%. This was up 270 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of productivity savings, acquisition accretion and favorable mix.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment, both reported and organic revenue grew 4%. Our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver strong growth, and our channel business had good growth as well. Weakened conditions in the U.S. academic and government end market, as a result of sequestration and the uncertainties surrounding the government shutdown, continued to be a headwind in this segment. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 7%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.9%, up 50 basis points, driven by strong productivity.", "Before I move on to 2013 guidance, I want to provide you with a brief update on the status of the Life Technologies financing. As I mentioned on our Q2 call, we secured $7.5 billion of permanent financing, consisting of a $5 billion term loan facility and $2.5 billion from a forward sale of equity, both of which we plan to draw down closer to the close. For the remainder of the financing, there's no material change from what I reported on our Q2 call. We still expect that the remainder of the financing, in addition to cash on hand, will consist of $3.5 billion to $4 billion in debt, which will likely be in the form of bonds, and up to $750 million of equity or equity-linked securities. We'll continue to update you as we finalize these arrangements. And in terms of the average interest rate on the new debt, we still expect to meet our previously communicated range of 3.25% to 3.5%.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our updated 2013 guidance. Please note that, as I mentioned on our earlier calls, our 2013 earnings guidance does not include the acquisition of Life Technologies or the impact of the related transaction and financing costs. As you saw in our press release, we're raising the low end of our reported revenue guidance by $40 million, reflecting our solid performance for the first 3 quarters of the year. This results in a revised revenue guidance range of $12.87 billion to $12.95 billion, which represents reported growth of 3% to 4% compared to our 2012 revenues of $12.51 billion, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of organic revenue growth, we're expecting to be in the range of 2% to 2.5% for the full year. Completed acquisitions are expected to contribute about 1.5% to our reported revenue growth, no change from our previous guidance. And we now expect foreign exchange to have a negative impact on our top line of about 60 basis points, which has improved slightly since our previous guidance. The bottom line impact from FX on our full year continues to be significant and is expected to result in 30 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.11 or 2% of adjusted EPS dilution year-over-year. In terms of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.02, reflecting our solid operating performance in the first 9 months of the year and consistent with the increase in our revenue range. This results in our new adjusted EPS guidance range of $5.31 to $5.39 or 7% to 9% growth over 2012, up $0.01 at the midpoint versus our previous guidance. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates, and our guidance doesn't include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin. We're raising the low end of our range by 10 basis points and now expect expansion of 40 to 50 basis points. Moving below the line, there are no changes from our previous guidance for net interest expense, tax rate, capital expenditures, free cash flow or return of capital. We're still expecting net interest expense to be up $15 million versus last year and that our adjusted income tax rate will be about 14.5%. We expect capital expenditures to be in the range of $300 million to $315 million and free cash flow to be in the range of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion.", "And we're still assuming that we'll return a total of about $310 million of capital to shareholders, composed of the $90 million in share buybacks that we completed in Q1 and about $220 million of dividends for the full year.", "Finally, full year average diluted shares are now estimated to be in the range of 365 million to 366 million shares, up 1 million shares at the low end from our previous guidance, as a result of option and equity forward dilution related to our higher stock price.", "In interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as I've said in the past, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint would depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year, as well as the economic factors we've discussed.", "So in summary, we once again managed through the macro environment, executed well and delivered strong adjusted EPS. With 3 quarters of the year behind us, I believe that we're well positioned to meet our full year goals.", "With that, I'll turn the call back to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Okay, thanks, Pete. Shannon, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So maybe, Marc, just digging in a little bit on the markets, particularly on the Analytical Tech business, how would you sort of characterize the pacing of orders or pacing of revenues in the quarter in some of the more short-cycle businesses? And in some of the areas where you had weakness, did things get incrementally better at any point, did they stay relatively stable? I'm just trying to get a sense for the jump-off point relative to sort of what we've seen in the macro, which is maybe a modest improvement in some of the subsectors.", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so -- Ross, thank you for the question. Let me focus just on the Analytical Technologies, which is where you focused the question. So within that, we have our largest exposure to core industrial businesses -- or markets, and for us, that's most dependent on things like commodity materials. We didn't see any change to the quarter in terms of patterns, so it continues to be a soft market. It's been soft all year. So that's the kind of the industrial portion of that business. When you look at within that same segment, we also have our mass spectrometry and chromatography businesses, and our mass spectrometry business had an outstanding quarter, and our liquid chromatography business was very, very strong as well. So there's a lot of details within that portfolio, but we didn't see a lot of change month-to-month. There was more industrials very soft, but areas that you would expect Thermo Fisher to continue to gain share, things like life science, mass spec and HPLC, that continues to be consistent.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And maybe just from a competitive perspective, it's always tough to tease out relative growth rates amongst the peers just because the businesses differ so much. What I found interesting on my last Asia trip was a lot of your competitors were saying how harder -- how much harder it is to compete against Thermo today than 12 months, 24, 36 months ago. Where do you feel like you're seeing the most success of sort of the integrated strategy? Where is the channel having the most impact? I'm just curious, across the business, it seems like that momentum has increased. Where do you feel like we're actually seeing it in the numbers, although, obviously, it's tough to tease out in the totals?", "Marc N. Casper", "All right. So China's been growing consistently in that 20% range for us now for quite a number of quarters. We have a very integrated strategy, right? So because of our scale, we believe that we're able to put the best people on board, which allows us to execute, in a way, a harder strategy, but that strategy has manufacturing facilities that are geared towards the local market. I mean, that's why I picked out the Chinese CDC, right, which is, in this particular order, they wanted just local manufactured products, right, and the reality is we were able to do that, right, big order. Our customers want some degree of tailoring of our global products to meet their specific needs, which is why our China technology center exists. Environmentally, you get off the airplane in China, you know that there's air quality issues, right? You don't literally have to even -- you can see it when you're landing, right, which is why our business is globally headquartered there for air monitoring. So when you look at it, we have broad breadth -- broad-range strength in the market, and we're using our scale to create a really positive customer experience. Our executive team spends an enormous amount of time in China. I was there in September. I'm going back next week. The rest of the -- the rest of my direct reports do the same thing because the government is very important to decision-making, and building those strong relationships is an advantage, and scale matters. Little companies just don't have the same access as an industry leader has, and we're trying to take that to the next level every time.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Congratulations on another really remarkable quarter from an adjusted EPS and margin standpoint. And, Marc, I just want to focus on that for a second. So if I look back over the last -- just looking at this year more on an annual basis -- I know we're only 3 quarters through, but if you look back kind of to 2011, 2012, 2013, you're kind of in that 2.5% to 3.5% organic growth. But if I look at this year, you're doing 40 bps, 40 to 50 bps of operating margin expansion, that's not including the medical device tax, which probably gives you another 20 bps, the unfavorable FX that Pete mentioned. So I'm just curious, if that's kind of the realm of growth that we're in, say, over the next year or 2, you're still in that 2.5% to 3.5%, is that still -- is that still feasible, what you're doing there? Do you feel like you're really starving the organization some? And I mean, I'm just trying to think about kind of the levers that you feel like you still have to pull as if the macro doesn't really improve that much.", "Marc N. Casper", "Jon, it's a great question right? So we have a very strong operating system at the company, our PPI Business System. And our 39,000 colleagues are constantly trying to make the company better every day and more efficient. And as we went into this period of a muted recovery coming out of the recession, our team has done a very good job of streamlining the organization, eliminating waste, so that we can fund R&D and our significant expansion in emerging markets. So we're not starving the organization in terms of a bright future. In fact, I've spent most of my comments today actually on new product launches, and I have to cut them short, otherwise, we'd run out of time for Q&A, right? So we're spending for a bright future, and we feel like we're taking out the appropriate costs to deliver very strong returns for our shareholders. Looking forward, if we continue in this muted growth environment, we believe the ability to drive good bottom line performance is clearly something that we have the skill to do and the ability to do. And as we get into our guidance process for 2014 early in the year, we'll articulate our plans. But we've lived through periods of rapid growth, we've lived through a couple of recessions, and we've lived through a period of muted growth. And pretty consistent to that is we've been very focused on driving bottom line improvement.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Just, as a quick follow-up to that, just as a point of clarification, as you mentioned with Life, you're getting closer to day 1 planning in place, getting closer to that, potentially closing that acquisition. As you go and talk to investors, is the number that you talk -- I'm trying to think about -- do we think about the core Thermo business still getting the margin expansion that you would get otherwise, and then layering on top of that what you expect from Life?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I mean, at a simplistic level, yes. I mean, what we'll do is, when we give out the -- when we close the transaction and give out the guidance, we'll bridge the details enough so that everyone can understand what we're doing. But our base business without Life continues to have to generate good earnings growth. And then obviously, you're going to get the positive synergies and accretions from that acquisition as well on top of that.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Marc, I wanted to dig in a little on China, maybe just get some color there. Within your China business, can you give us some sense of how the different segments did within China? And specifically, like on the more industrial side of your business, have you seen any change, either for the better or for the worse?", "Marc N. Casper", "So industrial -- core industrial continues to be soft in China. So that's going to affect the Analytical Technologies segment the most. There were certainly bright spots on the applied markets in China, particularly air quality continues to be strong in that market. Health care continues to be a good growth driver as well, so Specialty Diagnostics will benefit from that. And then mass spec had a very, very strong quarter in China as well. So that gives you a little bit of a flavor. Headwinds continue in industrial, the rest of the business performing solidly.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And the same maybe on the LPS side, which you had pretty strong growth certainly this quarter, I know you highlighted the clinical trial logistics business. Can you -- could you just break it down like how the channel business converts to clinical trials business? And on the channel side, is this share gains or you're just growing in line with the market right now?", "Marc N. Casper", "We had good, good momentum in our channel business in the quarter. We had very strong momentum in our clinical trials logistics business. I would say that our share in our channel business, we probably grew share slightly in the quarter, and that's not growing hugely different from the rate of the market but probably a little faster than the market.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just -- I don't know if you are going to answer this, but I'm going to ask you anyway. Obviously, there's been a lot of FX moves since you guys first announced the Life transaction and some of your accretion expectations for that transaction. Can you -- are you in the point where you're just can sort of update sort of what your expectations are for that just considering [ph] -- how the currencies have moved all over the place?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes. Certainly, there's a lot of things that have changed since April 15 on the Life acquisition pluses and minuses, and so I'm not going to answer one piece of that equation. So we'll give you updated guidance once we close the transaction.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Great. And I guess, speaking of the U.S. academic markets and some of the uncertainty there, just like what's your sort of working assumption for that customer segment as we sort of look about -- look into Q4? And if you sort of look into 2014, I mean, are you expecting that segment of the market to be flattish? I'm just curious in terms of what your current planning is.", "Marc N. Casper", "So let me limit it to what we saw and a little bit on Q4. We'll deal with all of '14 holistically through our guidance process. Let me start -- longer term, as you take it out of years, I don't think we're -- our view on academic and government continues to be the same, which is going to be a low single-digit growth market for us in the long term, not so different than what we talked about at the Analyst Meeting. I don't think there's a big change even with all the stuff going on in Washington. So when I look at the performance in academic and government, year-to-date, we're down low single digits, I mean, basically. And our view for the fourth quarter is fairly similar to that environment. Basically, we're not assuming a particularly material effect from the government shutdown. Obviously, a little bit of a headwind. But we also know that sequestration is certainly with us for the rest of the year, so that means that -- any optimism that maybe sequestration would go away this year, that fades, from customers' viewpoint. So similar to Q3 is how we're thinking about it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "First one, just on pharma and some of the trends. Obviously, you guys have had really good momentum there. Can you maybe just talk about the sustainability of those trends? And the deals seem to be getting a bit bigger. At the same time, we see the Merck news about cutting R&D. So maybe just talk on your view on the pharma business for the next quarter or 2.", "Marc N. Casper", "If we look back now over the past few years, we've been growing well above the company average share. We're clearly gaining share. Our customers are benefiting from the productivity that we deliver for them, and we feel like our value proposition is very well suited to help customers navigate a tough environment. So we never like any of our customers to be struggling, but what I can tell you is that we're on the phone the minute those issues happen, and we're they're coming out with new ways of helping them navigate those environments. Our clinical trials logistics business, obviously, has done very well for quite some time. And the reason for that is we're just substantially lower cost than the in-house capability, and our quality and performance metrics are truly outstanding, so customers are getting comparable or better quality at a lower cost. And as customers are tightening their belts, they've been driving more and more business to us, and we've been cross-selling across the portfolio as well. So our view is that it's our job to help our customers be successful, and we'll continue to focus on navigating that environment going forward.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then just a follow-up on mass spec. You spend a lot of time talking about the new products. Can you talk about the degree to which those new products are seeing uptick in the clinical segments? I mean I think that was one of the things out of ASMS was just mass spec moving more into the clinical side. And then can you also just talk about competitive dynamics to the extent you think you're taking share, both in mass spec and then LC with the Dionex addition?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So for -- clinical research is growing in importance for us. It's still early in terms of the adoption for us, but it's -- but we're seeing some of it in clinical research. And the new products have done very well. We started shipping the products in the quarter. The uptake has been very strong. And one of the things I'm very passionate about is that the Q Exactive, which is -- we launched a couple years back, just had a fabulous quarter, right? So we launched another high-end system, but we don't lose any momentum in the Q Exactive. I wasn't expecting to lose any momentum because it serves a different market, but it's nice to actually see the facts play out that way in terms of performance. HPLC was very strong for us, so I feel good about how our teams are executing around the world.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen and Company.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "One thing I'm having a hard time reconciling is better-than-expected LPS growth in the quarter and the negative commentary on the academic/government end market in the U.S. I say this because, in the past, you pointed out that LPS was the segment you thought would get most impacted by U.S. government weakness. And I believe that's what was at least previously embedded in guidance. So the question is, has there been a notable source or are there notable sources of upside within LPS outside academic/government that have exceeded your expectations? And then is the offset that academic/government weakness has been maybe a bit more pronounced in either AT or maybe even Specialty Diagnostics than you expected?", "Marc N. Casper", "This is a great question. So when you look at the academic and government performance, you see the pressures in AT and in LPS. But the consumable mix is the vast majority in LP&S (sic) [LPS], so it's more muted, the effect, than the capital equipment effect that you would see in AT. So you see some pressures, Doug, in the Lab Products and Services, but you see a lot more pressure on more the routine capital equipment, which is in the other segments, so that's part of it. The other thing is because pharma is overrepresented, it's a good thing, in Lab Products and Services, that's really been a very strong driver of that. Because you have a clinical trials logistics business there, our channel business, our lab consumables, things that are very pharma and biotech focused, we have a disproportionate weighting in that segment. So I think those factors would say why does the performance consistently look very strong in Lab Products and Services.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. So SG&A spend was a bit lower than, I think, some of us expected. This is probably largely because of mix and some progress you're making on the PPI side. That said, I am wondering if some of this is also a function of planning for the closure of the Life deal. You guys have been executing well to plan this year, but I think it's also fair to say that Life's performance has been a bit disappointing relative to expectations. So point here is some of the SG&A pullback related to what's been going on in Life as you move towards the closure of the deal.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Yes, so in terms of the SG&A, we certainly are still continuing to make investments in the business. The leverage we're getting in SG&A year-over-year is really about the restructuring activity that we're doing and PPI activities that drive costs out of the system. So they're really not any material impact related to planning for Life. Obviously, there's a very small piece of our company that's really directly overlapping with Life in terms of the cost base, so that's not anything that's impacting the numbers.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And if I could sneak in one more.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "You guys continue to do really well in APAC and rest of world, and you recognize strong underlying demand in these markets. But across most end markets in these geographies, it does appear like you're outperforming many of your peers. I guess, what I'm wondering is, how much of your outperformance in these geographies versus your competitors is attributable to you having a better reach than your competitors in your opinion? And are there opportunities you're actively looking at where you could repeat what you did with China, environmental? And more generally, are you thinking it might make sense, given really what have become kind of long-standing trends in these geographies to accelerate really reallocation of sources to areas, say, in Latin America or certain areas of APAC?", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So Doug, thanks. A few things. One of -- I'll mention one more time, this the China CDC order in lab equipment. We moved one of our business units, actually a large one, the headquarters to China about a year ago basically to position this business for the very strong funding environment that's likely to continue for many years in China. So we're always looking at our portfolio around the world and trying to optimize it to position us for growth. I think the combination with Life Technologies actually gives us some interesting opportunities, where the markets in some other countries might have been just a little subscale for us to really want to put the infrastructure in place to build a very, very superior experience for our customers but the combined entity is worth doing. So I think when you get down to the South Koreas of the world, parts of Southeast Asia, we're going to be able to replicate the very strong capabilities we have in China in some of these markets, not at the same level of cost or investment but just because we have enough scale that we're going to get a quick enough return to do it. So I actually think the combination will position us for better growth over time.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to start maybe with a bigger concern thought on just gaining wallet share across 2 of your specific end markets, one being academic and pharma and the second being pharma. And the reason I ask is you're probably looking at a period of protracted slowdowns in funding in academia, there's been, obviously, some continued cuts in the pharma side. So just thematically, if you look at the combined portfolio you have and the competitive advantage you have with channel, are there a couple of new initiatives you can specifically point to where you think you think you can use the franchise to gain wallet share in a slower growth environment?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes. So, Isaac, obviously, we've been doing this with pharmaceutical customers for quite some time, and we'll continue to do that. So we think that a -- that type of requirement of productivity from our customers is always a good opportunity and the fact that we have a stronger offering in production chemicals now, and when we close Life Technologies, an even stronger offering in some of the life sciences research reagents, it will give us more opportunities to go to those customers and bring new value and help them navigate the environment. On the academic and government side or academic side, decision-making is a little bit different, but the economic needs are the same, right? You're dealing more at the lab level than the enterprise level. And I had the chance to meet with a number of academic customers this week, actually, here in Boston because of ASH. She[ph]is here. And they love the Thermo Fisher value proposition, how we can help navigate what's a tough environment for them. So it's more at the micro level, but we can help them save money, so they can continue doing the important research they're doing, and then it's a great opportunity.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then just a tactical question. You guys called out in your prepared comments a couple times you've strengthened the transplant diagnostics business. So I'm wondering, should we expect that kind of pacing to continue through the balance of this year? How do you feel about the prospects over the next 12 months, just given that you have the asset under your control for full 12 months now? And do you think you can maybe accelerate the growth from here? Just trying to gauge expectations for that specific business.", "Marc N. Casper", "As you look -- we had assumed kind of mid-single-digit growth when we announced the acquisition. It's been growing at the high single digits. We think the business has good momentum. It'll start to show up in our organic growth. Not a huge business, but it's a nice business that the integration has gone incredibly smoothly, and the team's done a great job. So we're going to -- we'll try to maximize the top line performance that we can get out of it. And certainly, that's embedded in our guidance as we set that out for 2014.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "When you look at the analytical instruments business, did we go into a double dip or what happened in 3Q while the industrial market-- did it delay or what do think the color is there?", "Marc N. Casper", "Industrial, I don't think it changed much. Basically, we just haven't seen an upswing, right? And when you get into all of the details, basically, it's the core industrial, the commodity material markets continue to be very soft. That's where we have our largest mix of that part of the business. Applied markets, clearly, there's some nice pockets of strength, so I didn't really see a big change in the third quarter, Paul.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And that's what, spectroscopy, gas chromatography, those kind of things?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I mean, you have your chemical analysis, instruments, your process instruments, molecular spectroscopy, those types of instruments would be most affected. Portable instruments would be another one that would be affected by the economic downturn.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And then, Marc, these PMI readings have been pretty strong at least until -- we don't know what this month is, but PMI has been good. I mean, if PMI drives better sales, what do you think the lag factor is, is it -- should it show up this quarter, or should it show up next quarter, what's your experience?", "Marc N. Casper", "Usually, 2 quarters lag is typically what we see in our business. So we're definitely paying attention to that. That's clearly positive news, but it hasn't sustained yet in terms of orders momentum at this point.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "And last, were you surprised by pharma and biotech in the quarter?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, it's been incredibly consistent with high single-digit growth now for quite a number of quarters, so the team's doing a good job of executing.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Arias of UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Marc, maybe on -- another on the industrial markets. How do you feel about where those customers are broadly in their product cycle? Do you feel like if you remove the macro factors from the purchasing, which is in there, you're sort of left with a decent portion of that segment, that's maybe due for a tech upgrade?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, what I would say is that our product portfolio, ourselves internally, is very strong. We've been launching a number of new products. So as customers release funds, we think we're well positioned to capture market share. I think, basically, customers are being cautious right now. And when we get to a period of a little bit more optimism in the customer base, I think we're very well positioned to see an acceleration of growth.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "And maybe one on diagnostics. What are your thoughts at this point on penetrating the U.S. physician base with the Phadia products that do sell well up in Europe -- well in Europe? Do you feel like, over the near term and the midterm, you have the ability to convert a portion of that market that's kind of like doing prick testing and sort of an antiquated way of going about things?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, I would say that we're expecting to see us building momentum in driving penetration in the U.S. for our allergy products. It's -- we do a lot of doctor -- end doctor visits to explain the technology and do education. And as that education becomes stronger and stronger, we think that we're well positioned to have good growth.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citigroup.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "A question on Lab Products and Services, the revenue side has been quite strong, but what kind of struck me was the operating margin of the business at 14.9%. I've looked back last 2 years or so, and this is probably the highest it's been. You said that productivity is kind of the reason for the op margin expansion. And I was wondering if you could go into some detail about how much headway you still have on op margin expansion in that business.", "Peter M. Wilver", "When you say headway, you mean headroom or?", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Headroom, yes.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, I think, obviously, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, it's a little more challenging to get a margin expansion just because of the mix of self-manufactured versus sourced products. So this is a really strong performance for that quarter, but we still have room to expand margins. I would say, on an annual basis, if we're thinking about 50 to 100 basis points at the company level, you're probably in the 20 to 40 basis points range here in this segment is what you could expect as long as we get mid-single-digit kind of organic growth.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. And then, second, just in Analytical Technologies, I was wondering if you could give some color on BioProcess Production in the quarter.", "Marc N. Casper", "So we had good growth in BioProcess Production in the quarter, not as strong as the first half, but the pipeline looks incredibly strong. So I would say that it's growing well, well above the company average, and I feel like we're well positioned.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Anything, Marc, that drove the less-than-strong performance there versus the first half? Any more color you can give?", "Marc N. Casper", "It was actually a strong performance, but we've been growing double digits for a while, and this was more in the mid to high single digits. I don't think there's anything much to it. I looked at the pipeline, and it looks like the next few quarters look strong.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I was wondering if you could give some more color on Brazil. You said it grew over 20% in that market. Can you talk about what's driving the growth and how sustainable it is?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, we've had a few good quarters now in a row in Brazil. Our diagnostic business, in particular, is driving good growth in that market. So there had been some changes in the reimbursement and regulatory environment that had put some pressures on that business over the past year or so, and that's clearly subsided. That's been probably the biggest driver.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "And then on the clinical trials logistics business, can you talk about what's driving the growth there? How much of that is shift towards outsourcing versus you adding additional services? And can you update us on the competitive landscape in that market?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so it's really about the outsourcing trends, it's what's driving it. And what customers are doing is most of the biopharma customers\u2019 use us in some fashion, but it's the question of how penetrated we are. And for the most part, we have lots of opportunity to increase our share of wallet, if you will. So it's less about new services than it is going from being surplus capacity to being a portion of capacity, to being the sole-source provider of that capacity, and we're seeing more and more customers move towards using us as the sole or primary provider, and that's a great opportunity, and we think we got lots and lots of legs in that strategy in terms of driving growth.", "Operator", "Our final question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Two things for you. One, I was wondering if you could just comment on how you're thinking about the 3 different business units and their growth in the fourth quarter as compared to their growth this past quarter. And then secondly, just do you have any early read on what the flu season is looking like? And any thoughts on the impact to the company from that?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of the 3 segments, I would say that the fourth quarter would be pretty similar to what we saw in the first 9 months of the year. And, Pete, do you want to comment quickly on flu?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, in terms of flu, we definitely have a tough comparison in Q4. We had a very strong flu season in 2012. And basically, what's assumed in our guidance right now is that we have kind of an average flu season. We don't have any good insight yet on the strength of the season.", "Marc N. Casper", "So let me wrap it up. As we look sitting here in October, we have 3 strong quarters behind us, and we're on track to achieve our growth goals for the year. Life Technologies integration planning is progressing very well. I'm really confident that we'll be in an excellent position going into 2014, and I'm looking forward to updating you early in the year. Thank you, again, for your time this morning and, certainly, for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until February 28, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2013 fourth quarter and full-year earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 28, 2013, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2013 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper", "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. First, I'm pleased to report that we had an excellent fourth quarter. Our teams really executed well to deliver outstanding results across the board. Our strong finish resulted in a very good year for Thermo Fisher, and puts us in a great position going into 2014.", "Now I know that you're all waiting for news on our close of Life Technologies, so let me give you a very quick update. We're working with the FTC to obtain the last regulatory clearance. We believe we are close and expect to complete the transaction very shortly. Given where we are in the process, we're including Life Technologies in our 2014 guidance, assuming an early February close date. I'll talk more about Life Technologies a little later on. But let me start by covering our financial performance in the fourth quarter. I'll then cover some of the highlights of the past year, talk about Life, and wrap up with our guidance for 2014.", "So starting with the quarter, I have to say our teams did a fantastic job of delivering excellent results on both the top and bottom line. Our revenue for the quarter was a record, growing 6% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 9% for the quarter and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 20%. Our strong operating performance led to a record adjusted EPS of $1.43 for a 5% increase over Q4 of 2012. Our teams really intensified their focus on our customers and took full advantage of some year-end growth opportunities that materialized with certain customers. We also continued to drive productivity hard as we had all year long to deliver a strong bottom line. Overall, it was an outstanding quarter by all measures.", "Let me give you some color on our quarterly performance in each of our 4 end markets. Our strong top line growth at the end of the year was a combination of 2 things: pockets of improvement in some of our markets; and also good execution that allowed us to benefit from them. In 2 end markets, industrial and applied and health care and diagnostics, we saw some improved market conditions in the quarter and our businesses serving these customers grew in line with the company average. Let me cover each of them in a little more detail.", "In industrial and applied, we saw an uptick here overall at the year-end due to the release of funding for some projects that had been delayed during the course of the year. Applied markets continued to be relatively strong for us, as they had been all year, led by demand for our chromatography systems used in environmental and food safety applications. In core industrial markets, we still haven't seen an inflection point in our orders yet, so these markets continue to be soft, as they had been for most of 2013.", "Turning to healthcare and diagnostics. Demand for our clinical diagnostics products remain strong, as it had all year, and our team continues to grow our share position. I'm also pleased to report that our transplant diagnostics business continue to perform very well.", "Looking at the healthcare and diagnostics market from a geographic perspective, we saw ongoing strength in Asia Pacific and improving conditions in Western Europe. In the U.S., where conditions have been soft earlier in the year, we believe we benefited from a modest increase in health care utilization toward the end of the year.", "Turning to pharma and biotech. We had an exceptional performance and grew by more than 10% in the quarter. We have particularly strong results across our clinical trials logistics, BioProcess Production and Laboratory Products businesses. This says that our pharma and biotech customers are continuing to recognize our unique value proposition and as a result, we're gaining share of wallet with these accounts.", "Finally, in academic and government end markets, our results were consistent with what we saw in the first 9 months of the year, again declining in the low-single digits.", "In summary, the improvements in industrial and applied and healthcare and diagnostic end markets and exceptional performance of our pharma added up to a strong quarter of top line growth. Our teams executed very well to capture the market opportunities and deliver a strong finish to the year.", "That's a good segue to discuss our results for all of 2013. First, this was another outstanding year of operational execution across the company. I'm incredibly proud of the way our team stepped up and powered through the challenging environment to achieve their goals on both the top and bottom line. They did a great job of managing costs while keeping their eye on the ball in terms of exceeding our top line growth expectations. We continue to execute our growth strategy and had numerous successes during the year, which I'll cover in a moment.", "Looking at our financial performance for all of 2013. We continued our long track record of delivering strong adjusted EPS, achieving 10% growth over 2012. We really set ourselves apart here in the industry last year. We achieved strong adjusted EPS even though we suspended our share buybacks in light of the pending acquisition of Life Technologies. We also faced significant headwinds from FX, but were able to offset them through effective contingency planning by driving productivity through our PPI Business System. We expanded our adjusted operating margin for the full year by 50 basis points and we did that while continuing to invest for growth. As I said a few weeks ago at 2 investor conferences, when you look back at 2013, we were the exception in the life sciences space in terms of margin expansion, and we owe that performance to outstanding execution by our teams across our businesses.", "Turning to the top line. Our revenue for the full year grew by 5% to a record $13.09 billion. Our strong revenue performance in the fourth quarter pushed us above the high end of our most recent annual guidance. In a challenging environment, we solidly achieved our goals for the year for 3 main reasons. First, we have the operational discipline that's ingrained in our PPI Business System. Second, we had well thought-out contingency plans that were also very well executed so we were able to respond quickly to changes in the economic environment, in particular, the significant impact of adverse foreign exchange last year. And through it all, we remain focused on our customers and continue to make excellent progress in executing our growth strategy by developing innovative new products, expanding our presence in high-growth emerging markets and strengthening our unique value proposition.", "Let me now use our growth drivers to recap a few of the highlights for 2013. First, let's talk about technology innovation. We had a very strong year in developing high-impact new products. And what really made it stand out was that we had successful product launches across our portfolio, including analytical instruments, Bioproduction and Specialty Diagnostics. It was a long list of new products, but let me cover the highlights, starting with analytical instruments.", "We talked a lot about the Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid, so I won't get into the details again, but this is a revolutionary mass spec product and a game-changer for our research customers. Fusion got off to a great start after launch, and we're expecting it to become $100 million-products. Our 2 new triple-quad systems have also been well received. So it was an outstanding year for strengthening our mass spectrometry leadership.", "In chromatography, you'll recall that we had a significant upgrade of our gold standard Chromeleon data system, and our HPLC business continues to perform very well. We also introduced new generation in our industry-leading elemental analysis platform with the powerful iCAP 7000 system for environmental markets.", "Turning to Bioproduction. We launched a new single-use bioreactor and our first bench top process mass spec for biologics research. And finally, in Specialty Diagnostics, we introduced a number of tests and assays. We're clearly a company that's committed to innovation and using advanced technologies to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.", "Turning to our second growth driver, Asia Pacific and emerging markets, we continue to make excellent progress here to build on our strength in these high-growth regions. As you heard throughout 2013, China was a standout, with our teams there delivering 20% growth for the year. We've invested to strengthen our R&D, manufacturing and commercial capabilities, including the expansion of our China Innovation Center last June. And we're clearly using our scale and depth of capabilities to differentiate Thermo Fisher in that region.", "We see many opportunities as we broaden our scope in China to include the Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities where there's growing demand for better health care, a cleaner environment and safer food supplies. We made great progress last year in other high-growth markets as well, such as Brazil and South Korea, and this will continue to be a key element of our growth strategy going forward. The third element of our growth strategy is our unique customer value proposition. This is all about fully leveraging our premier brands and the strength of our company to drive innovation and productivity for our customers.", "I mentioned this a bit earlier in the context of our pharma and biotech end market, but let me just add here that we've continued to gain share by working with these customers as a true partner. They have really come to rely on our proven track record of delivering value for them. I met with the CEOs of many of our largest accounts already this year. In today's environment, these customers recognize that we're uniquely positioned to help them be more competitive. As a result, these accounts continue to grow above the company average. We continue to target new accounts and we're excited about the additional growth opportunities we have here. With the addition of Life Technologies, our customer value proposition will become even stronger.", "Let me now spend a few minutes on the Life Technologies acquisition, which we expect to complete very shortly. I think you know what Life Technologies will bring in the way of capabilities. We talked about this a lot during the year and many of you are already very familiar with the company. It's highly respected as one of the world's leading life science research companies. In terms of the financial contribution, Life Technologies will add nearly $4 billion of revenue to our business. It will become our fourth operating segment called Life Sciences Solutions, which will also include a number of Thermo Fisher's biosciences business.", "As we said when we originally announced the transaction, we expect to generate $275 million of adjusted operating income synergies by year 3, which we validated during our integration planning. So we'll get off to a great start here. Looking at earnings accretion, we now expect to add between $1.25 and $1.30 of adjusted EPS in the first full year. This is above the range of $0.90 to $1 that we initially estimated when we announced the deal last April.", "Pete will walk you through the details, but at a high-level, the increase is based on the completion of our financing, integration planning and the impact of previously announced divestitures. So we're committed to delivering significant accretion in the first 12 months of ownership, a very good position to be in and clearly creating shareholder value even in the short term.", "When I think about the value this combination will create for our customers, it will align perfectly with our growth strategy. Technology innovation, it will add important capabilities in genomics and next-gen sequencing that we don't have today. Let me also remind you that combined, our R&D budget will be, by far, the largest in our industry at more than $700 million.", "In emerging markets, Life Technologies will fortify our presence in our fastest growing markets, such as China, South Korea and Brazil. In China alone, we will now have a business with more than $1 billion of revenues and an outstanding team of 3,800 colleagues. We will strengthen our customer value proposition by adding another premier life sciences brand. The Life Technologies offering will give us a leadership position in bioscience reagents and equipment.", "To summarize, our value proposition will include the leading positions in genomics, proteomics and Specialty Diagnostics. We'll be the only company that has this powerful combination. These are exciting times for Thermo Fisher. We look forward to closing the transaction and executing a smooth and successful integration so we can quickly demonstrate the value it will create for our customers, our employees and our shareholders.", "I'll now spend a few minutes on our guidance for the year, as I mentioned, and this includes the results of Life Technologies, assuming an early February close date. Pete will review our guidance in more detail and outline all of the assumptions behind it. But at a high-level, we're anticipating a modest improvement in some of our end markets in 2014. So with that as backdrop, we're expecting to achieve adjusted EPS in the range of $6.70 to $6.90, which would result in 24% to 27% growth over our strong EPS performance in 2013. In terms of the top line, we expect to achieve revenue in the range of $16.63 billion to $16.83 billion for 27% to 29% revenue growth year-over-year.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a couple of takeaways. First, our teams worked with amazing intensity on all fronts throughout 2013, and that effort resulted in a year that we're all very proud of. Our success puts us in a strong position going into 2014. Second, we're looking forward to closing the Life Technologies acquisition and excited about the many opportunities we will have to combine our strengths and create a company that is truly unrivaled in our industry.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. Apparently, someone on the call has an open line other than us. [Operator Instructions]", "Given that this is a year-end call and we expect to close the Life Technologies acquisition shortly, I have a number of topics to cover in my remarks this morning. I'll start with an overview of our Q4 and full-year 2013 financial performance for the total company, and by segment; then provide you with a recap of the Life Technologies acquisition financing; briefly discuss our new segment reporting structure, which went into effect as of January 1; and conclude with our 2014 guidance.", "So starting with our financial performance, as you saw in our press release, and heard from Marc, we delivered a strong quarter resulting in a 5% increase in adjusted EPS to a record of $1.43. For the full year, adjusted EPS was also a record at $5.42, up 10% from $4.94 last year. GAAP EPS was $0.92 in Q4 and $3.48 for the full year compared to $1.04 and $3.21 in Q4 and full-year 2012, respectively.", "Looking at the top line, Q4 total revenue and organic growth revenue both increased 6% year-over-year in the quarter. The effect of both acquisitions and foreign exchange on Q4 reported revenue was immaterial. For the full year, total revenue increased 5% year-over-year and organic revenue was up 3%, exceeding the high end of our most recent guidance as a result of our very strong results in Q4. Full year reported revenue includes 2% growth from acquisitions and a nominal negative impact from FX.", "Although the net revenue impact from FX for the year was minimal, the mix of currencies specifically the weakening of the Japanese yen negatively impacted earnings in both the quarter and the year. For the quarter, FX resulted in 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.01 or 1% of adjusted EPS dilution compared to 2012. And for the full year, the FX impact was 25 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution and $0.09 or 2% of adjusted EPS dilution. In terms of backlog, bookings slightly exceeded revenue in the quarter.", "By geography. For the quarter, North America revenue grew in the low-single digits. Europe grew just above the company average and Asia Pacific grew in the low teens, with China growing in the mid-teens. Rest of world grew in the mid-teens, primarily driven by Latin America. And for the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the low-single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the high-single digits and rest of world grew in the low teens.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q4 adjusted operating income increased 9% and we delivered very strong adjusted operating margin of 20%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 7% and adjusted operating margin was 19.5%, up 50 basis points from 2012, and at the high end of our previous guidance.", "Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter and full year were driven by very strong contribution from our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI Business System. In line with our previous communications, we realized benefits from our restructuring actions of $19 million in Q4 and $85 million for the full year. In terms of supporting our growth initiatives, we continue to make strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our presence in emerging markets and continue our growth momentum in those regions.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 44.3% in Q4, down 40 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to unfavorable mix from higher growth in our Laboratory Products and Services segment, as well as investments in our emerging markets service infrastructure. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 44.2%, down 30 basis points from 2012, similarly driven by unfavorable mix in service investments, as well as unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 21.3% of revenue, 80 basis points favorable to the 2012 quarter as a result of volume leverage and our productivity actions. And we made great progress for the year with adjusted SG&A at 21.6% of revenue, 90 basis points below 2012.", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 3% of revenue both for the quarter and the full year, essentially in line with 2012. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was -- in 2013 was 5.3%, similar to 2012.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $62 million, up $2 million from last year. We incurred $5 million of interest expense in the quarter or $0.01 of adjusted EPS dilution, which was not included in our previous guidance as a result of the bonds we issued in December to fund the Life Technologies acquisition.", "For the full year, net interest expense was $234 million, which was $18 million above 2012, due to the full year impact of the debt we issued in Q3 2012 to fund the One Lambda acquisition, as well as the impact of the Life Technologies bond financing. Adjusted other income in Q4 was a loss of $1 million, down $4 million from Q4 2012. And for the full year, it was $4 million, down $5 million from the prior year, both primarily as a result of higher non-operating currency transaction losses. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 15.9%, which was 70 basis points higher than last year and about 100 basis points higher than our previous guidance, primarily as a result of the Q4 statutory tax law change in a foreign jurisdiction. For the full year, our adjusted tax rate was 14.7%, 200 basis points lower than last year as a result of tax synergies from our 2012 acquisitions, as well as our ongoing tax planning efforts.", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $54 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter and $216 million for the full year. There were no share buybacks in the quarter, but for the full year, we repurchased 90 million of shares prior to suspending our buyback program in connection with the Life Technologies acquisition. Average diluted shares were 370.9 million in Q4, up 9.2 million or 3% from last year, primarily as a result of option dilution and the accounting impact of the equity forward contract we entered into in Q2. For the full year, average diluted shares were 365.8 million, down 0.8 million from 2012.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, full year cash flow from continuing operations was $2.02 billion and free cash flow was $1.75 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $262 million. Full year free cash flow was essentially flat with the prior year, as higher cash net income was offset by increased working capital investment, as well as financing fees and transaction costs for the Life Technologies acquisition. We ended the quarter with $5.83 billion in cash and investments, up $3.98 billion sequentially from Q3, driven by the proceeds from the December bond issuance that I mentioned previously, but also as a result of our free cash flow. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $10.5 billion, up $3.4 billion from Q3 as a result of the bond issuance.", "Let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC for 2013 was 10.1%, up 30 basis points from Q3 and up 80 basis points from 9.3% a year ago. So we continue to make good progress on this important metric.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our 3 business segments. Starting with Analytical Technologies. In Q4, total revenue grew 6% and organic revenue also grew 6%. In the quarter, we had very strong growth in our Life Sciences Mass Spec, BioProcess Production and Chromatography businesses, which benefited from exceptional performance in Asia Pacific. This segment also benefited from the release of funds by select customers in a broad range of end markets for projects that had been delayed, as Marc mentioned in his comments.", "For the full year, both reported an organic revenue grew 3%. Adjusted operating income in Q4 for Analytical Technologies increased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 20.4%, up 50 basis points. The margin expansion was driven by strong pull-through on our top line growth and continued productivity actions, which were partially offset by negative foreign exchange and strategic investments. For all of 2013, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 18.6%, flat with 2012.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew 5% and organic growth came in at 5% as well. In the quarter, we continued to deliver good growth in our clinical diagnostics business, and our immunodiagnostics allergy business grew above the segment average. Our transplant diagnostics business also continued to do well, and Q4 was the first full quarter that it was included in our organic growth. As Marc said, we believe that we saw some favorable year-end health care utilization trends that benefited the segment as a whole.", "For the full year, total revenue grew 8% and organic revenue grew 3%. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% in Q4, with adjusted operating margin at 26.9%. This was up 100 basis points from the prior year, primarily as a result of productivity savings and strong volume pull-through, which was partially offset by investments and foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 14% and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, up 150 basis points from 2012, primarily as a result of the One Lambda acquisition.", "In the Laboratory Products and Services segment. In Q4, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 8%. Our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver very strong growth, and our Laboratory Products business had robust growth as well. Softness in the U.S. academic and government end market continued to be a headwind in this segment. However, similar to Analytical Technologies, this segment benefited from the release of funding for some projects that had been previously delayed. For the full year, reported revenue grew 5% and organic revenue grew 4%. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services grew 9% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 14.4%, up 10 basis points, driven by strong productivity. For the full year 2013, adjusted operating income increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%, up 10 basis points from the prior year.", "So before I move on to our 2014 guidance, I'd like to provide you with a brief update on the Life Technologies financing details now that we expect to close the transaction shortly. I'll also cover the changes to our reporting segments that went into effect on January 1. So in terms of the acquisition financing, it will be a total of $11.1 billion as follows: in Q4 we issued $3.2 billion in bonds, with maturity dates of 3 to 30 years at a current average rate of 3%; $5 billion will come from our term loan facility, which is a variable rate of LIBOR plus 150 basis points that is currently averaging 1.75%; and we'll issue a total of $2.9 billion of common equity representing 34.9 million shares. The remainder of the purchase price will be funded with available cash and commercial paper of approximately $2.5 billion.", "With that, let me briefly update you on some changes we're making to our reporting segments. Effective January 1 of this year, the company's financial performance will be reported in 4 segments. The details are included in our financial reconciliation package in the Investors section of our website, but the major changes are as follows.", "First, we've added a new segment called Life Sciences Solutions, which consist of the majority of the former Life Technologies and Thermo Fisher biosciences businesses. Our Global Chemicals business, which sells a high percentage of its revenue through the Fisher Scientific channel, is being transferred from biosciences to the Laboratory Products and Services segment. As a result, our annualized sales eliminations will decrease. But this will be partially offset by increased eliminations for products currently sold by Life Technologies through the Fisher Scientific channel.", "Next, our Analytical Technologies segment is being renamed Analytical Instruments to reflect the transfer of biosciences to other segments. Two small Specialty Diagnostics businesses within Life Technologies are becoming part of the Specialty Diagnostics segment. And finally, as previously announced, we have agreed to sell our sera and media, gene modulation, and magnetic beads businesses to GE Healthcare.", "So there are a number of changes, not the least of which is the addition of Life Technologies to our results. At the total company level, going forward, we'll be reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology of excluding the results of Life Technologies until we reach the anniversary date of the acquisition. When we report our actual results beginning in Q1, we do intend to provide organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis for the life sciences solutions segment as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you insight into the growth performance of that segment.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2014 guidance. In terms of acquisition and divestiture assumptions, our guidance includes Life Technologies assuming an early February close date. And for the previously announced divestitures, we've assumed a mid-Q1 sale date. Our guidance does not include any other future acquisitions or divestitures. As you saw in our press release, we're initiating a 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.70 to $6.90, which represents growth of 24% to 27% over our 2013 adjusted EPS of $5.42.", "In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $16.63 billion to $16.83 billion, which is 27% to 29% above our reported revenue of $3.09 billion in 2013. On an organic basis, this represents year-over-year growth of about 3% to 4% with the midpoint similar to our actual results in 2013. Again, this measure of organic growth does not include the results of Life Technologies.", "To bridge our organic growth between the 2 years, we expect to pick up about 50 basis points each in academic and government and industrial and applied as a result of modestly stronger end markets. We expect this to be offset by roughly 100 basis points of lower contribution from pharma and biotech, following our strong high single-digit growth in this end market for the last 2 years. We still expect good growth in the mid-single digits in this end market, given the strength of our value proposition, but we expect the comparison will be challenging. We also expect to see a small amount of dilution from the acquisition-related divestitures as they were growing faster than the company average.", "In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year-over-year foreign currency impact on our revenue will be minimal. However, similar to 2013, we're expecting an unfavorable margin impact resulting from the mix of currencies, specifically, the continued weakening of the Japanese yen. The Life Technologies acquisition, net of our divestitures, is expected to contribute about 24 to 25 points of our total revenue growth in 2014. To frame the organic revenue growth performance we've assumed in our guidance for the legacy Life Technologies businesses, we're expecting them to grow organically by 2% to 3% in 2014 on a pro forma basis, following 2% organic growth in 2013.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin, we're expecting adjusted operating margin expansion of 220 to 250 basis points, primarily as a result of the addition of Life's financial results, as well as acquisition synergies. We're expecting margin expansion for Thermo Fisher standalone to be about 60 basis points, excluding headwinds of 30 basis points from the divestitures, as well as 30 basis points from FX.", "The drivers of the standalone margin expansion are similar to prior year's: price and volume leverage, our PPI Business System, global sourcing and restructuring. We're assuming about $85 million of synergy benefit in the balance of 2014. This translates to $100 million for the first full year, which is slightly higher than our original guidance of $85 million as we now expect to be able to accelerate some of the synergy benefits after completing the detailed integration planning.", "In terms of our expectations for synergies in the third full year after close, our integration planning work has validated our original guidance of $275 million in cost and revenue synergy benefit.", "Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $420 million to $430 million, up almost $200 million as a result of the debt we issued to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. It's important to note that Life's existing bonds, totaling $2.05 billion, will be recorded on our balance sheet at fair value, resulting in about $50 million of lower P&L interest compared to what Life Technologies expensed in 2013, although cash interest payments remain unchanged.", "We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% consistent with our previous guidance of about 15% for the combined company. We've not included the R&D tax credit in our tax rate estimate, which is about a $20 million benefit for the combined company as it has not yet been approved for 2014. We're assuming that we will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders all in the form of dividends, and that we'll use the bulk of our free cash flow and the proceeds from the divestitures to pay down short-term debt.", "Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 406 million, up 10% to 11% from 2013, reflecting the shares we issued to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. And we're expecting capital expenditures to be in the range of $470 million to $490 million on a full year basis and free cash flow to be in the range of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion.", "In terms of accretion from the Life Technologies transaction, as Marc said, we're now expecting the acquisition to add $1.25 to $1.30 of adjusted EPS in the first full year, compared to our original guidance of $0.90 to $1 and we're expecting about $1.10 to $1.15 of accretion to our fiscal year 2014 earnings. To bridge from the high-end of our original first year accretion guidance of $1 to our current guidance high-end of $1.30, we picked up about $0.38 from a lower share count as a result of issuing 1.1 billion less equity at a higher average price.", "We also picked up about $0.20 from lower interest expense as a result of lower rates and the fair value adjustment of Life's debt, and this was partially offset by about $0.16 due to divestitures and about $0.12 net lower contribution from Life's operations, including synergies, all as a result of more unfavorable FX rates versus our acquisition model assumptions. One final note on guidance, we don't normally provide detail other than annual guidance, but given all the moving parts related to acquisitions and divestitures, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight into what we're expecting for Q1.", "With over $375 million of Life's 2014 revenue occurring pre-close and the divestitures assumed to occur mid-quarter, we're expecting Q1 to represent only about 22% of our full year revenue guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, we're expecting Q1 as a percent of our full year guidance to represent a couple of points less than the comparable revenue percentage as a result of the synergies building throughout the year, and a large piece of the acquisition-related interest expense and share count increase being incurred for the full quarter without a full quarter of Life's operating earnings to offset them. As always, in interpreting our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year.", "So in summary, this past year, we managed our cost base effectively, while continuing to invest for a bright future. We accomplished this by leveraging our PPI Business System and through strong execution by our teams around the globe. As a result, I believe we're well positioned to achieve our growth goals for 2014 and beyond. And our prospects only get brighter with the new capabilities that Life Technologies will bring.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno", "Thanks, Pete. Shannon, we're ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "I guess, first, just maybe briefly, Marc, any sense as to kind of why the delay with the U.S. FTC. And it doesn't sound like, from yours or Pete's comments that they're requiring any additional divestitures than what you already talked about. Is that correct?", "Marc N. Casper", "Jon, yes, in terms of the U.S. FTC, as we said back in April, we expected the transaction to close early in the year, and we're still right on track with that. So we're just finalizing the documentation process but we're not expecting any additional divestitures or anything of that sort.", "Jonathan P. Groberg - Macquarie Research", "Okay. Great. And then maybe a quick follow-up, I guess, as you think about the Life deal closing -- and I appreciate all the tremendous amount of detail that you went through in this call to help us understand all the moving pieces. I guess, Marc, as you think about the deal, though, when you think about bringing them on board and moving your businesses into theirs. A lot of us here, out there in the space in kind of that more molecular biology, genomics space, hear about people transitioning out, hear about new products that are being introduced from competitors. And I'm just curious, as you evaluate that business, evaluate the competitive position, evaluate the R&D spend that's necessary and in some of your own -- kind of, your own markets as well, that you have both opportunities and risks, just maybe how you're thinking about that, not just this year in '14, but maybe over the next couple of years.", "Marc N. Casper", "So -- thanks, Jon. So we've had the benefit of a 9-month integration planning process, where the 2 teams have worked incredibly collaboratively to set out a great integration plan, as well as getting even more familiar with the business. Obviously, we know it quite well. And we're very excited about the prospects. And as I've said on a couple of the recent investment bank conferences, basically, Life Technologies hasn't been doing investor relations strategy for the year. They've been intensely focused on their customers. So you haven't seen a lot of communications, but you have seen a lot of great progress in their base operating business in terms of the things they're doing. So we're really excited about the prospects of the business and we're looking forward to closing, and welcoming our 10,000 new colleagues to Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ross Muken of ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "So Marc, I mean, obviously, a spectacular organic growth rate in the quarter. I mean, this is probably one of your best quarter results in quite a long time. I mean -- I know you touched on some of the upside surprises, but maybe just in terms of where you were most surprised relative to the outperformance, and maybe give us a little bit of cadence of how it proceeded throughout the quarter. Because it seems like from some of the other peers as well, that there was a bit of extra normal budget flush this year than maybe has not happened in some time. So any kind of color you can provide around that would also be helpful.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure, so in terms of just budget release and those types of things, the last couple of years, it's always a question we get asked in the fourth quarter, which is, \"Do you see a budget flush?\" And in those previous 2 years, we didn't see any. Clearly, this year, we saw a release of some funds on projects that had really been delayed, some of which were even considered in 2012. And that cut across a number of customers. So we saw it in Europe, we saw it in big pharma, and we saw it in some of our industrial customers. So it clearly was year-end money. I'm really proud of how nimble the team was, though, in going out and capturing it, right? It's one thing to have funding and another thing to actually convert it into great organic growth. I think the team did a really strong job in that. In terms of the end markets or the positive surprises, I don't think we were surprised as much. I mean, it was nice to see the funds released. I'm very pleased with how we performed in the pharma and biotech market. Our team delivered in excess of 10% organic growth in the quarter, and that's just great execution. So it's not a surprise but it's nice to see it in the bank.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division", "And I guess, relative to the academic channel, I mean, how relieved are you to sort of have that higher degree of budget certainty versus where we are -- where we were last year? And in your conversations with folks throughout that channel, do you feel like we're going to get a bit of a step-up in some portions of the market? And how do you feel like Life's business is sort of positioned for that relative to their outsized exposure bid on at least the NIH campus.", "Marc N. Casper", "So obviously, our academic and government customers over the last few years have faced both weak budgets and uncertainty. And I think the budget process that's going on now, with some 2-year visibility and some modest increases, NIH is clearly an improved environment. So as we look at that and just the lag between the budget and when funds are released, we should see an improvement in the second half of this year in terms of our academic and government growth. And from a Life Technologies perspective, obviously they have a little bit more exposure to academic and government, so it's good news, right? I mean, it's -- it should be a good opportunity for them. And as you look at their performance, as Pete said, they delivered 2% organic growth in 2013, and we're expecting 2% to 3% organic growth or we're assuming 2% to 3% organic growth for 2014. So I think the funding environment should help us on both fronts.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So can you just give us a little bit of color in terms of how instruments versus consumables did in 2013 and -- or how do you sort of see that? Is it sort of morphing in 2014? It's more about trying to figure out how to see the mix of the company shifting and sort of what's implied in the numbers.", "Peter M. Wilver", "Sure. Derik, it's Pete. So in terms of the equipment-consumables-services split, so both equipment and consumables grew low-single digits in 2013, and services grew high-single digits. Consumables was a little bit stronger than equipment and really, that flipped significantly in Q4. I mean, we had really good performance in equipment in Q4, as Marc said, as a release of the budget funds. Going forward, the performance we're expecting is almost exactly the same as in 2013. Now that's, again, on a Thermo Fisher organic basis, so it's not including Life's results, which certainly will be more heavily weighted in consumables when that happens.", "Derik De Bruin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "And so that releases funds in Q4, so was that -- is that the standard budget flush or is there something more that was going on?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think it's hard to tell because it was so widespread. But my take is, is that there was more confidence and economic stability. And I think you've heard me say this in the past, which is in Europe, in particular, every month that something bad doesn't happen in the economy, gives more confidence and more ability for spending to happen. And clearly, we saw the government release some money, as well as some of our larger industrial and pharma customers in Europe released some money as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I actually want to get into some of the give-and-takes in the quarter. You said it's some project delays that came through, I think, in chromatography. I'm wondering if you can touch on that. You called out HLA strengths, so I'm just wondering if there are some underlying dynamics there. And obviously, we hear more from some of the sequencing companies about sequencing moving into that market. So I'm wondering if you can touch on that. And then pharma, were there some big chunky contracts that you got in the past year? Obviously, you're guiding for kind of mid-single-digit growth for pharma. So I'm wondering if you can kind of flesh out your thoughts on the pharma business as well.", "Marc N. Casper", "Sure. So Tycho, let me -- I think I got all of them but if I miss something, just ask and I'll try to give some answer. So on HLA, we had strong organic growth performance all year. The team executed well. One Lambda acquisition's been fabulous, the team's done a great job. So we feel good about it and obviously, we have sequencing technologies for HLA with Life Technologies. So we're obviously playing that -- in that market segment as well. In terms of pharma, no, we didn't have any big contract wins. This is all about share of wallet execution and leveraging our value proposition. I mean, effectively, every big pharma is a customer and what we do is just drive incremental value for those customers across by using our portfolios. So we're driving their productivity, improving their innovation and that's allowed us to grow at great rates. In terms of chrome, chrome is less of a budget flush thing than -- or we've had very good momentum in HPLC throughout the year and we finished off very strongly in HPLC. And we saw some nice momentum in the fourth quarter in ion chromatography with our performance in Europe and in China, in particular.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "And then in terms of how the year ended up, you highlighted that you pulled, I think, $100 million in costs above what you had originally guided to. Can you maybe talk to whether there were some project that were pulled forward in light of the pending integration or was this just kind of executing above plan across-the-board?", "Marc N. Casper", "In terms of cost reduction, as we say each year, we always have a set of contingencies, right? And as we saw the FX environment be extremely negative from an earnings perspective, our teams did a really good job of reducing costs, doing additional restructuring, using our PPI Business System very aggressively to deliver very strong productivity. And that allowed us, really, to deliver very strong margin expansion and earnings growth during the course of the year.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And then last one, did the assumptions on organic growth for Life come down a little bit? I think you talked about 3% organic growth at the Analyst Day, you're now talking 2% to 3%. Is that just the divestitures or is there anything else in there to think about?", "Marc N. Casper", "No, actually, Tycho, on that, we've always said that the long-term growth we've assumed in the model is 3%, and then what we said is that shorter-term, as the end markets have been weaker, we hadn't actually articulated a specific number so -- for sort of the year 1 view. So the 2% to 3% is actually better than where the business has been performing, and we would expect in the midterm that 3% is a good assumption for that business.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "So once again, I'll say what a lot of others have said. Clearly, this was a really great quarter and when you look at LPS, the growth there was as robust as I think you've generated for several years, if ever. One thing that you've done a great job of over the years, and this has come up a couple of times already today, is using your product breadth to gain share of wallet, especially in biopharma. What I'm wondering is, is the Q4 strength at all demonstrative of Thermo having increased success of essentially doing that same thing in other end markets and really, what I'm thinking about specifically, is in health care hospitals?", "Marc N. Casper", "So Doug, obviously, we're always looking for ways to drive value for our customers. And we have done a very strong job in the biopharmaceutical customer set, and you saw that in Q4. When I think about the healthcare and diagnostics arena, where that's most relevant is particularly in China, where we have a customer base that is expanding the network of hospitals and clinics aggressively. And they're looking for a very simple way of getting the health care system expanded, and our offering is quite compelling. So those customers, clearly, are leveraging it. And we see that a bit in the U.S. as well. Our channel helps us drive an attractive mix of products there. So yes, we do it in healthcare and diagnostics, but probably a little bit lesser extent than we do in biotech and pharma.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "I guess what I was trying to get at is, when we do our checks with hospital administrators, hospital CFOs, especially in the U.S., clearly as we all know, there's a lot of pressures in that end market and they're looking for ways to save money. So I just didn't know how material an opportunity there was for you to go in there and as a broad supplier to potentially create a win-win where you're gaining share and at the same time, cutting costs for them in some areas.", "Marc N. Casper", "Clearly, we have a very good position in Specialty Diagnostics and I think we're well-positioned to navigate the landscape that the Affordable Care Act creates. So I think over time, that is an opportunity. And we always are looking to drive value for our customers.", "Douglas Schenkel - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And 1 more. China, clearly, that's been a nice source of growth for you as you just mentioned, not just in hospital health care but in other end markets, with 20% or more year-over-year growth for, I think, at least the past 10 quarters, really, up until this quarter. You still have some nice growth but maybe not as strong as we've seen recently. And there's been some concern over a China slowdown, something that, clearly, hasn't materialized in a big way for you guys. Understanding that Thermo targets some pretty broad end markets, it's not as cyclical as maybe for some other companies. What are your assumptions for growth in China in 2014, and any concerns that things are slowing down there?", "Marc N. Casper", "We're assuming mid-teens growth in 2014 for China. So -- we've enjoyed 20% for a while and we think that mid-teens is a reasonable starting point for the assumption. Demand continues to be strong. Our position continues to get strong, but we think that's a prudent way to start the year from an outlook perspective. And then, obviously, we're seeing a little bit of improvement in the U.S. and Europe, which is the positive that keeps us with a good revenue growth outlook for the year.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Amit Bhalla of Citi.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Marc, I wanted to just hone in on the comment you made on health care utilization ticking up towards the end of the quarter in the U.S. Obviously, it's not the budget flush you're talking about there. So what are the actual signals that you saw that was indicating that comment?", "Marc N. Casper", "So it's a combination, and in the U.S., we saw a fairly widespread improvement across our various businesses. The second thing is, we called a number of our larger customers and just asked them what were they seeing from a dynamic perspective, and that seemed to be the feedback we were getting. So it was broad-based improvement in the second half of the quarter, as well as customers validating they saw a little bit of utilization uptick. That's our best take on what happened.", "Amit Bhalla - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Got it. And secondly, in the past, you have pointed to some of the bigger box companies, such as GE, Siemens and Philips as indicators and you guys have more of a 6-month lag versus what those guys put up. I'm wondering if you can comment on their performance thus far and impacts that you may see in the emerging markets going forward.", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of the outlook and the data that we look at, there seems to be at least some improvements in the metrics in terms of what's going on, holding aside some of the currency issues over the last couple of weeks. So there seems to be a positive outlook. But we do lag it, so it's a little bit early to call.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Daniel Brennan of Morgan Stanley.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Marc, as you meet with investors and customers -- and just to inch in your opinion or your take on what you think is kind of not understood or what's most not understood in terms of what you think the Life deal's going to bring Thermo?", "Marc N. Casper", "So we've had, obviously, the opportunity to have a fair amount of interaction with our investors and our customers. Let me start out with the customers. Very enthusiastic about the combination and looking forward to closing so that we can bring together the unique value proposition that we have. And that has now expanded, right? It gives us a broader set of genomics capabilities, it gives us a leadership position in bioscience reagents. And our customers are looking forward to the combination. So there's a lot of enthusiasm out there. From the investor perspective, I think that the strategy is understood and I think that folks are just really waiting for the transaction to get closed out. And really, probably more than anything, was to get a sense of what was our view on the guidance in terms of accretion. And I think that coming out with $1.25 to $1.30 of first full year contribution shows that the actions that we took in terms of how we financed the transaction, the integration planning, really has put us in a good position to deliver a strong year. So I think that's -- I think these are very exciting times at the company right now. Actually, I've never been more enthusiastic in terms of what our prospects and outlook is like. And I think the team here has done a great job of navigating not the easiest of economies and putting the company in an incredibly bright, incredibly strong position going forward.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Great. And Marc, should we expect, in terms of maybe an updated view, once you do close the deal in terms of the vision and the strategies, is that something that we should expect more so at the Investor Day or could something come prior to that post closing?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think the Investor Day will be the right time frame for kind of the bigger picture items around the business.", "Daniel Brennan - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Okay. And then maybe just circling back to 1 question that came up earlier, just to understand kind of the '14 guidance in terms of the deceleration in pharma/biotech that you're assuming, which impacted kind of offsetting the recovery in kind of academic and industrial and applied. So is this something going from double digits down to mid-single digits in a year? Is that something -- I know someone asked a question before about some big contracts, maybe can you just expand upon kind of what you're seeing in pharma/biotech and is there a level of conservatism in mid-single-digit growth?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think our take on that one, it's not about the big contracts, it's just simply that market, end market, has probably been growing 2 points, roughly, over the last few years, somewhere in that range, 2 to 3. And we've been growing much faster. And when we look at the comparison, we think the starting point of mid-single digit growth, which would represent continued share gain, is the right place to start. And our teams will focus on driving the best possible performance. And as the year unfolds, we'll continue to calibrate on what the outlook is.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Peter Lawson of Mizuho Securities.", "Peter Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division", "I'm going to ask a question around the Ion Torrent business, so please be prepared. So any thoughts about how that business is going to be run? It's a high, R&D-rich business. Any changes in your thoughts around that? And then just the strategy in that business and the focus over the next couple of years?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, so Ion Torrent and the genomics capabilities that Life Technologies brings to the company is very exciting. And as we think about our focus, our focus is really on having very excited, enthusiastic customers. And there's been a huge amount of work that the Life Technologies team has done during the course of 2013, and very ambitious plans in 2014 to position for great success with our customers. I think that what we've talked a little bit about over the last 6 months or so with the investor community is, this is a small proportion of our total revenue, a couple percent of the total company's revenue. So it doesn't get that same heightened focus with the investor community than maybe some other companies might have that are much smaller. But it does get very heightened focus in terms of our customer community, and we're very focused there. So we're excited about Ion Torrent. The business invests very substantially in R&D and the business has what we think will be a very bright future.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Marc, Marc, I just want to kind of dig a little bit deeper on that utilization question earlier regarding the overall health care volume environment. And the reason I ask is it does look like some of the managed care companies talked about a little bit of a pull-forward effect in the fourth quarter, ahead of the ACA implementation. And if that's the case, it would sort of imply you might see a suddenly bigger seasonal dip in the first quarter than you have in the past. So just trying to figure out what you think is baked into assumptions for your guidance this year and how you're seeing that part of the dynamic.", "Marc N. Casper", "For the full year, we're expecting conditions to be pretty much the same for our health care and diagnostics business. So we didn't spend a huge amount of time looking through the seasonality effects of a strong Q4, and does that mean that there will be a little less activity in Q1? I guess it's possible, Isaac, but it shouldn't be hugely material, one way or the other.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And then a similar question for your biopharma end market, I think a similar question was asked, but just maybe a little more specifically, we've seen a lot of noise regarding budget visibility, M&A activity in areas of spec pharma. So I do think there's been a little bit of volatility in -- I'm assuming a lot of volatility in your biopharma R&D customers. So that being said, do you think there's some element of that, that is now, perhaps, a little bit more secular rather than situational? And so I'm just curious sort of how much back-end seasonality you might expect this year in those end markets.", "Marc N. Casper", "That's a good question. I mean, in terms of the seasonality, I think, generally, the customers plan fairly constantly across the year in terms of their activity because it's mostly driven by people and keeping those folks actively engaged in developing new products. So I wouldn't expect a big change in seasonality during the course of the year. I do think the teams just execute incredibly well at Thermo Fisher to grow our share position in the fourth quarter, and I also think there was just a few meaningful projects that customers felt enough confidence in their pipelines to release the funds, which clearly was a nice thing to happen as well.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Just wondering, I know you said 3% to 4% organic growth for the existing Thermo business in 2014. I was wondering if you can provide a little bit more color as it relates to the different reporting segments and what your thoughts are in 2014 versus what you did in 2013.", "Peter M. Wilver", "So actually, all 3 kind of legacy segments are within 20, 30 basis points of the average for the total company. So they're all very close. And then in terms of sort of the year-over-year, it's probably a little stronger in Analytical Technologies and a little weaker in Laboratory Products and Services. Specialty Diagnostics, about the same.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research Company", "Got you. And then just curious on one of the comments you made regarding the kind of end markets and expecting a little bit better industrial growth in 2014. Obviously, we saw much better growth here in the fourth quarter. Just what kind of gives you the outlook or the confidence that industrial gets a little bit better in 2014?", "Marc N. Casper", "I think our expectation is that we'll see some stabilization in the core industrial, and that's what's driving -- applied has been pretty constant and the fact that some funds were released late in the quarter should at least, from a comparison standpoint, tend to stabilize as the year unfolds.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Dan Leonard of Leerink.", "Daniel L. Leonard - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division", "You talked a bit about taking full advantage of the year-end growth opportunity. Was there any opportunity for you to maybe push some of those opportunities into Q1 and thus, offer yourself some cushion in a quarter with a lot of moving pieces?", "Marc N. Casper", "Our take, as you said, just like we don't pull things forward into one year, we don't push things out. We actually just close business when customers want to spend money. So we didn't sit there and say, \"Let's stop working. Holiday time.\" In fact, I spoke to a few of our colleagues, I think it was on the 31st, they weren't probably enjoying it as much, but we worked right until the end of the year and we didn't push anything out into the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird.", "Jeffrey T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division", "I appreciate all the updated thoughts on the cost synergies but I'm wondering, now that you've had additional time to evaluate the business, can you talk about your updated thoughts on the revenue synergies? Because when I look at those, that actually looks like an area of conservatism relative to your historical performance on transactions.", "Marc N. Casper", "So Jeffrey, great question. So when we look at the synergies, $275 million of year 3 synergies, $25 million of earnings from revenue, which is $75 million in revenue. Our assumption is they start in the second year. So there's nothing in that first $100 million that Pete talked about. And then they start to ramp up at the beginning of the second year of ownership. We are very focused on maximizing those synergies, but it's obviously a little bit early. Right? I think it's one of those things where if you look at acquisitions that we've done previously, we've probably driven higher on a percentage basis in terms of revenue synergies. We certainly draw a lot more in the combination of Thermo Fisher, but it's a little bit early to call it out one way or another. So we'll focus on, obviously, maximizing our organic growth long-term and capturing as much synergies as possible. And as it gets a little bit deeper into the integration and we've owned the business for a while, then clearly, we'll talk more about it.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Paul Knight of Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Marc, when you were talking about mass spec and gaining leadership there, people thought you were probably a little crazy or something. But when you look at the business today, are there a couple 3 things that kind of stand out to you, just like that, where you're like going, this is a no-brainer where I'll be the market leader?", "Marc N. Casper", "As I first look back at the lessons learned, right? The first thing we did was ramp up our customer communication focus and actually ramped down our investor relations focus on mass spec. If you think about it, actually -- probably even doing this long enough with us. If you go back a decade ago, we used to talk a huge amount about mass spec and every single product, and every single quarter. And we said, \"You know what? That creates a undue pressure internally as opposed to just have them focus on getting customers to win.\" And the silence allowed us to actually grow our share position with providing less information to our competitors quarter in and quarter out. And I enjoyed the days when people used to kind of say, \"Wow, how could this $100 million mass spec business ever have aspirations back in 2001?\" And today, we're a clear industry leader and customers literally can't wait for the Annual Scientific Conference to see what new breakthrough innovation that we'll bring out. So that methodology is a methodology we use for all of our high-tech businesses. We do it in our handhelds, and I think you can see us -- we're going to do that in some other parts of the portfolio as well. It's all about having the best scientists and creating an environment for them to be able to develop breakthrough products and help our customers win. And that's what is so core to our innovation success at Thermo Fisher.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division", "Yes, great. We'll look forward to that. And then lastly, China, everybody wants to worry about that region every other month. What do you think gives you so much visibility, is it the makeup, that there's a lot of academic or healthcare customers, is it you're building a plant out there, what gives you such confidence?", "Marc N. Casper", "First of all, the 5-year plan is very aligned with what we do, right? In the 5-year plan, around environmental protection, food safety and health care expansion, we're right in the midst of it. When I was meeting with government officials late October, early November, really discussing economic outlook, very clear that the discussion amongst the government officials in China was there's going to be good growth but it's going to be slower than historical growth. But the focus on environment, food safety and health care, incredibly important, especially in the environment. I mean, it's a huge issue about sustainable economic growth, and that positions us incredibly well. I think 5 years ago or so, when we moved our environmental businesses headquarters to China, it might've seemed like a bold move but it's obviously paid off in spades in a huge way. Because we're really considered the domestic provider of those products and we manufacture products locally for the market, and we have a great competitive position. So we feel like we have good growth prospects in China going forward.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brandon Couillard of Jefferies.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Pete, could you elaborate on the core Thermo margin expectations for the year, specifically between gross margin and operating expense growth?", "Peter M. Wilver", "Well, to be honest, it gets a little muddy when you start talking about the details of the P&L because Life Technologies is coming in partial year. As I said, just for standalone Thermo Fisher, we're expecting about 60 basis points of margin expansion in the year, if you add back the loss benefit of the divestitures, which is about 30 basis points and the FX incremental headwind that we're going to experience, which is about 30 basis points. Certainly, when we report our results in Q1, including Life Technologies, our gross margin is going to be up from where it has traditionally been, probably something in the 500 basis points range. Our SG&A will also be up and R&D will be up. And as I said, we're expecting around 230 to 250 basis points of margin expansion for the year.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Could you speak to your net pricing expectations for the year and sort of how that compares versus '13?", "Peter M. Wilver", "So we're actually expecting a little bit of an uptick in pricing in 2014. Pricing was pretty muted all year in 2013, very little positive benefit overall net, and we're probably expecting around 50 basis points positive net in 2014.", "Operator", "Our last question is from Dan Arias of UBS.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Maybe just one on chromatography. How at this point, Marc, are you feeling about Dionex, UHPLC? Obviously, a tough set of competitors there, but do you feel like you can or you are taking a bit of business from the 2 strongholds there, especially given the momentum in mass spec?", "Marc N. Casper", "Yes, Dan, when we look at the HPLC and that UHPLC business that we have, obviously, we're in kind of a #3 position in terms of our market share but at least, as I look at the reported results of the other 2, it appears that we're growing consistently faster than them. So it's a good position to be in. But they're good companies and tough competitors, so we just focus on helping our customers be successful and working to use all of our competitive strengths to gain share in that portion of the business. So we feel good about our outlook there.", "Daniel Arias - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division", "Okay. Actually, maybe let me sneak one more in, and apologies if you mentioned this, but now that you've assumed command of the numbers for Life, should we look for them to report the quarter or are you just going to wait out the close there?", "Marc N. Casper", "So in terms of the process, there'll be an 8-K at some point a little bit later in the quarter that actually report out their final results. So that happens to the SEC process a little bit later in the quarter.", "Okay so let me wrap it up with a couple of last comments. First, we're very pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year and to be in such a great position going into 2014. Our customers are really seeing the value that we've created through our technology innovation, our value proposition and our growing presence in emerging markets. And we're really excited about the new opportunities that we'll have once we complete the acquisition of Life Technologies, and welcoming our new colleagues to the company.", "So thanks for your support for Thermo Fisher, and we look forward to updating you during the course of the year.

Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until May 16, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 first quarter earnings and future expectations is also available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's annual report and 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2013 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "Before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s revenue growth by end market and geography is on an end market basis only, and therefore does not include the performance of Life Technologies.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. I\u2019m pleased to report that we achieved a number of significant milestones in the first three months of the year, and our performance positions us well to meet our goals for 2014.", "First, as you all know, we closed on the acquisition of Life Technologies in early February. I\u2019ve spent quite a bit of time since then travelling to our new sites in the U.S. and Europe to do business reviews, hold town halls with our new colleagues, and visit our customers. ", "I continue to be impressed by the caliber of people I meet, the innovative technologies being developed, and the passion the team has for using science to make a real difference in the world. It\u2019s also very clear to me that the life science solutions team shares our commitment to unrivaled industry leadership, and that\u2019s an important common denominator. ", "On the topic of integration, I\u2019m very pleased to report that our teams are implementing their plans and executing extremely well. We had a number of months to plan the integration so the team would be able to hit the ground running immediately after the close. As you know, we have a great track record of integrating acquisitions and achieving the synergies that we signed up for. We\u2019ve targeted $85 million of synergies in 2014 from the Life Technologies transaction and have no doubt that we\u2019ll accomplish that goal. ", "In late March, we completed the sale of the delayed divestitures that we previously announced to GE, and we received over $1 billion for our cell culture sera and media, gene modulation, and magnetic beads businesses. We were pleased to be able to complete the transaction expeditiously. The proceeds provide us with more cash to pay down our debt, and we still expect to achieve our target leverage during the third quarter of 2015, as we said on our Q4 call. ", "Last, but very important, our teams remain intensely focused on our customers and they executed very well to deliver solid financial results in Q1. We leveraged our top line growth and focused on controlling costs to once again continue our long trend of delivering outstanding adjusted EPS performance. ", "I\u2019ll now cover the financial highlights, give some commentary on end markets, hit some of the business achievements, and end with our guidance. As you saw in our press release, our results in Q1 include Life Technologies since early February and exclude the divestitures as of late March. ", "That said, our total revenue for the quarter grew 22% year over year. Adjusted operating income was $830 million in the quarter, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 200 basis points to 21.3%. The addition of Life Technologies businesses and our solid operational execution resulted in adjusted EPS performance of $1.53 per share. This was a 12% increase over 2013, and sets us up to deliver another year of consistently strong adjusted EPS growth.", "As you know, we use our PPI business system to continuously drive margin expansion and significant productivity across our global operations. In a market where we\u2019re still seeing some muted growth in certain customer segments, this is a key competitive advantage.", "One quick anecdote on this topic. Our laboratory equipment center of excellence in Ashville, North Carolina was recently recognized as one of the best plants in the U.S. by Industry Week magazine. I visited the plant in March to congratulate the team for the great work they\u2019ve done to achieve this distinction. ", "This was actually the second time one of our factories has won this award. Both plants have aggressively implemented the PPI business system across our operations and both are great examples of the impact that PPI can have.", "Our PPI business system is already being implemented at our new sites within life science solutions and we\u2019ll begin to see the results, which we\u2019ll highlight for you at our analyst meeting next month.", "Now, let me give you my perspective on our performance in the context of our four key end markets. I\u2019ll start by saying that in aggregate, our outlook for the year hasn\u2019t changed. So, beginning with academic and government, this end market started off in Q1 a little softer than what we had experienced over the past year or so, most likely due to some of our U.S. customers working fewer days.", "Overall, we said last quarter that these customers would probably begin spending money under the new appropriations at around midyear. Our view on that hasn\u2019t changed, and we believe this end market will improve in the second half as the funds begin to flow.", "Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, our performance her was relatively flat overall, reflecting the lower healthcare utilization in the U.S. that\u2019s been widely publicized. On the other hand, we had very good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses. As the year plays out and utilization increases, we expect growth for the full year to be in line with the company average.", "In industrial and applied, we delivered mid-single digit growth as conditions here continue to improve. You may recall that last quarter we said we believed the industrial market had begun to stabilize. To provide you with a little more color from a product perspective, we\u2019re pleased with our ongoing strength in chromatography, and we saw a nice pickup during the quarter in our portable analyzer business.", "Last, in pharma and biotech, we delivered high single-digit growth in the quarter, driven by continued strength in our clinical trials logistics and mass spectrometry businesses. It\u2019s clearly that our biopharma customers continue to recognize the benefits of our unique value proposition.", "So, in summary, as I mentioned at the beginning of my commentary, in aggregate, our outlook for the full year is consistent with our original guidance. Let me now talk about the great progress we\u2019re making strengthening our company to gain market share.", "As you know, we have a solid strategy for increasing share gain with our customers to drive growth. It\u2019s based on three core elements, technology innovation, our unique customer value proposition, and our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets.", "We\u2019ve followed this playbook for a number of years. It\u2019s served us well, and the acquisition of Life Technologies further enhances all three elements of our strategy. My point today is that we\u2019ll continue to execute this strategy to best serve our customers and strengthen our position as the unrivaled industry leader.", "In that context, let me cover some of the business highlights from the quarter. First, we kicked off the year with a lot of new products that strengthened our position as the innovation leader in our industry. Starting with Pittcon, the leading analytical instruments show, our theme this year was around helping customers run their laboratory operations more efficiently, regardless of the industry they were in.", "Our new[unintelligible] scientific products included instrument software, data management systems, and new additions from molecular spectroscopy and lab product offerings. To highlight two of the new launches, we released another update of our gold standard chromatography data system, Chromeleon 7.2. ", "This new version allows customers to control their mass spec instruments on a single data platform with gas, ion, and liquid chromatography instruments. We have good momentum in our chromatography and mass spec businesses and this industry leading software package is another step in further strengthening our competitive position.", "I also want to mention a small but innovative new product, the Virtuoso system for vial identification. This system prints barcodes directly on even the smallest vials to provide a data trail that could prevent the loss of valuable samples. This is a growing problem, and you may have seen the news last week about thousands of vials containing the SARS virus that were lost in a prestigious European research lab.", "At Analytica, we launched a number of new Thermo Scientific products that can help our laboratory and biotech customers improve productivity. Highlights included a new cell culture surface that better models cancer cell growth to accelerate research. We also introduced new systems for protecting individual samples during long term storage.", "Separately, we launched the Life Technologies Quantifiler Trio and HP kits for more accurate forensic analysis of highly compromised samples. Q1 also marked the launch of Ion Chef, which is used to automatically prepare DNA samples before they\u2019re loaded into the Ion Torrent gene sequencer.", "The key advantages of this new product are that it saves time for researchers and also reduces variability during the process to improve results. We shipped a significant number of our units to our customer base in the quarter, and early feedback is very positive.", "Let me now turn to our customer value proposition and give you an example from the quarter that shows how our increased [unintelligible] capabilities is a real differentiator for Thermo Fisher.", "We highlighted our expanded offering in bioreduction and bioprocessing at a leading biopharma manufacturing trade show called [unintelligible]. For the first time, our Thermo Scientific and Life Technologies offerings were displayed side by side in the booth. We launched several new single use technologies at the show to strengthen our leading position with this product offering.", "Customers could also see the embedded capabilities we now have in upstream cell culture applications, downstream [unintelligible], as well as analytics for detecting and quantifying impurities. This combination gives us a strong position with certain biopharma customers who are focused on bringing new biologics and vaccines to the market more quickly and cost effectively. ", "I\u2019ll make a couple of quick comments on Asia Pacific and emerging markets before wrapping up with our guidance. Let me start with China, where we recorded low double-digit growth during the quarter. We continue to have excellent momentum serving healthcare, although this is still a relatively small segment in China today. Our performance here was led by strong demand for a range of products in our specialty diagnostics businesses. ", "As you know, we continue to increase our presence across high growth regions. We delivered good growth in India, driven by strong sales of our analytical instruments, and the addition of Life Technologies builds on our leading presence across Asia Pacific. ", "In Southeast Asia, for example, we plan to further leverage the manufacturing infrastructure that we now have in Singapore. I\u2019m traveling to Asia shortly, and I look forward to visiting several of our sites and spending time with some of our key customers there. ", "So, I think this gives you a good sense of all the opportunities we have to drive growth and the great progress we\u2019re making in the three elements of our strategy. Turning now to our annual guidance, as you saw in our press release, we\u2019re raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. The increase primarily reflects the timing of the Life Technologies acquisition and related divestitures. It also reflects a slight improvement in foreign exchange rates versus our assumption at the beginning of the year.", "Pete will cover the details of our guidance in his remarks, but at a high level, we\u2019re raising our revenue guidance for 2014 to a new range of $16.84 billion to $17.0 billion for 29% to 30% revenue growth year over year. We are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $6.80 to $6.95, which would result in 25% to 28% adjusted EPS growth over our strong performance in 2013.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, we closed our acquisition of Life Technologies to further strengthen our strategic position. We had a very active quarter in terms of technology innovation, with many new product launches, and we continue to build on our scale to take advantage of the growth opportunities in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. We are clearly the unrivaled leader in our industry, and that puts us in an excellent position to continue to gain share.", "With that, now to you, Pete. ", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. I\u2019ll begin with an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company, then provide some color on each of our four segments and conclude with our updated 2014 guidance.", "Before I get into the details of our results, as we stated in our press release, our financial results for the quarter include Life Technologies as of February 4 and exclude the related divestitures as of March 22.", "As I mentioned last quarter, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we\u2019ll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition.", "However, for the life sciences solutions segment, which consists primarily of the Life Technologies businesses and our remaining biosciences businesses, we\u2019re providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014. We\u2019re doing this to give you insight into the growth performance of that segment.", "So, starting with our overall financial performance, we delivered a solid quarter, resulting in a 12% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.53. GAAP EPS was $1.36 in Q1, up 46% from $0.93 in Q1 2013, primarily as a result of the gain on the divestitures.", "Starting with the top line, Q1 total revenue increased 22% year over year and we delivered 2% organic growth. Q1 reported revenue includes 20% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and an immaterial positive impact from foreign exchange.", "We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings exceeding revenue by 2%. By geography, North America declined organically in the low single digits, Europe grow in the mid-single digits, and Asia Pacific grew in the high single-digits, with China growing low double-digits. The rest of the world grew in the low single digits. ", "Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 35% and adjusted operating margin was 21.3%, up 200 basis points from Q1 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the addition of Life Technologies, which had a higher overall margin rate compared to standalone Thermo Fisher.", "However, we also continued to see contribution from our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, site consolidations, and our PPI business system. In total, operating performance for standalone Thermo Fisher contributed about 30 basis points to adjusted operating margin expansion in the quarter.", "We realized benefits from our restructuring actions of $13 million in Q1 and are on track to achieve about $45 million of benefit for the full year. We also realized synergy benefits of $17 million in Q1, in line with our guidance of $85 million for full year 2014.", "In terms of supporting our growth initiatives, we continue to make strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our presence in emerging markets and continue our growth momentum in those regions.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, up 420 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the acquisition, along with solid productivity.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 23.1% of revenue, 140 basis points unfavorable to the 2013 quarter, again primarily as a result of the acquisition, partially offset by volume leverage and our productivity actions.", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 3.8% of revenue for the quarter, 70 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the relatively higher level of investment in R&D in the life sciences solution segment. R&D as a percentage of manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q1 was $106 million, up $49 million from last year, driven primarily by the debt we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q1 was $3 million, about the same level as Q1 last year. ", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 16%, 430 basis points above last year. This was primarily as a result of higher than average credits in the prior year, related to foreign tax credits and the double R&D tax credit, which has not yet been approved for this year.", "Although this quarter\u2019s rate is slightly above our full year adjusted tax rate guidance of 14.5% to 15.5%, this was assumed in our previous guidance, as we only included a partial quarter of benefit from the acquisition tax synergies in Q1. So we\u2019re maintaining our full year adjusted tax rate guidance and we expect that our adjusted tax rate will be below the Q1 rate for the balance of the year.", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $55 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 398.4 million in Q1, up 36.7 million, or 10% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition and to a much lesser degree, option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, there are a lot of moving pieces, primarily related to the acquisition and related divestitures. The headline numbers for Q1 are $102 million of cash flow from continuing operations and free cash flow of only $1 million after deducting $101 million of net capital expenditures. This compares to $236 million of free cash flow in the prior year.", "In the quarter, we incurred $240 million of one-time payments related to the acquisition close that were netted against operating cash flow, including financing fees, transaction fees, and restructuring costs. In our acquisition model, these outflows were primarily included as upfront deal costs.", "Cash flow from working capital in the quarter was reduced by about $50 million as a result of the close timing and related opening balance sheet amounts, and our tax payments were $115 million higher than the prior year, primarily because of the quarterly phasing of last year\u2019s payments. This will even out through the rest of the year.", "So, as I said, a lot of moving pieces this quarter. We ended the quarter with $1.52 billion in cash and investments, down $4.3 billion sequentially from Q4, as a result of funding the Life Technologies acquisition. ", "Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $17.4 billion, up $6.9 billion from Q4, as a result of drawing down our $5 billion term loan and issuing $500 million of commercial paper to fund the acquisition as well as assuming $2.3 billion of Life Technologies debt. ", "Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was about $1 billion higher than we need to maintain on an ongoing basis, because the divestiture proceeds were received very late in Q1. These proceeds were used to pay down debt early in Q2.", "Let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the first quarter of 2014 was 9.5%, down 60 basis points from Q4, as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition. As we normally do, we\u2019ll give you a longer term view of ROIC at our analyst meeting on May 20.", "So, with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the new life sciences solution segment, in Q1, total revenue grew significantly to $836 million from $173 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both the current and prior years, organic revenue grew 1%. ", "In the quarter, we saw good growth in our bioprocess production business and in next gen sequencing, partially offset by a tough comparison in licensing revenues. Q1 adjusted operating income for life sciences solutions also increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition, with adjusted operating margin of 550 basis points to 29.3%.", "Because of the timing of the acquisition close, life sciences solutions Q1 reported results include only February and March, which historically have higher margin than January, as a result of the phasing of revenue versus expenses throughout the quarter. As a result, we expect adjusted operating margin in the segment to be about 250 to 300 basis points lower in Q2 compared to Q1, but this should increase throughout the year as revenue and synergies increase.", "In the analytical instruments segment, in Q1 total revenue and organic revenue both grew 4%. In the quarter, we had very strong growth in our life sciences mass spec and chromatography businesses, which benefited from good performance in Europe and Asia Pac.", "Q1 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 17%, up 70 basis points. The margin expansion was driven by strong pull through on top line growth and good contribution from productivity actions, partially offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Turning to the specialty diagnostics segment, in Q1 total revenue grew 1% and organic growth was modestly positive. In the quarter, we continued to deliver good growth in our transplant diagnostics business and our immunodiagnostics business grew in the mid-single digits. As Marc noted earlier, we believe this was more than offset by weak healthcare utilization in the U.S. ", "Adjusted operating income in the segment declined 1% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 27.2%, down 50 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we delivered good productivity, but this was more than offset by strategic growth investments and some unfavorable mix.", "In the laboratory products and services segment, both reported revenue and organic revenue grew 2% in Q1. Our clinical trials logistics business continued to deliver very strong growth, but softness in the U.S. academic and government end market, as Marc mentioned, continued to be a headwind in this segment.", "Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 1% for the quarter, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 10 basis points as good productivity was more than offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable foreign exchange.", "So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our full year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, on the top line, we\u2019re raising both the low and high end of our reported revenue range, primarily as a result of the acquisition and divestiture timing as well as more favorable foreign exchange. This leads to a new full year 2014 revenue guidance range of $16.84 billion to $17.0 billion, which represents growth of 29% to 30% compared to our reported revenue of $13.1 billion in 2013. ", "To bridge the $190 million revenue increase from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we picked up $120 million related to the acquisition, primarily as a result of an early close date than our previous assumption, $45 million as a result of more favorable FX rates on Thermo Fisher standalone, and $25 million as a result of the divestitures closing later than our previous assumption.", "On an organic basis, we\u2019re still guiding to standalone organic growth for full year 2014 of 3% to 4%, consistent with our previous guidance. As I mentioned earlier, this measure of organic growth does not include the results of Life Technologies. For the life sciences solution segment, we still expect 2% to 3% pro forma organic growth for full year 2014, also consistent with our previous guidance.", "In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year over year foreign currency impact on our revenue will now be slightly positive. However, we\u2019re still expecting a slightly unfavorable margin impact resulting from the mix of currencies, with the stronger euro and British pound offsetting the weaker Japanese yen, which pulls through at a much higher rate. ", "The Life Technologies acquisition, net of related divestitures, is expected to contribute about 26 percentage points of our total revenue growth in 2014, and consistent with past practice, we haven\u2019t attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Moving to adjusted EPS, we\u2019re also raising both the low and high end of the range, in line with the change in our revenue guidance. This results in new full year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.80 to $6.95, which represents growth of 25% to 28% over our 2013 adjusted EPS of $5.42.", "To bridge the roughly $0.08 increase in adjusted EPS from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we added about $0.10 from the acquisition net of divestitures and about $0.02 from more favorable FX, which was partially offset by increased investments and some segment mix.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re maintaining our previous guidance for the full year of 220 basis points to 250 basis points of expansion. We continue to expect solid contribution from our productivity actions and about $85 million of synergy benefit in 2014 from the Life Technologies acquisition.", "Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $430 million to $440 million, up $10 million from our previous guidance. This is driven by the timing of the acquisition and divestiture close dates. Q2 interest expense will increase by about $10 million from Q1, as a result of having a full quarter of outstanding debt and then it will decrease throughout the year as we use our cash flow to pay down debt.", "As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5%, consistent with our previous guidance, and we\u2019re still assuming that we\u2019ll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders, all in the form of dividends, and that in addition to the proceeds of the divestitures, we\u2019ll use the bulk of our free cash flow to pay down short term debt.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 405 million, up 10% to 11% from 2013, and similar to interest expense, our share count will increase by about 4 million shares in Q2 compared to Q1, as a result of having the acquisition related shares outstanding for the full quarter. ", "We\u2019re still expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of 470 million to 490 million, and in terms of free cash flow, nothing has changed in our assumptions as to our year-end cash balance or the speed at which we expect to pay down our outstanding debt. However, solely as a result of the reporting of acquisition and divestiture related cash flows, we now expect reported full year free cash flow to be about $2.2 billion, which is below our previous guidance of $2.55 billion to $2.65 billion.", "One final note on guidance, we don\u2019t normally provide detail other than annual guidance, but similar to last quarter, there are a lot of moving parts related to the acquisition and divestitures in our Q1 results, so I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight into what we\u2019re expecting for Q2.", "In terms of revenue, we\u2019re expecting Q2 to represent about 25% of our full year revenue guidance, and in terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting Q2 as a percentage of our full year guidance to represent a couple points less than the comparable revenue percentage as a result of the acquisition synergies and revenue building throughout the year. ", "As always, in interpreting our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the year.", "In summary, we completed a number of significant milestones this quarter, while delivering solid operational results, which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken. ", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Thanks, Pete. Operator, we\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Jon Groberg of Macquarie.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital ", "I guess the first question is, North America now is going to be a slightly larger part of your revenues given life and obviously still a bit weaker. You talked about government and academic, healthcare utilization, but could you maybe give us a little bit more detail by segment what you\u2019re seeing in North America and maybe how you see that playing out throughout the remainder of the year?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of North America, in aggregate, things were fairly similar to what we\u2019ve seen over the last year or two, with two exceptions. Healthcare utilization is typically at your peak in Q4, and at your trough, or lowest level of utilization, in Q1. So that\u2019s a pattern that started in 2013 and continues to be even a little bit more dramatic as you get to 2014. So you have that dynamic, and we expect that that improves as the year unfolds.", "From an academic and government perspective, the appropriations is a positive, and as we said on our original call in February, we expect funds to flow from the appropriations to happen in the second half of the year, which is kind of customary in terms of how that works. Clearly, as we\u2019ve talked to a number of our customers, they worked fewer days in the early part of the year, and that had some effect on our industry in terms of consumable demand, and that should obviously be just a one-time factor that will not repeat as the year goes on.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital ", "And what were some of the implied markets, or some of the more industrial markets in North America?", "Marc Casper ", "From a North America perspective, no really big changes. Industrial and applied continues to strengthen, and pharma and biotech continues to be an area of strength for the company. So those are clearly positives.", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital ", "You mentioned Interphex, and obviously I was there and looking at the opportunities with your bag business and [Gibco]. And obviously, the more you dig into this, it looks like there\u2019s a lot of opportunity from a revenue synergy standpoint. I know it\u2019s not something you\u2019ve talked about as much in the investment community, because it\u2019s harder to get credit for it, but maybe now that you\u2019ve met with people, you\u2019re travelling around, you\u2019re examining opportunities, you\u2019re going over to Asia, I\u2019m just curious, from a revenue synergy opportunity, how are you thinking about the acquisition with Life relative to maybe where you were six months or so ago?", "Marc Casper ", "From our perspective, we\u2019re very excited about the logic of the combination and the revenue synergies that we\u2019re going to capture over time. In fact, that will be one of the themes that we cover at our analyst day. Mark Stevens will walk through some of the things that we\u2019re working towards. Not going to have a big impact in 2014. We\u2019ve assumed that there won\u2019t be any revenue synergies this year, although I assume we\u2019ll deliver something in the later half that\u2019s small. But they really ramp up in \u201915 and beyond.", "In the area of the one that you actually saw yourself, in Interphex, we didn\u2019t assume a lot of revenue synergies, because we\u2019re doing a divestiture and so forth, but it\u2019s a great combination of having the single use technologies from our Thermo Scientific brand being combined with the Life Technologies position in the media sera as well as the downstream analytics.", "So that combination should actually be quite powerful, and over time should put us in the position to gain significant share in that market segment. Other areas of revenue synergy, clearly our ecommerce capabilities are strengthened by the combination, great strength in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and good opportunities to leverage our complementary channel strength, both our Fisher Scientific channel as well as the strength that Life Technologies brings to the company. So, lots of opportunities for the company to capture revenue synergies.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ross Muken with ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "I guess on the core growth number for the quarter, how did it sort of pace relative to your expectations as the quarter went on and relative to your view coming in? And how do we put in context the book-to-bill, which is not a metric we look at for you guys that often, as it\u2019s usually around one, but it was sort of particularly robust this quarter. How do we put all of that in context?", "Marc Casper ", "When we looked at our original growth outlook for the year in our guidance call at the beginning of the year, we looked at 3% to 4% organic growth for Thermo Fisher and 2% to 3% for the life sciences solutions segment. The Q1 performance, nothing has changed in terms of our expectation for the full year. We\u2019re very confident in our ability to achieve both of those milestones.", "When I look at the first quarter, and the question around phasing, January and February were softer than normal. March was a strengthening and obviously bookings also were much better than revenue, and that\u2019s really driven by just the timing, as customers got back to work later in the quarter. We had good bookings momentum, which gives us confidence as we continue through the year to achieve our organic growth goals.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "I guess just relative to growth in China, we had run at 20% for a long time. It came down to kind of mid upper teens, and now we\u2019re kind of in the low double-digits. As you think about that geography going forward, obviously the PMIs haven\u2019t been great. It seems like the healthcare piece is quite healthy, the industrial is a lot more mixed. Any sort of pacing there or change there in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that as a growth contributor, maybe on a near versus longer term basis?", "Marc Casper ", "You know, I\u2019m actually heading off to China next week. My view is a couple of things. One, we continue to have a very strong position. We delivered good growth, albeit a little bit slower than we have delivered over the last couple of years. Healthcare is very strong, and that\u2019s been a continuing trend. And I agree, kind of industrial is a bit mixed. I\u2019ll spend more time with the team. Basically, nothing has changed with the long term outlook in terms of our view on China. We still believe it\u2019s going to be in the range of mid-teens as the year progresses.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "And one quick one for Pete. Did you call out the actually dollar contribution in the quarter? I know you gave us a net number. Are you going to be providing that so we can kind of back in?", "Peter Wilver ", "What I said is the operating performance of Thermo Fisher standalone was about 30 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter. So that\u2019s really the number to look at. ", "Ross Muken - ISI Group ", "I\u2019m sorry, on a revenue basis. The revenue dollars.", "Peter Wilver ", "Off the top of my head, I don\u2019t know the number. I believe it\u2019s in my script.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan ", "First question, just on the pharma channel. It\u2019s obviously been a busy week in M&A world for pharma and healthcare in general. Could you maybe just talk about your view on the trajectory? I know you previously guided for a deceleration in the pharma business, but what\u2019s your latest thinking as we think about all the potential M&A here?", "Marc Casper ", "The first thing is another very strong quarter of performance in our biopharma customer set. A little bit stronger than the full year guidance that we gave in February, so the team executed well. Obviously a lot of corporate repositioning announced over the last 24 or 48 hours, with our customer set. And I think as companies look for synergies, we typically gain share. They have targets, we have incredibly strong relationships with the executive team, and we bring them ideas on how they can get higher impact for their dollars of spend. And in fact, two of the CEOs that were involved in those repositionings, and I already communicated about some opportunities, so we have very strong real time relationships with these customers.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan ", "And then as we think about the integration initiatives, obviously you\u2019ve highlighted PPI for your own business, can you just talk maybe about how easy it is to port over that process to the life business and other kind of big next steps? I guess you\u2019ll get into a lot of this at the analyst day, but how do we think about applying PPI to the underlying life business?", "Marc Casper ", "Even though we\u2019ve only owned the business for a couple of months, the reality is they\u2019re already starting to use our business processes, so in terms of how we operate our business. And we already have our PPI methodology being implemented. And we\u2019ll highlight some of the impacts of that, but that\u2019s something that we start right at the beginning, and start with the training, start with the impact, and it\u2019s part of the synergies that we deliver, and it\u2019s part of the ongoing productivity that we\u2019ll be able to drive for that business and certainly improve our customer experience, which positions us to accelerate growth and gain share.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan ", "Pete, can you quantify the weather impact? It\u2019s a tricky thing, I\u2019m sure, but I\u2019m just wondering if you\u2019ve got a number you can throw out.", "Peter Wilver ", "Yeah, it\u2019s obviously not an exact science, but when we look at the weather impact, as well as the impact of seasonal products, both flu and pollen were down versus the prior year, it\u2019s about a 1 percentage point impact on the quarter. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "I\u2019m getting some questions from people on the second quarter guidance, the trajectory there. I assume the midpoint of that is a little bit lower than the Street number for the EPS number, if you sort of use your math. I assume that\u2019s just all related to the timing of synergies and when things are coming through. Could you talk about your plans in terms of how you\u2019re looking at synergies and what the different phases are with that?", "Marc Casper ", "Just one thing to keep in mind, in terms of Q2, we always have a seasonal impact in Q2, because that\u2019s when we do salary increases. So that has an impact on the bottom line, and that\u2019s true for Life Technologies as well. So that could be one of the differences.", "In terms of the synergies, we obviously realize $17 million in Q1 already. Those were the duplicative public company costs that we were able to eliminate, pretty much on day one. And then as we go through the year, we\u2019re continuing to eliminate duplicative corporate costs, for corporate functions, and we\u2019re beginning to integrate the biosciences business, the businesses, legacy Thermo Fisher, that were combined into Life Technologies to create Life Sciences Solutions. So those will build throughout the year.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ", "Has there been anything that sort of stuck out in Life in terms of when you got under the hood and looked for potential revenue surprises in the sense of more opportunity to develop new products, more potential downstream synergies in terms of revenue potential for the company, new product investments? I\u2019m just curious in terms of how you\u2019re thinking about the business now that you\u2019ve got your hands on it.", "Marc Casper ", "As we\u2019ve thought over the last couple of months, part of the activity is for myself and other members of the team just to get visibility to our new colleagues, visit customers jointly and really look at the opportunities. ", "And one of the things that, to me, has been a real highlight is I spent quite a bit of time meeting with some of our new scientists - not new to the company, but new to Thermo Fisher - and they\u2019re working on great technologies. So we\u2019re bringing a really complementary suite of technologies and we\u2019re already brainstorming long term on what are the new solutions that we can bring out from combining the two companies\u2019 suites of technology capabilities. So long term, I\u2019m very excited about what both companies bring.", "From a customer perspective, feedback is incredibly positive. They see great synergy between the company, and the positions us the opportunity to gain share. So no surprises, but it\u2019s been very positive and the business is performing as we expected, so we\u2019re off to a good start.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company ", "Is there anything you could share regarding the changes in allocation of investment at Life Technologies product pipeline or commercial infrastructure you have implemented or are implementing since the deal closed?", "Marc Casper ", "From my perspective, what we do from an innovation perspective is make sure that we\u2019re maximizing the impact of our investment. Innovation is a core part of our strategy, and that\u2019s part of the reason we\u2019re meeting with our scientific leaders and scientists, just to really get an understanding of what\u2019s in the pipeline. It\u2019s business as usual right now, which is teams are working on great things, and they\u2019re doing a great job, and that\u2019s what they\u2019re focused on. And then certainly we\u2019re looking for what are the new opportunities that the combined company has going as we get later into the year and into 2015. So it\u2019s a very exciting time from a scientific and innovation perspective.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company ", "With One Lambda and Life under Thermo, can you just talk about the development efforts of sequence based HLA typing? This is a rapidly growing market and a lot of your biggest competitors announced earlier this year that they will be making a push into this market. So how are you thinking about competitive dynamics and the HLA sequencing market size? ", "Marc Casper ", "In terms of our transplant diagnostics business, it\u2019s doing really well. It\u2019s been a great acquisition, growing well above what the acquisition model assumed in 2012, so I feel great about that. We have integrated the HLA capabilities from a sequencing perspective, that Life Technologies brought to Thermo Fisher, into that business already. So that\u2019s a combined offering that we\u2019re working on, and we feel good about our prospects in that area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. ", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research", "I was wondering if you could provide a little more color as it relates to the growth rates within the life science solutions segment, specifically if you strip out the standalone or existing Thermo business, what did that grow versus what did the Life Technologies business grow? And then my second thing was just on the analytical instruments business. I heard you said that mass spec and chromatography both saw strong growth. I was just wondering if you could talk about the remaining pace of that business and what the trends are with those products.", "Marc Casper ", "In terms of the analytical instruments business, what else is in there is a lot of our industrial chemical analysis businesses. So you obviously have great strength in chrom and mass spec, you still have some weakness in the later cycle, longer lead time products. So that would be what you see there. I was encouraged in the quarter by the strengthening in our portable instruments business. That\u2019s kind of the shorter cycle industrial business, so that saw a nice pickup in the quarter. So there\u2019s some signs of a continued economic recovery in the industrial markets.", "From the life sciences solutions perspective, we\u2019re already integrating that business, so we\u2019re thinking about that as one unified business as we put our biosciences business in there. The growth rates were pretty similar between what would have been legacy Thermo Fisher products and what was the Life Technologies products. So they both grew around the same rate, in aggregate. So that\u2019s the view on the splits there. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Tim Evans from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities ", "Just to follow up there on the question from Steve, in the life science solutions business, could you maybe give us a little bit more commentary around the clinical end markets that that business serves, particularly in molecular diagnostics products or the products going into that market?", "Marc Casper ", "Maybe give a little bit more color in aggregate on the life sciences solutions segment, just to frame it, and I\u2019ll cover clinical as well in that. So when I look at the performance of the business and the outlook, first of all, we feel confident about the 2% to 3% growth organically this year. ", "Within life science solutions, you really have three main businesses: bioproduction, which is our fastest growing portion of the portfolio; biosciences, which is our market leading position in our high tech bioscience reagents; and you have genetic sciences, which is made up of our QPCR franchise; our applied markets, such as human identification. You have animal and food testing as well. You have our next gen sequencing business, as well as our Sanger sequencing franchise. ", "Within the next gen sequencing businesses, you actually have a nice clinical presence as well, as there\u2019s adoption of both those technologies there. And we continue to have good momentum in that part of our portfolio.", "In terms of highlights, as I thought about it for the quarter, what I would say is I was very encouraged to see that QPCR had a good quarter in terms of growth. We have really nice momentum in next gen sequencing. So I think that\u2019s a really nice complement to how the life science solutions team has started off the year.", "Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities ", "Given those dynamics, though, and the 1% growth, the headwind from the licensing and maybe some other pieces of the business, that must have been fairly significant.", "Marc Casper ", "Yeah, so headwinds, the OEM licensing royalties were all headwinds versus what was a strong Q1 of 2013. We saw some headwinds in portions of our Sanger sequencing business as we\u2019ll. So those would be the headwinds that we would have seen in Q1.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. ", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs ", "Pete, just wondering if you could put a little color on the pricing environment this quarter and your expectations for the year in the context of your core growth guidance?", "Peter Wilver ", "In the quarter we did realize positive price, but it was between zero and 50 basis points, so pretty much consistent with what we\u2019ve seen for the last every quarter in the prior year, so slightly positive. That\u2019s basically what we\u2019re assuming for the full year, around 25 basis points.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs ", "And then a follow up to the earlier question on pharma, the M&A activity there. If we were to compare the share gains that you typically get in these types of opportunities, against the overarching cuts that you typically see in the combined R&D budgets for those accounts, is it fair to say the net effect of those two forces is typically a positive for your business in those accounts?", "Marc Casper ", "As we\u2019ve said in years past, typically you get a little bit of a dampener as companies are figuring out exactly what they\u2019re going to be doing. But we typically then gain share, because we\u2019re part of their synergy program and they typically move spend to us as part of that process, and it nets out to be, over time, a positive for Thermo Fisher. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Capital.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital ", "Marc, you had mentioned the handheld market, and that kind of a leading indicator for these applied markets improving. Have you been surprised how slow it\u2019s taken the industrial market to improve?", "Marc Casper ", "I\u2019m not surprised. We\u2019re in this new normal of more slow recovery, economically globally. And so we\u2019re seeing the improvements now in our shorter cycle business and that\u2019s good news. And then at least we have stabilization in the longer lead time businesses. So we didn\u2019t come out of the last recession with a big springback in terms of growth, but it\u2019s something that we assumed, and we\u2019re managing through, which is why the use of PPI and managing our costs effectively positions the company so well. We\u2019ve been able to deliver great earnings growth in a muted top line environment, and we feel like we\u2019re very well-positioned to capitalize on the opportunities that are out there.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital ", "And specifically, the [unintelligible] analyzer, probably in the metals mining market, you\u2019re seeing, I guess, stability there? ", "Marc Casper ", "Yeah, we\u2019re seeing growth again in our handhelds, which is a good leading indicator for us.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital ", "And then you [cite], in mass spectrometry, I think that must be what, stable pharma and biotechnology capital going into that market? ", "Marc Casper ", "Those two are good drivers, plus really great products. Our products are just being adopted, so from our perspective, we have a really exciting pipeline of demand for what we launched at ASMS last year, and we\u2019re looking forward to ASMS coming up again later in the spring, and a new suite of products as well. ", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird", "I guess just a followon to Paul\u2019s question. Can you give a little more color on where you\u2019re seeing the growth in MS and chromatography, and perhaps an update on the competitive environment?", "Marc Casper ", "Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid is doing great. High end research, academic, biopharma, extremely strong adoption. So that\u2019s been a very positive driver. From a chromatography perspective, applied markets, industrial markets, have been good for chromatography. We have strength in liquid chromatography, we have strength in [IM] chromatography in the quarter, and feel like we\u2019re well-positioned there. So those are two businesses that had very good growth in the quarter. ", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird ", "And a follow up on China. Can you give a little more color on some of the growth rates you\u2019re seeing in other areas there, like some of the more applied areas, environment and whatnot?", "Marc Casper ", "I would say industrial and applied, not dramatic changes from what we\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters. We saw a little bit of a slowness in the release of funds from government customers in China, and that happens from time to time. That seemed to be a factor that played out a little bit in the quarter.", "Operator", "Our final question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies ", "Pete, on the free cash flow revision, could you elaborate on the moving parts that are contemplated in the new outlook relative to the prior view?", "Peter Wilver ", "As I said, nothing has really changed in the operational side of our free cash flow guidance. But as I said, there\u2019s lots of moving pieces, just in the way that acquisitions and divestitures are reported. As I said, in Q1, we had about $240 million of payments related to the acquisition that hit free cash flow, $50 million of working capital impact. ", "And then just to give another example that we\u2019ll experience later in the year, the gross proceeds of the divestitures are excluded from free cash flow, but in fact the tax payments that we\u2019ll make are actually included in free cash flow. So in that case, nothing\u2019s changed in our assumption that we\u2019re going to get somewhere around $800 million net from the divestitures, but reported cash flow will take a hit of over $200 million as a result of that. ", "So the change is in the range of $400 million. Again, nothing operational. It doesn\u2019t change our year-end cash balance forecast or how fast we think we\u2019re going to pay down debt. It\u2019s just simply the moving pieces of how the acquisition and divestitures are reported. ", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies ", "And then Marc, you spoke to the government and academic markets in the U.S., but curious what your view would be for that end market in the European and Asian geographies.", "Marc Casper ", "Generally, Europe, in its entirety, continues to be consistent. We had mid-single digit growth in the quarter, continuing to benefit from stability. And that\u2019s been a positive. There\u2019s been some exciting R&D initiatives that are government funded that bode well for long term European demand. So I feel good about that. I don\u2019t think we mentioned this as much, but we had good position and good strength in Japan in the quarter. There\u2019s some initiatives around a tax increase that went into effect April 1 that encouraged customers to spend some money. So that\u2019s off to a good start as well. So that\u2019s a quick view on academic and government around the world. ", "Let me wrap it up with just a couple of quick comments. As I think back on the quarter, we made significant progress in Q1. I think we delivered solid results and positioned ourselves well to deliver another strong year. Thanks for the support of Thermo Fisher Scientific and certainly we look forward to updating you next quarter. Thanks, everyone.

[Operator Instructions] I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until August 22, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 second quarter earnings and future expectations is available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 29, 2014, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2014 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Ken, thanks and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s Q2 call. I am very pleased to report that we had an excellent quarter with strong performance on both the top and bottom line. Our teams executed very well and we are seeing the results of our growth strategy. And we continue to build on our industry leadership with investments in technology innovation and global capabilities. ", "We have a lot of great news to cover this morning but I\u2019ll start by reminding you that our primary financial objective is to consistently deliver strong adjusted EPS growth. And by that measure we had an outstanding Q2. Our strong revenue performance, our culture of constantly driving productivity and great execution on the Life Technologies integration extended our long track record of EPS growth. ", "With a solid first half behind us, we are in excellent position to deliver on our growth goals for the year. So let me turn to our Q2 financial results, then discuss our performance in the context of our end markets and geographies. I\u2019ll hit some of the business highlights and then wrap up with our guidance. ", "I want to remind you that Q2 is the first full quarter, including Life Technologies, which is reported in our Life Sciences Solutions segment. As you saw in our press release, our total revenue for the quarter grew 33% year over year. Adjusted operating income was $924 million in the quarter and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 210 basis points to 21.4%. ", "As I said, we had very strong performance on the bottom line, delivering adjusted EPS of $1.72, which was a 30% increase over last year. I am really pleased with how our teams executed in the quarter, leveraging our PPI business system to translate our strong revenue performance into outstanding earnings growth. So it was an excellent quarter overall and contributed to our first half that played out better than we expected. ", "Let me take a couple of minutes to give you my perspective on our performance in the context of our four key end markets. I\u2019ll start by saying that our growth outlook for the full-year has improved slightly and that's because our performance in pharma and biotech in the first half of the year was a bit stronger than we expected. Aside from that, in aggregate we didn\u2019t see any significant changes in our other end markets that would alter our view for the balance of the year.", "So starting with pharma and biotech. As I mentioned, the end market continues to be a terrific story. Our teams are performing very well. They\u2019re doing a great job of delivering our customer value proposition and this resulted in another quarter of high single-digit growth. We saw strength in the quarter in pharma and biotech across our analytical instruments, lab equipment and consumables and our biopharma services business also continues to perform very well. ", "In the academic and government end market, we saw improvement in Q2 with growth in the low single digits. We said last quarter that we thought funds would begin to flow in the U.S. under the new appropriations. And that seems to be playing out. Stronger results in North America during the quarter were offset partially by weakness in China which I\u2019ll discuss in a minute. ", "In industrial and applied, we delivered low single digit growth again this quarter and haven't really seen any meaningful changes here since the beginning of the year. ", "Last, in diagnostics and healthcare, we performed very well growing in the mid-single digits in Q2. Strength in the U.S. drove our results here and sales of our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostic products remained strong. So a great Q2 offset a slower Q1 resulting in a first half that was generally in line with our original expectations in this end market. ", "To sum up our performance overall, stronger results in pharma and biotech led to a first half that played out a bit better than we expected. As a result, we\u2019ve slightly increased our growth outlook for the full-year. ", "Before I move on to the business highlights, let me make a few brief remarks about our results in key geographies. First, we performed very well in North America in Q2. As I mentioned in the context of our end markets, it\u2019s especially nice to see some renewed strength in the U.S. ", "We also had a very good quarter in Europe with strength in our biopharma services, analytical instruments and immunodiagnostics businesses. As you saw in the press release, we\u2019re expanding our centers of excellence in Lithuania and Germany to support growth in our molecular biology and mass spectrometry products. ", "In China, while we had good growth in Q1, revenue performance in Q2 was flat, and this was driven by a slower release of government funds. That said, we remain confident in our growth prospects for China and recorded bookings growth in the high teens in Q2. ", "So to sum up our performance geographically as you know, China has historically delivered very strong growth. And in spite of the results we saw there in Q2, I am pleased that we\u2019re able to deliver strong revenue growth for the company overall. ", "Let me shift now to highlight the great progress we\u2019re making to strengthen our leadership position, so we can best serve our customers and gain market share. As you know, we have a solid strategy for driving growth. It\u2019s based on technology innovation, our unique customer value proposition and our scale in APAC and emerging markets. ", "It was an excellent quarter in terms of innovation, so I\u2019ll focus my remarks there this morning. We had a number of new products that demonstrate our ongoing commitment to technology innovation. As you know, the American Society for Mass Spectrometry Conference or ASMS is always an important forum for Thermal Fisher. It's an opportunity to showcase our industry leadership and we took full advantage of that again this year. ", "At the show, we launched two significant new instruments, complementary software packages and new consumables that improved sample preparation. I\u2019ll start with the Q Exactive HF which was named ASMS product of the show by the industry publication Industry Business Outlook. The Q Exactive HF is an LC-MS system that builds on our highly successful Q Exactive platform by incorporating an ultra-high field Orbitrap massive analyser. It dramatically increases performance for research customers who continue to push for greater analytical speed and sensitivity to accelerate the results. The Q Exactive HF is especially suited to life-sciences applications such as protein identification and reinforces our leadership in Proteomics. ", "Application-specific software is critical to extending the use of mass spec and creating new market opportunities for us. We made significant inroads with biopharma customers by launching PepFinder 1.0 for Biotherapeutic protein characterization. We also launched Proteome Discoverer 2.0 which provides a wide range of bio-informatics tools and customizable workflows to accelerate protein research. ", "Let me give you a quick example of a significant milestone recently achieved by our customers at Mass General Hospital & Harvard Medical School because it illustrates the profound impact our thermo scientific technologies are having on protein research. ", "Using our most advanced mass spectrometry instruments along with our customized reagents, scientists there were able to carry out comprehensive proteome analyses of 32 breast cancer cell lines in just six days. This would have taken up to 10 times longer without the integrated combination of the technologies we provided. According to the researchers, this is the first time that proteome analysis was performed on a scale previously reserved for genomics. Their achievement marks a huge step forward in the scientific community and complements the sequencing of the human genome in 2001. ", "For customers working in applied markets, we expanded our successful TSQ 8000 triple quad offering by launching the TSQ 8000 Evo at ASMS. The system incorporates the new EvoCell technology to significantly increase productivity for customers analyzing food, environmental, pharmaceutical and forensic samples for complex compounds. It's a great example of us focusing on creating new opportunities in applied markets by giving our customers more sophisticated tools for non-targeted analysis. ", "I also want to mention that our GlobalFiler PCR amplification kit received approval from the FBI for use in forensics. FBI labs will use GlobalFiler to generate DNA profiles of suspects for national database that will be instrumental to helping solve crimes. ", "Before I turn to our guidance, let me give you a brief update on the Life Technologies integration. Our teams are making very good progress executing their plans and we're now tracking ahead of our original synergy target for the year. We now expect it to achieve 100 million in synergies 2014, up from the 85 million in synergies we originally anticipated. So we\u2019re pleased to report that we are achieving the first $100 million at a faster pace and we remain confident in our overall synergy target for year three which we increased from 300 million to 350 million at our analyst meeting back in May. ", "Turning now to our annual guidance. As you saw on our press release, we revised our revenue guidance and are raising our adjusted EPS guidance. This is based on our solid operating performance in the first half of the year and the increased synergies from the Life Technologies integration. ", "The new guidance also reflects the estimated impact of the divestiture of our Cole-Parmer business which we announced last week. We expect -- we signed an agreement to sell the specialty channel for $480 million and expect to complete the transaction in Q3. ", "So in terms of our guidance at this point in the year, we now expect our revenues for 2014 to be in the range of $16.86 billion to $16.98 billion for 29% to 30% revenue growth year-over-year as we previously announced. We\u2019re raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $6.85 to $6.97 which now results in 26% to 29% growth over 2013. ", "So before I turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few takeaways. First, it was an excellent quarter for us financially across-the-board, with strong performance in revenues, margins, adjusted EPS and cash flow. It\u2019s been a very strong year so far on the innovation front, and we look forward to more significant new product launches to come in the second half. ", "The Life Technologies integration is going very well and we increased our 2014 synergy expectations. So at this point in the year, we\u2019re on track to deliver a strong 2014. ", "With that, I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Peter Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Peter Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. As you can see from our results, we had a strong second quarter and delivered a solid first half. ", "Let me begin with an overview of our Q2 financial performance for the total company, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2014 guidance. ", "As a reminder, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we will exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition. However for the new life sciences solution segment, which consists primarily of the Life Technologies businesses and our remaining biosciences businesses, we are providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance for that segment. ", "So starting with our overall financial performance. We delivered strong earnings growth resulting in a 30% increase in adjusted EPS to $1.72. GAAP EPS was $0.69 in Q2, down 9% from $0.76 in the prior year, primarily as a result of higher non-cash cost of sales charges related to the acquisition accounting.", "Looking at the top line. We delivered 5% organic revenue growth this quarter and total revenue increased 33% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue includes 27 points of growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 1% positive impact from foreign exchange. We once again strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings exceeding revenue by 1%. ", "By geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid single digits. As Marc mentioned, China was flat year-over-year resulting in Asia Pacific growth in the low single digits. Our China bookings performance in the quarter was much stronger than revenue and was up in the high teens. As a result, we\u2019re confident that revenue growth in China will be much stronger in the second half resulting in high single-digit growth for the full-year. Rest of world declined in the low single digits. ", "Looking at our operational performance. Q2 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 21.4%, up 210 basis points from Q2 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the Life Technologies acquisition which as you know has a higher overall margin rate compared to standalone Thermo Fisher. ", "However we also continue to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. And for the first time in quite a while, we saw expansion from FX compared to the dilution we've been experiencing for the past couple of years. ", "We realized $23 million of synergy benefits in Q2 and $40 million through the first half. As Marc mentioned, we now expect to achieve $100 million of cost synergies for the full-year 2014, up from the $85 million we previously communicated. This is being driven primarily by accelerating corporate and functional cost reductions as well as modestly increased sourcing savings. ", "Our growth initiatives remain on track and we continue to make strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities to continue our growth momentum. ", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.0% in Q2, up 480 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the Life Technologies acquisition along with solid productivity across our businesses. ", "Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 23.4% of revenue, 140 basis points unfavorable to the 2013 quarter. Again this was primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage in our productivity actions. ", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.3% of revenue for the quarter, 130 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the relatively higher level of investment in R&D and life-sciences solution segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.6%. ", "Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q2 was $113 million, up $56 million from last year driven primarily by the deb we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q2 was $1 million, about the same level as last year. ", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.3%, 130 basis points below last year primarily as a result of our acquisition tax planning. Our year-to-date tax rate was 15.1% in line with our full-year outlook of 14.5% to 15.5%. ", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $60 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 403.1 million in Q2, up 39.6 million or 11% from last year primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, and to a much lesser degree option dilution. ", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was a very strong $992 million and free cash flow was $824 million after deducting $167 million of net capital expenditures. This is up significantly from our prior year free cash flow of $650 million primarily as a result of our increased operating earnings from the acquisition, partially offset by higher acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures which I highlighted on last quarter's call. ", "We ended the quarter with $600 million in cash and investments, down $900 million sequentially from Q1, as we used surplus cash on balance sheet as well as cash generated in the quarter to pay down short-term debt in Q2. As a result, our total debt at the end of Q2 was $15.6 billion, down $1.8 billion from Q1. ", "Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA and we remain on track to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times in Q3 of 2015. ", "So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with a quick update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the second quarter of 2014 was 9.3%, down 20 basis points from Q1 as expected, driven by the addition of another quarter of the Life Technologies investment \u2013 of adding another quarter of the Life technologies investment into the average invested capital base used in the calculation. This was partially offset by higher returns generated in the rest of the business. ", "So with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the life sciences solution segment, in Q2 total revenue grew significantly to $1.10 billion from $181 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of divestitures. ", "On a pro forma basis, assuming Life technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both periods, organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction business as well as in cell biology and next-generation sequencing, which was partially offset by lower royalties. ", "Q2 adjusted operating income for life sciences solution also increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition with adjusted operating margin up 310 basis points to 27.1%. ", "In the analytical instruments segment, Q2 total revenue grew 4% and organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we had very strong growth in our life sciences mass spec and instruments services businesses which was partially offset by the weakness in China that Marc mentioned. ", "Q2 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increase 4% and adjusted operating margin was 16.4%, down 10 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity and saw a positive contribution from FX that was more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic growth investments. ", "Turning to the specialty diagnostic segment, in Q2 total revenue grew 8% and organic growth was a very strong at 6%. As Marc said, we saw better market conditions in the U.S. versus the slow first quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth in our transplant diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses and our healthcare market channel had a very strong quarter as well. ", "Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 9% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had nice pull-through on the organic growth and strong productivity which funded strategic growth investments. ", "In the laboratory products and services segment, Q2 reported revenue grew 7% and organic revenue grew a robust 6%. Our biopharma services business continued to deliver very strong growth and we saw a broad-based strength across the rest of the business. This segment benefited from our strong performance in the biopharma end market as well as the pickup in our US academic and government end market. ", "Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 8% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, up 20 basis points driven by strong productivity and volume pull-through. ", "So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our full-year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re updating our guidance for our strong performance in the first half and to reflect the divestiture of our Cole Parmer business which we announced last week. ", "On the top line, we\u2019re tightening the range by 40 million resulting in a midpoint that's unchanged. This leads to a new full-year 2014 revenue guidance range of $16.86 billion to $16.98 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 29% to 30% consistent with our previous guidance. To bridge the pluses and minuses to the midpoint of our guidance, we added $80 million in volume, about 45 million of which was organic and another 10 million as a result of more favorable FX rates on the Thermo Fisher stand-alone businesses. These increases were fully offset by a $90 million decrease as a result of the Cole Parmer divestiture assuming a mid Q3 close date. ", "On an organic basis, we\u2019re still expecting standalone organic growth for full-year 2014 of 3% to 4% consistent with our previous guidance although we now expect to be somewhat higher in the range. As I mentioned earlier, this measure of organic growth does not include results of Life Technologies. ", "For the life sciences solutions segment, we still expect pro forma organic growth of 2% to 3% for the full-year 2014, also consistent with our previous guidance and slightly higher in the range. ", "In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year-over-year foreign-currency impact on our revenue remains slightly positive at about half a percent. In terms of margin pull-through on the FX revenue impact, we\u2019re expecting a slight improvement versus our previous guidance primarily as a result of our favorable Q2 results. ", "The Life technologies acquisition net of divestitures is expected to contribute about 26 percentage points of our total revenue growth in 2014, unchanged from our previous guidance. And consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures other than the Cole Parmer divestiture. ", "Moving to adjusted EPS, we\u2019re raising both the low and high end of the range in line with the change in revenue as well as increased contribution from acquisition synergies. This leads to a new full-year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.85 to $6.97 which now represents growth of 26% to 29% over our 2013 EPS of $5.42. To bridge the $0.04 increase in the adjusted EPS from the midpoint of our previous guidance, the acquisition including synergies is up about $0.04 and performance in standalone Thermo Fisher added about $0.03. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $0.03 related to the pending Cole Parmer divestiture, again assuming a mid Q3 close. ", "Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re increasing low end and tightening the range by 10 basis points. This results in a revised guidance of 21.8% to 22% of adjusted operating margin and 230 to 250 basis points of expansion year-over-year. ", "As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re also increasing the synergy benefits we expect to realize in 2014 to 100 million, up 15 million from our previous guidance. The increase in 2014 is driven by realizing some synergies a bit earlier than we had originally planned and therefore does not change the 350 million of total expected synergies by year three that we outlined at our analyst meeting. ", "Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of 425 million to 435 million, down slightly from our previous guidance as a result of paying down debt more quickly. As I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be in the range of 14.5% to 15.5% consistent with our previous guidance. ", "In terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re still assuming that we will return approximately 240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And we are also assuming that in the second half we\u2019ll use the bulk of our free cash flow and the net proceeds from the Cole Parmer divestiture of approximately 340 million to pay down short-term debt. ", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 404 million, up about 10% from 2013 and down slightly from our previous guidance. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of 460 million to 480 million, also down slightly from our previous guidance. ", "And in terms of full-year 2014 free cash flow, we\u2019re maintaining our previous guidance of about 2.2 billion and we expect that our year-end leverage will be slightly lower as a result of using the net proceeds from the Cole Parmer divestiture to pay down debt. ", "However we do have a headwind versus our previous guidance of over 150 million related to the Cole Parmer divestiture as a result of lost earnings and the cash taxes we expect to pay on the taxable gain. So we\u2019ll need to perform very well in the second half to achieve this forecast. ", "One final note on guidance. We recognize that it\u2019s still challenging to model the newly combined company. So I thought it\u2019d be helpful to give you some insight into what we\u2019re expecting for Q3. ", "In terms of revenue, we\u2019re expecting Q3 to represent about 25% of our full-year revenue guidance midpoint. And in terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting Q3 to be in the range of $1.65 to $1.70. As always, in interpreting our full-year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as they\u2019re most likely view of how we see the year playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets during the balance of the year. ", "In summary, we delivered a very strong quarter which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year. ", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ken.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Thanks, Pete. We\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question is from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "So I wanted to start maybe a little bit of reflection on sort of the sequential shift in the business. So obviously this quarter turned out a lot better than last quarter and sort of I am sure on your mind as well as sort of investors, as you look at the key changes sequentially and how sort of the business performed, what it means for what actually happened in Q1, could you walk through maybe the two or three key things we should focus on, it seems like China is probably one of them, of what changed sequentially and is it seemed more like 1Q was really now a weather phenomenon versus anything performance wise in the business?", "Marc Casper", "So Ross, thanks for the question. The first one I would think about is we look at the half in total, right? and say if you look at the half we feel like we are right on track from our original expectations in terms of end markets, actually slightly better and obviously we\u2019ve been raising our earnings outlook consistently throughout the year since our original guidance in January. So we feel things are playing out well. From Q1 obviously there were some headwinds that made it for a softer quarter, I thought generally the company performed well but obviously between weather and some other things, we had [ph] little lower organic growth than the target for the full year. Obviously when we look at Q2, we\u2019re ahead, in a strong quarter it averages out okay. ", "When you think about it sequentially between the two quarters, healthcare and diagnostics was much stronger in the quarter and we were able to maintain excellent momentum in pharma and biotech. So those are the two things sequentially worth noting when you think about it from the end market perspective. It\u2019s nice to see actually academic and government growing again, still low single digits but that was good. From a geographic perspective, when you think about, when healthcare and diagnostics is doing well and certainly with some growth in academic and government, the US performed much better. So that\u2019s the positive. The challenge was China, in terms of flat growth in the quarter. And when I look at that especially given that China has been a significant growth driver for the company for us to deliver 5% organic, with the flat China it says how well the company is performing. And within China, we still feel good about the outlook, obviously high teens bookings growth is encouraging and should lead to a stronger second half in China than what we had in the first half.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "I guess maybe just if I could dig a little bit deeper on sort of China. I mean I think you\u2019re over there not too long ago. I mean if you think about the different moving parts whether it's the performances, sort of the multinational given as some of the corruption crackdown or sort of the government trying to kind of control the pacing of spend in certain regions or the pocketbook of some of the different outer regions. As you think about the sort of disconnect between raids [ph] and bookings, and you think about the pacing and what\u2019s likely to be the next thing to focus on there, what are you \u2013 how do you see those various moving parts basically kind of translating back into superior growth to what we've seen in the last quarter or two?", "Marc Casper", "Sure. So when you look at the quarter, clearly the release of government funds was very muted relative to quite a period of time. An example of what's causing that would be very well-publicized changes in how the food safety administration is being organized, right, so an important buyer of analytical instruments in particular is going through a reorganization, right. So that's an example that clearly slowed things down. The team, as they were seeing those changes, actually focused where funds were more elusive, if you will and that\u2019s why the bookings growth is so strong. Basically they put their focus on other parts of the market segment which is exactly what I would expect the commercial team to do. So that gives us the confidence that the second half would have stronger growth than the first half. ", "I am heading off to China in a few weeks times, it's a very important market for the company and we have a great position there. So the changes that we are feeling right now I don't think have any long-term effect on the business and we\u2019re very confident about not only the second half but also the long-term prospects here. It\u2019s how I would think about it, Ross. ", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "Great, thanks and Marc, jets playoffs? No playoffs.", "Marc Casper", "Playoffs, of course, I am always bullish. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jon Groberg from Macquarie. ", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "I guess if you think of -- Marc, if you think about \u2013 you talked about the different end markets and geographies but I guess I have heard it from a few people, few others recently this idea that given all the investment in genomics so that you\u2019re starting to see potentially kind of equal types of investments on the genomics or the proteomics side from mass spec. And I guess -- my question is, just as you look out there what are you \u2013 I guess what opportunities do you see, this incremental spend in R&D, this growth \u2013 these investments in R&D and then in SG&A, where are you making those \u2013 I guess what do you expect to see \u2013 expect the growth drivers to be over the next 6 to 12 months here?", "Marc Casper", "So, Jon, thanks for the question. So let's start with proteomics first which is our mass spec business is doing great. We have excellent momentum in terms of the actual results in the first half of the year, results in the second quarter, bookings outlook, I went to ASMS, I saw a few of you there, fabulous conference for Thermo Fisher. That's obviously the expectation we set every year but it\u2019s nice to actually deliver on it year in and year out and we are dominating that field and doing a great job. And when you have organizations like Harvard Medical School and Mass General using the instrumentation to do totally new types of research, that's opening up more high-end opportunities which is great, but we\u2019re also seeing strength in some of the more applications driven opportunities as well, kind of your environmental food safety, routine pharmaceutical work and that\u2019s why we have some new applied instruments as well. ", "There is clearly lots of interest in on the genomics side as well and we had a good quarter in terms of growth in our next-gen sequencing business. So I feel good about that opportunity. So things that we\u2019re focusing on obviously is innovation, big emphasis on next gen, big emphasis on life sciences mass spec, chromatography, we\u2019re very excited about. Asia-Pacific, very important to us, in or value proposition, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive our growth for the foreseeable future. ", "Jon Groberg - Macquarie Capital", "Okay, and if I could just follow up on thinking about the portfolio little bit. Can you maybe talk about your rationale for divesting Cole Parmer? I mean it seems to be a third party distributor, kind of like some of your other channels, and are there other things that you're looking out there from a divestiture standpoint that you can share? Thanks.", "Marc Casper", "Yes, so, Jon, so two big questions there. So first in terms of we have other divestitures in the queue, the answer is no. Nothing, nothing planned and certainly nothing materially there, so in terms of why the divestiture of Cole Parmer. It\u2019s one business that actually \u2013 I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve really ever talked about in the many years but it's a niche specialty channel. It was purchased by Fisher Scientific when the company was purely a channel business. We ran it separately from the other channels because there was less opportunity to sell. Our Thermo Scientific self-manufactured products through the channel and we felt like it was appropriate timeframe to sell that particular business because of the really separate from our channel business, separate from our self-manufacturing business and thought that selling it made the most sense. And we\u2019re going to use the proceeds, as Pete said, to repay debt more quickly. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So Marc, can you go \u2013 I am a little bit surprised, I am pleasantly surprised by the 6% growth in the LPS business which I haven't seen numbers like that for a while. Can you give us a little bit more color on the segments, what lab products, biopharma and the research and specialty market channels grew, I know you don\u2019t usually give that color of detail, I just wonder just qualitative on this, I am just curious in terms of where the strength was?", "Marc Casper", "Very strong quarter, biopharma service is a great business, it\u2019s been doing great for a long period of time, continues to do well. So that\u2019s no change in the trend. Pharmaceutical companies continue to outsource that activity to us, we\u2019re the low-cost provider, the high-quality provider, so it\u2019s a terrific business. Our channel business had a good quarter, our lab consumables business had a good quarter, our lab equipment business had a good quarter. So each of the components of lab products and services did well.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just I will have one follow up. I\u2019ve had some questions lately from people asking about alternative lab channels, things in the catalog business, particularly like Amazon some of these things. I mean have you seen any impact at all from some of these other venues trying to the muscle in on the catalog business?", "Marc Casper", "No, we haven't seen any impact. We obviously take all competitors very seriously and I think Alan Malus did a really nice job with the analyst meeting articulating how we\u2019re leveraging the added strength in our e-business approach that Life technologies brought to the company to make it even better channel to market. So \u2013 but we take all competition seriously and \u2013 but we haven\u2019t seen any effect there. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Given the momentum coming out of the quarter, I am wondering if you could talk a little bit about some of the expectations in the back half of the year in particular on pharma. You talked about some momentum in biopharma services, previously you talked about a little bit of an anticipated slowdown in that business. So can you maybe talk about what\u2019s baked in the guidance for pharma? And then also can you quantify what you're expecting in China in the back half of the year, you talked about it rebound to double digits previously so?", "Marc Casper", "So Tycho, starting with the back half of the year for pharma and biotech, our comparisons get more challenging, so we\u2019re assuming mid single digit growth in the back half of the year. That would lead in aggregate for the full year for pharma and biotech for us to be mid to high single-digit growth. And if you recall back to our January guidance we assumed mid single-digit growth. So little bit better outlook for that segment, or that customer set in total. ", "In terms of China, we\u2019re assuming high single-digit growth for the full year. We had mid-single digit growth in the first half of year, so that\u2019s implying a stronger second half of the year based on the strong bookings performance we just delivered. ", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay and then on your comments earlier on proteomics, post the ASMS, you announced the [indiscernible] system, can you talk a little bit about your strategy on the chromatography side, are you making a bigger push here, on particularly around UPLC?", "Marc Casper", "So Tycho, in terms of \u2013 after the quarter closed, we launched our next generation UHPLC, I will save the detailed victory lap for our October remarks, but I will give you a little bit of a highlight. So we acquired Dionex a few years ago, the business has done well for us. We took the R&D teams from legacy Dionex and Thermo Fisher and we really have brought out a fabulous new UHPLC which we launched around July 15 and we think it's a very meaningful product launch and it\u2019s going after a large market where we have a presence but we\u2019re not the industry leader and we\u2019re targeted at gaining some market share there.", "Tycho Peterson \u2013 JPMorgan", "And then one last one, you talked about potentially looking at some bolt-ons before 3Q \u201915, when you\u2019re going to start to more fully utilize capital fund, just any thoughts on the tuck-in environment right now?", "Marc Casper", "There\u2019s certainly some things out there but nothing significant and \u2013 there is some activity level, you\u2019ve seen some things announced in the marketplace and we did a small food and animal health deal last quarter, very small and -- but it's not super active right now is the way I would characterize it. And again as I said in the past that if something looked exciting and compelling and create a shareholder value, we would consider it.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "So actually maybe building off of that last question, you\u2019d previously talked about getting down to 2.5, 3 times debt to EBITDA by Q3, you reiterated that this morning. But when you look at the Cole Parmer divestiture, synergy is tracking ahead of plan and looking at this quarter where you had a really strong cash flow performance and paid down debt at a pretty good good cliff. It does seem at least mathematically increasingly possible that you get to closer to 3 times in the first half maybe in the \u2013 maybe even in the first quarter with a couple other \u2013 couple more strong quarters. Would you agree? And if so, at what point would you declare that you can actually confidently do a little bit better than previous guidance?", "Peter Wilver", "So I will take that one. So when you look at the forecast certainly adding 340 million of proceeds net from the Cole Parmer divestiture gets us earlier in Q3 but it doesn't necessarily pull us into the first half. Seasonally first quarter cash flow is generally weak, obviously it was very weak this year but we don't expect that next year. So when you look at first half versus second half free cash flow, it doesn\u2019t necessarily flow pro rata. I would say we\u2019re down to early in Q3 at this point. But we\u2019re not into the first quarter anything like that. ", "Marc Casper", "Obviously we\u2019re driving our cash flow hard, we\u2019re focused on debt repayment. This company is focused on creating shareholder value. If we can get there sooner, we well but just as we modeled it out right now we think Q3 is a reasonable assumption.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company", "Maybe I can just ask another China question. So if we think back to Q1 earnings season, you really only had about two or three companies across the group talked of challenges in China related to the delayed release of government funds. Thermo wasn\u2019t one of them, as I remember that. And then over the course of the quarter, if anything I kind of got the sense that you guys downplayed this dynamic and it seems like maybe something at the end of the quarter just didn\u2019t come in the way that you expected. So I just want to get your take on that, really specifically, when did you start to see this slowdown, how broad is it across the different segments? And you did reference the high teens bookings in China and clearly your guidance as you talked about assumes that these bookings come through in the second half as you talked about high single-digit growth for the year. But if anything it seems like you didn\u2019t bump up Q3 guidance at least relative to how the Street has been modeling things. So it\u2019s not necessarily clear that you assume that\u2019s come through in some bullish in Q3, maybe more Q4 than Q3, is that the case? Really the questions are when did you see a slowdown, how broadly is this impacting you by segment in China, and do you have a lot of visibility on when this comes through in the second half?", "Marc Casper", "It\u2019s a good question. So lot too, I guess so I would say it is very straightforward, some of the bookings that we had in Q2 shipped in Q3, some shipped in Q4. So it's not as if you get everything over the next [ph] quarter, some of them are the longer lead time items. So it\u2019s a balance between the two quarters. So the strong bookings growth helped the second half of the year, it doesn\u2019t particular favour Q3 versus Q4. When you think about the view on the quarter, we didn\u2019t really talk much to my recollection about China other than on the earnings call, at the analyst meeting, you talked really just about the long-term, talked about the five year outlook for China, I don\u2019t recall talked much about it in the quarter one way or the other. We didn't see in the second and third months, obviously we had the first two weeks of benefit which seemed okay when we started the quarter. But when we did our call, but after that it wasn\u2019t particularly strong throughout the quarter. So it wasn\u2019t as if we had something happened at the end of the quarter per se, it\u2019s just government was slow in releasing funds, and that was \u2013 food safety is the biggest driver but there has been a skittishness on government spending or release of funds fairly broad-based across the economy. And I think that\u2019s actually been extraordinarily well publicized in terms of some of the things going on there.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs ", "Marc, could you maybe talk a little bit about Europe, that\u2019s probably one region that hasn\u2019t got a lot of attention here. I am curious about the performance you saw and then maybe outlook for the back half of the year?", "Marc Casper", "So Europe had a very strong quarter, feel so good about the performance broad-based, biopharma services did well, our instruments businesses did good well. There is excitement around the horizon 2020 funding. It's actually things are continuing to improve, so that's good. For the full-year we\u2019re expecting the growth to be in the range of the company average and so slightly better than our original assumption. So if you think about it geographically, Isaac, the US and Europe outlook for the full year is slightly better than our original thoughts, and obviously China a little bit weaker but the net of it from geographically it was obviously still a little stronger in aggregate.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs ", "And just a follow up on the guidance assumptions, if we look at the guidance you gave us for 3Q revenue, it does imply a pretty solid fourth quarter growth rate again this year. If you could give us a little bit of color as to what gives you confidence that you can do, it looks like to me that you had something like 4% organic on a 6% comp?", "Peter Wilver", "No, its actually pretty, pretty balanced in terms of the stack comp. So there's deceleration assumed in Q4 organic growth from Q3. ", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs ", "The deceleration sequentially?", "Peter Wilver", "Sequentially from Q3 to Q4, yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital Markets.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital", "Hi Marc, some customers have been saying the Ion PGM assays, there are some new development, more products they are seeing. Are you accelerating new product that -- with the Ion PGM or is it kind of the same pace in the past?", "Marc Casper", "So Paul, thanks for the question. So in terms of next gen sequencing, there is a lot of buzz around the PGM these days because there is work in the clinical trials area for oncology using the platform for matching patients to the right drug for various cancer types. So that\u2019s kind of a lot of buzz, when I was at the American Society of Clinical Oncology in June, that was clearly a lot of \u2013 actually that was the most important buzz in that particular conference, around anything in next gen sequencing because that\u2019s really where the clinical application is. So yes, there is products being developed and launched and a lot of good feedback on that product line.", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital", "And then service business does seem to have been slower than other parts of Thermo Fisher, any color there?", "Marc Casper", "Pete will hit that a little bit.", "Peter Wilver", "Yeah, we actually had a pretty strong growth in services certainly in the quarter. As I mentioned in analytical instruments, we had as one of the first times you\u2019ve actually called out our service business in that segment. So we had very strong growth there. So it was actually on the strong side. ", "Paul Knight - Janney Capital", "Analytical did have a good quarter versus the last four, five, six, is this the economic cycle we\u2019re seeing in analytical or academic, do you have any thoughts there, Pete or Marc?", "Marc Casper", "Yes, so when you look at the growth in the quarter, all the China government release of funds is most felt in our instrument business because we have very very strong position there. It\u2019s a high percentage of that business\u2019 total revenue mix. So while the growth was pretty good, it was a little bit less than the full-year target, really it\u2019s driven by what\u2019s going on in China. The enterprise services business which is also part of that segment did very well, so that\u2019s obviously encouraging. And there is -- a question was asked earlier, we just launched a new UHPLC product line after the quarter end, which also will help us in the second half.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias from Citi.", "Dan Arias - Citi", "If I could just go back to China funding one more time, on the environmental monitoring business, can you just make a quick comment on where we are in terms of tapping into the money that's being devoted to air quality? I think we\u2019re coming up on a year since the government announced the big investment in that area. So with the idea of going where the funds are flowing, how open has the spigot been there and just knowing that that\u2019s been one of your stronger applications?", "Marc Casper", "We\u2019re focusing on tier 3 and tier 4 cities now in installing the air monitoring network in the country. So it\u2019s well into implementation. So we did two years ago kind of tier 1, last year kind of tier 2 cities and now we are into the broad market. EPM, the environmental processing business grew in the quarter, so that was encouraging. And I would say that amazingly how time flies, soon we will be getting into the servicing aspect of those instruments and kind of the recurring stream of revenue which will be exciting as well. ", "Dan Arias - Citi", "Maybe just a hypothetical on op expenses in the context, Marc, of your comment on proteomics and genomics. If the stronger top line did allow you to invest a little bit more in incremental R&D, which of the businesses do you think you'd be more apt to allocate to?", "Marc Casper", "So right now we did invest a little bit of additional funds based on our strong performance and are allocating some additional funds for the second half of the year. We want to make sure that in our life-sciences solution segment that we have very good growth prospects for the mid to long-term. So the 3% growth that we set as our target, was actually stepped from where the business was performing, I am very pleased with the 3% in the quarter, but we\u2019re making some investments to soar up that area of the business and then of course in other parts of the company like chrom and mass spec we\u2019re making investments to capitalize on those opportunities as well.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird.", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird", "Marc, can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in the rest of world area? ", "Marc Casper", "Yeah in terms of rest of world, a softer quarter, it's a very very lumpy business because there are substantial tenders primarily in the mining sector, interestingly enough it was very big in parts of South America that drive that. So a little bit of a softer quarter but expect it to be for the full-year kind of in the mid to high single-digit growth range. Brazil was soft in the quarter but generally we feel like the outlook is good for the full-year. ", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W. Baird", "Got it. And Pete, looking at the life sciences business, could you care to guess what the pro forma op margin performance would have been had you owned that business both years? ", "Peter Wilver", "To be honest with you, we haven't calculated that number. I mean obviously a significant portion of the year-over-year increase is a result of the just adding the number in, but as I said we picked up in the quarter $23 million of acquisition synergies which is actions that we've taken as a business and the life-sciences solutions segment does productivity and sourcing and restructuring and all those things just the same way as the rest of the business does. So they are driving productivity in addition to just the addition of the Life Technologies numbers. ", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tim Evans from Wells Fargo. ", "Tim Evans - Wells Fargo Securities", "Just wanted to dig into the biopharma services business a little bit. Do you have any thoughts on what the penetration rate in this service area would be? Just trying to get a sense for what inning we might be in of this pretty substantial growth phase for that business.", "Marc Casper", "The business -- it's hard to define the exact penetration rate because the customer base is actually -- is expanding the definition of what we\u2019re doing with them which is interesting. I mean part of it is we continue to add service lines but we\u2019ve had customers say you do this so well, we like you to do syringe work with us, where we might have been doing other types of outsourcing works. So the market keeps expanding but when we just did our strategic plan review which is a five your outlook for that business, growth prospects look fabulous. So I don\u2019t know what my baseball analogy is but we are using football as we\u2019re almost at training camp time is probably the end of the first quarter with three quarters to go. ", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research ", "Just wondering if you could clarify a couple of things for me as it relates to the guidance? Just looking through things it looks like your interest expense for the year has come down a little bit, your share count's come down a little bit, FX is a little bit better than expected. You mentioned that there is maybe a $0.04 benefit from acquisitions relative to what you were thinking before. I understand the Cole-Parmer divestiture impact, but I'm just wondering, with only raising the high end of the guidance by $0.02, is there a little bit of extra conservatism built into the guidance now? ", "Peter Wilver", "No, I would say there's less conservatism built in than there was before. When you look at it we\u2019re raising the midpoint by $0.04 and then we have $0.03 from the Cole Parmer divestiture, so that\u2019s $0.07, if you look at kind of the actual versus consensus in Q2 about $0.02 of that was tax rate which doesn't affect the full-year. So you get pretty close to the $0.10 being added in to the full-year. So that reflects our good performance in Q2, and are basically carrying through that performance into the full year. ", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research ", "And then just the final thing is on China, what gives you the confidence or what could prevent the business in China not being delayed for another quarter or for another six months? Do you have confidence that as that business starts to come back here in the third quarter? ", "Marc Casper", "The team is very experienced with a great track record. In the quarter that we had, we didn\u2019t have cancellations, in that sort, so usually when bookings happen they ship. I mean so from that perspective, we have high confidence that the business is going to perform. It is a centrally controlled economies, so if the government wants to do something different anything is possible but that wouldn\u2019t be available a Thermo Fisher specific thing, that will be a major macroeconomic factor which no one is predicting. So I would say we feel good about the outlook in China, Steve.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research ", "Okay, thanks.", "Marc Casper", "All right. Let me wrap it up. We had a very strong Q2, it puts us right on track at the halfway point of the year and positions is to achieve a very strong 2014. As always, thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher and we look forward to updating you our progress next quarter. ", "Operator", "Thank you for joining. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until November 21, 2014. A copy of the press release of our 2014 third quarter earnings and future expectations is also available on our website under the heading Financial Results.", "", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 28, 2014, under the caption, Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "", "Also during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2014 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "", "Also before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary we provide on today\u2019s call regarding the company\u2019s total revenue growth and revenue growth by end market and geography are on an organic basis only, and therefore do not include the performance of Life Technologies.", "", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ken. And good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us on today\u2019s for our Q3 earnings call. I am pleased to report that we had a strong quarter and we're on track to achieve a successful year. Financially we delivered good top line growth and outstanding growth in adjusted EPS. We continue to strengthen our position as the industry leader by innovating and gaining share in the markets we serve.", "I am also pleased to report that our integration of Life Technologies is progressing ahead of our expectations. I'll cover more on these highlights later in my remarks, but first let me start with the financials.", "As you saw in our press release, our total revenue for the quarter grew 31% year-over-year. Adjusted operating income was $915 million in Q3 and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 250 basis points to 21.9%.", "Turning to our adjusted EPS performance, we delivered another outstanding quarter with 32% growth in adjusted EPS to $1.71 per share. Our team effectively leveraged our top line growth and drove excellent productivity to the operational discipline of our PPI business system. This resulted in outstanding performance on the bottom line.", "We also generated good cash flow in Q3. We're continuing to use our strong cash flow to pay down debt and we're on track to reach our target leverage by Q3 of 2015. As we move into 2015, we intend to resume our strategy of disciplined capital deployment. As you know this is a combination of strengthening our strategic position through M&A and retuning capital to our shareholders through buybacks and dividends.", "I'll now turn to our four key end markets and give you some color on what we saw relative to our overall growth in the quarter. At a high level, we delivered mid single digit growth in three of our end markets and similar to last quarter academic and government grew in the low single digits.", "Industrial and applied markets our performance here was stronger in Q3 than in the first half of the year. To give you a couple of the highlights. First, we had good performance in our channel, with some nice wins from industrial customers who are recognizing the benefits of our customer value proposition. In addition, our chromatography business reported good growth.", "In diagnostics and healthcare, we performed well again this quarter. The dynamic in this end market was pretty similar to what we saw in Q2. Our clinical diagnostics businesses had another good quarter with continued strong sales of our biomarker tests.", "And our growth in immunodiagnostics business was very strong driven largely by demand for allergy tests. In particular, our [Vue] [ph] allergy test has been well received and is growing rapidly. This is a test that we developed for our Japanese customer base and launched at the beginning of the year.", "Turning to pharma and biotech. We saw good growth from this customer set in the quarter and our biopharma services business continues to perform well. One recent development in this end market that we're excited about is our new partnership with long time customers GSK and Pfizer. We signed an agreement with them to develop a universal next gen sequencing oncology test that could service a companion diagnostic for multiple drug programs.", "The goal of the diagnostic is to enable a comprehensive set of analysis of multiple and relevant genetic markers using a single test. With this information cancer patients could potentially benefit from therapies that are much more targeted to their tumor\u2019s genetic profile.", "In academic and government conditions were very similar to Q2, with year-over-year improvement in North America, offset by weakness in China. So before I move on to the business highlights, let me give you some commentary from a geographic perspective.", "At a high level we haven\u2019t seen any significant changes in our key geographies since last quarter. With that said, I do want to make comment on China. Our growth in China in Q3 was in the low single digits. A little better than Q2, but below what we included in our previous guidance. This was due to the slow release of funding by the Chinese government which is impacting revenue.", "The good news is that despite the conditions in China we again delivered mid single digit growth for the company overall. This speaks to the advantages we have through our global geographic coverage, diverse end markets and strength of our value proposition.", "Let me now shift to highlight some of the exciting new products we launched in the quarter that strengthened our leadership position and creates new opportunities for us to gain market share. As you know, innovation is a core element of our growth strategy and we\u2019ve had a very strong year of new product introductions across our technology portfolio.", "Early in Q3 we launched a breakthrough UHPLC system, the Thermo Scientific Vanquish. This is a significant technology advancement because it solves two key issues for our customers in the applied markets. First, these customers need exceptional accuracy and precision as they separate out individual components and their samples.", "And second, they need to run their analysis faster to improve productivity and manage the high volume of samples in their labs. We also launched new Accucore columns that are specifically designed to optimize performance on the Vanquish system. Of course Vanquish runs on our to gold-standard Chromeleon chromatography data system making it a simple but highly effective tool for customers working in food safety, industrial or biopharma labs.", "In our Life Sciences Solutions business an important part of the integrations strategy is to accelerate growth by increasing the impact of new product launches. In the quarter we launched the Attune Acoustic Flow \u2013 Acoustic Focusing Flow Cytometer, which offers Life Science researchers both high sensitivity and high throughput for cell analysis. I was out with our team in Eugene, Oregon in August and it was great to see their excitement around this new generation technology.", "Attune is designed to provide multiple capabilities as single instrument, providing a cost effective and virtual solution for customer application ranging from biomarker discovery to cancer research.", "I also want to highlight several examples in the quarter that illustrate how we're supporting a growing trend that we talked about a lot. The convergence of life sciences tools and diagnostics.", "At AACC, the leading Expo in North America for clinical customers, we showcased expanded diagnostic offering of specialty assays, analytical instrument and genetic analysis technologies.", "We featured our ImmunoCAP and EliA test for allergy and autoimmunity testing, as well assays for drugs-of-abuse and transplant monitoring. For the first time we launched new analytical instruments in software that are now listed with FDA as Class I medical devices for clinical use. The Prelude MD HPLC, the Endura MD mass spectrometer and the ClinQuan MD software.", "In our next gen sequencing portfolio we showcased the Ion Torrent PGM and recently launched Ion Chef sample prep although at the time both instruments were intended for research use only. Since then however, we introduced the Ion PGM Dx system in both the US and Europe for clinical use.", "The PGM Dx will enable our clinical customers to more easily develop and implement new next gen sequencing diagnostic assays in their laboratories. This means they will be able to simultaneously screen hundreds of genes from patients samples with the rapid turnaround with tough time required in a clinical study. All of these new products are great examples of how we fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.", "Another example of this is our involvement in the Ebola crisis. We're helping our customer whether they are in government agencies, hospital or industry to get the products they need to contain this global threat. We're providing a steady supply of necessary reagents to public health labs. Here in the US and globally that are screening to positively identify a Ebola in patients who show symptoms.", "These reagents are used in combination with two independent Ebola assays developed by the CDC and the DOD, both have received emergency used authorization. We also have more then 400 of our Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Dx, qPCR platforms in labs around the world that have been authorized to run these tasks.", "Before I turn to our guidance, let me give you quick update on the Life Technologies integration. Our teams continue to make excellent progress implementing their plans and the revenue growth of our Life Sciences Solutions business is right in line with our acquisition assumptions.", "Last quarter you'll recall that we increased our expected synergies for 2014 to $100 million from the $85 million we announced when we closed the deal. I am pleased to say that we now expect to deliver a little more than a $100 million by the end of the year to accelerating some cost synergy actions. We also remain confident in overall adjusted operating income synergy target of $350 million for the year three which we highlighted at our May Analyst meeting.", "Turning now to our annual guidance. As you saw on our press release, we've updated our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance, primarily on the recent unfavorable changes in FX. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $16.74 billion to $16.82 billion which leads to 28% growth over 2013. This led us to tighten our adjusted EPS range to $6.87 to $6.95 for a 27% to 28% growth in 2014. The key point I want to make here is that despite the FX headwinds we maintained the mid point of our adjusted EPS range.", "Before turn the call over to Pete, let me leave you with a few thoughts about where we are at this point in the year. In terms of our top line growth, while certain emerging markets have been weaker than expected, we delivered solid growth for the company overall. The Life technologies integration continues to progress very smoothly.", "Finally, our strong financial performance over the past nine months and our intense focus on driving operational improvements are keeping us on track to achieve our adjusted EPS goal for the year. All of these achievements create a solid foundation for a strong 2015.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete Wilver, our CFO. Pete?", "Pete Wilver", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our total company Q3 financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our updated 2014 guidance.", "As a reminder, at the total company level, we\u2019re reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means we'll exclude the results of Life Technologies until we reach the one year anniversary date of the acquisition in early 2015.", "However as we\u2019ve mentioned before for the Life Sciences Solution segment, we're providing organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis, as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2013 and 2014, to give you some insight into the growth performance of that segment. Additionally our results exclude Cole-Parmer from the date of the divestiture, August 15, consistent with our previous guidance.", "So starting with our overall financial performance. We grew adjusted EPS by 32% to $1.71. GAAP EPS was $1.17 in Q3, up 36% from $0.86 in the prior year.", "Looking at the top line. We delivered 4% organic revenue growth this quarter and total revenue increased 31% year-over-year. Q3 reported revenue includes 27 points of growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and an immaterial impact from foreign exchange. We strengthened our backlog slightly in the quarter with bookings a bit higher than revenue.", "By geography, North America grew in the mid single digits and Europe grew in the high single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low single digits with China also growing in the low single digits as Marc mentioned. Rest of the world was mix, but in aggregate declined in the low single digits.", "Looking at our operational performance. Q3 adjusted operating income increased 48% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 250 basis points from Q3 last year. Our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven primarily by the Life Technologies acquisition and achieving the related synergies.", "That said, we also continue to see strong contribution from our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, site consolidations and our PPI business system. We had margin expansion from FX in the third quarter, but we expect FX to be dilutive to our margin in the fourth quarter due to the significant strengthening of the dollar versus our major currencies at the end of Q3 and into early Q4.", "We realized $33 million of synergy benefits in Q3 and $73 million year-to-date. This puts us on track to slightly exceed the $100 million cost synergies we were targeting for full year 2014. During the quarter we continue to make strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities to accelerate growth.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.1% in Q3, up 510 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily due to the addition of Life Technologies along with solid productivity across our businesses.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 22.9% of revenue, which is a 130 basis points unfavorable to 2013 quarter. Again this is primarily a result of the acquisition and was partially offset by volume leverage in our synergy and productivity actions.", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue for the quarter, a 120 basis points above the prior year. This reflects the impact of the relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3 was 6.6%.", "Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense in Q3 was $106 million, up $49 million from last year driven by the interest on the debt we raised to fund the Life Technologies acquisition. Adjusted other income for Q3 was $2 million, slightly higher than Q3 last year.", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.8%, 50 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of our acquisition tax planning. Our year-to-date rate was 15% in line with our full-year outlook of about 15%.", "In terms of returning capital, we paid out $60 million in dividends to our shareholders in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 403.7 million in Q3, up 36 million or 10% from last year primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, and to a much lesser extent option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. Cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was $1.67 billion and free cash flow was $1.42 billion after deducting $250 million of net capital expenditures. This is up significantly from our prior year cash flow primarily as a result of increased operating earnings from the acquisition and standalone business partially offset by acquisition related interest expense and cash payments tied to the acquisition and related divestitures.", "We ended the quarter with $544 million in cash and investments, down $62 million sequentially from Q2. We used the Cole-Parmer proceeds and cash generated in the quarter along with surplus cash on the balance sheet to pay down short-term debt during the quarter. As a result, our total debt at the end of Q3 was $14.5 billion, down $1.1 billion from Q2.", "Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.9 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA and we remain on track to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 to 3 times in Q3, 2015.", "So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in the third quarter of 2014 was 9.3%, flat to Q2. This is a good result as increased returns across the business offset the short term dilution of adding another quarter of the Life Technologies investment into the average invested capital base.", "So with that, now I\u2019ll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solution segment, in Q3 total revenue grew to $1.07 billion from $167 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition net of the divestitures.", "On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned for the entire quarter in both periods, organic revenue grew 3% for the second quarter in a row. In the quarter we saw a strong growth in our bio production, next generation sequencing and cell biology businesses and we also saw a good growth in our applied markets, including human identification and animal food and environmental.", "Q3 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solution increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition and achieving the related synergies, with adjusted operating margin up 530 basis points to 28.6%.", "In the analytical instruments segment both reported and organic revenue grew 3%. In the quarter we had very strong growth in our chromatography and instrument services businesses, which was partially offset by the weakness in China very similar to last quarter.", "Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increase 5% and adjusted operating margin was 17.5%, up 40 basis points. We delivered very strong productivity and saw a positive contribution from FX that were partially offset by a strategic growth investments and unfavorable business mix.", "Turning to the specialty diagnostic segment, in Q3 total revenue grew 7% and organic growth was a very strong again at 6%. We continue to deliver strong growth across much of the portfolio. As Marc mentioned, our immunodiagnostics business had a very strong quarter and growth in our clinical diagnostic business was notable as well.", "Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 10% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 27.6%, up 70 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong pull-through on the organic growth, good productivity and a positive benefit from FX, partially offset by strategic growth investments.", "In the laboratory products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue grew 2% and organic revenue grew 4%. Our biopharma services business continue to have good performance. The segment also benefited from continued improvement in our US academic and government end market, as well as an increased impact of our customer value proposition in industrial markets.", "Adjusted operating income in laboratory products and services grew 1% for the quarter and adjusted operating margin was 15.1%, down 30 basis points driven by unfavorable business mix and the Cole Parmer divestiture, partially offset by strong productivity.", "So with that, I\u2019d like to review the details of our update full-year 2014 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we\u2019re updating our guidance to reflect our strong year-to-date performance and the impact of the recent unfavorable currency fluctuations. Stating with revenue, with one quarter to go we're tightening the range by $40 million and lowering the mid point by $140 million.", "This changes solely a result of the unfavorable FX impact of current rates on total company revenue for the remainder of the year. This leads to our new full year 2014 revenue guidance of $16.74 billion to $16.82 billion which represents year-over-year growth of 28%.", "On an organic basis, we\u2019re still expecting standalone organic growth for full-year 2014 of 3% to 4% no change from our previous guidance. As I mentioned earlier, our total company organic growth does not include results of Life Technologies. For the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we still expect pro forma organic growth of 2% to 3% for full-year 2014 also unchanged from our previous guidance.", "In terms of FX, assuming recent rates, the year-over-year foreign-currency impact on our standalone revenue for the full year has gone from about 50 basis points positive in our previous guidance to about 25 basis points negative in our current guidance. We're experiencing a similar unfavorable impact due to the change in FX rates on our Life Sciences solutions revenue, although this is reflected as acquisition revenues rather than FX in our organic growth calculation.", "In terms of margin pull-through on total FX revenue, we\u2019re now expecting a minimal positive impact for the full year, down considerably from our previous guidance. Although we've seen a margin benefit from FX year-to-date, we're assuming a fairly significant negative impact in the fourth quarter due to the recent change in rates. Consistent with past practice, we haven't attempted to forecast future foreign currency exchange rates and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Moving to adjusted EPS, as you saw in our press release, we\u2019re maintaining the mid point and tightening the range consistent with revenue range and reflecting our strong financial results year-to-date. This leads to a new full-year 2014 adjusted EPS guidance range of $6.87 to $6.95 which represents growth of 27% to 28% over our 2013 earnings per share of $5.42.", "As mentioned earlier, although we have significant unfavorable earnings impact from FX compared to our previous guidance, which results in about a $0.07 of adjusted EPS headwind, we're not changing mid point of our adjusted EPS guidance. We expect to offset the FX headwind with a combination of incremental productivity and accelerated acquisition cost synergies, along with about $0.01 of below the line benefit. Turning to adjusted operating margin, we\u2019re expecting roughly 250 basis points of expansion to about 22% at the higher end of our previous guidance.", "Moving below the line, we\u2019re expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $425 million to $435 million, consistent with our previous guidance. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re still expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 15% consistent with our previous guidance.", "In terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re still assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. And we're also assuming that we'll continue to use the bulk of our free cash flow to pay down short-term debt.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 403 million, up about 10% from 2013 and consistent with our previous guidance. We\u2019re expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $410 million to $430 million, down about $50 million from our previous guidance, based on actively managing our project spend, as well as identifying some duplicate investments as we get further into the integration.", "Finally, in terms of full-year 2014 free cash flow, we are maintaining our previous guidance of about $2.2 billion. We made good progress on cash flow year-to-date. But as I mentioned on last quarters call, we'll need perform very well in Q4 to offset the cash tax headwind created by the one time gain we realized from the Cole Parmer divestiture.", "As always, in interpreting our full year revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the mid point as our most likely view of how we see the year planning out. Results above or below the mid point will depend on the relative strength of our markets during Q4.", "So in summary, we delivered a very strong quarter which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year.", "With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Ken.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "", "Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we\u2019re ready to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from ISI Group. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Marc Casper", "", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "So, lot of color so thank you. But can you give us a little bit of sort of understanding of the trending on a geographic base in sort of the Europe business, as well as sort of Asia-Pac and I guess more specifically China as we kind of pace through the quarter and how it sort of matched up to the degree you can dig down on the bookings line you know, there is obviously lot of macro concern in both of those regions.", "I was just trying get a feel for which parts of your business are showing sort of strength or more stability, in which parts you're probably much more concerned about in those geographic areas?", "Marc Casper", "", "So Ross, thanks for the question. So let's start out with Europe. And you\u2019ve heard us talk many times in the past, we see Europe as a low single digit market from a growth outlook, and we\u2019ve said that consistently. Our team is executing extremely well in Europe. We actually delivered high single digit growth in the quarter. Our diagnostics businesses which have reasonable exposure to the European market, particularly immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics have large presence there. They are both doing extremely well.", "Our biopharma services business did very well in Europe. So the team is executing well and while we don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to be a high single digit growth you know, really on a long-term basis, you know, team is doing great. So that\u2019s positive.", "Asia Pacific, really the story in Asia Pacific is really around China which is the way you reflected in your question. When I think about what's going on in China, we delivered low single digit growth in the quarter which actually is a little better than what we had in Q2. But it was below the expectations that we had \u2013 as we thought about last quarter.", "What we saw in China was a slow release of funds across the markets and we think that\u2019s been driven by the government both in how they\u2019ve reorganized the food safety administration, as well as their focus on transparency and you know, cracking down on corruption that the approval times to get fund releases is definitely extended significantly.", "From a longer term perspective, we continue to remain very positive on China. Our strategy is unchanged, so we have a tremendous advantage of scale, a great team and we're very well aligned with the Chinese priorities, which is you know clean waters, safe food, better environment, expanding healthcare capabilities. So long-term it\u2019s good, but short term has been quite uncertain.", "So I sum it up in this way, revenue growth has been mid single digits through the first nine months is what is averaged out to be. Bookings has been stronger than that, so customer activity remains high, but funds are slow to release and as we look at the fourth quarter in the uncertain environment what we're assuming is a wider range of outcomes somewhere from low to mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "", "Thanks. And maybe just talking to kind of the performance overall in the quarter. I mean, I am looking at the market right now, it looks like people are kind of implying that this was sort of a disappointing result, I mean, we took it as more and sort of in line.", "I mean, as you think about your execution year-to-date how the quarterly EPS is sort of paced and how that\u2019s tracked versus your original expectations, how would you kind of characterize today's result and it seems like the overall 4% organic growth for a choppy macro is a pretty good outcome, I'd be curious how you think about that as well relative to peers?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. So when I look at where we are at nine months, year-to-date or in Q3 clearly from the beginning of the year, China is slower than I think what anybody would have anticipated if we're sitting here in January. And we are right on track to delver the organic growth outlook that we did. So you know, North America has gotten better and the team has executed very well. So I feel good about that to say we're right in track with 3% to 4% organic growth for the full year.", "I am also very pleased with the organic growth rates of our Life Sciences Solutions segment which is doing better than it had done for several years in the past, you know, and I don\u2019t get excited about 2% to 3% growth in terms of our outlook. But you know it\u2019s one thing to say it and another thing to actually do it and the team has done a good job of delivering that range of growth. So I feel good about that.", "Our primary metric is adjusted EPS and we are doing an excellent job of delivering strong earnings growth. That\u2019s a combination of the synergies, the combination of a smooth integration and the power of our PPI business system. And when I look at the outlook, you know when I think about having a $0.07 headwind because of change in FX rates at the end of September an into October and the company's ability to offset that fully at the mid point of our guidance, I think it gives you a sense of the power of the execution model and really it sets us out for a very strong 2015.", "So that\u2019s the high level; our job is to power through the challenges and what we do is to explain what's going on, but at the end of day we're going to put up good results and we put up good earnings growth in Q3.", "Ross Muken - ISI Group", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.", "Thanks, guys. Just following up on the guidance, you know, can you maybe talk about whether it\u2019s stronger to offset China being weaker than anticipated for the fourth quarter and other aspects where you're seeing a little bit more incrementally positive [Inaudible] in the year end?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, if you look at it geographically North America we're expecting to be a bit stronger than when we had given the guidance quarter ago and when you think of it from an end market perspective, industrial and applied and healthcare and diagnostics will be a little bit stronger than what we would have said three months ago.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.", "Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then thinking a little bit about the capital deployment priorities and you're heading into next year is you know, you are at a point where you can start to at least think about deploying a little bit more capital. Can you maybe just talk about the M&A pipeline and how you're thinking about opportunities there, should we think about bolt-ons or potentially larger deals?", "Marc Casper", "Tycho, thanks for questions. So first on the capital deployment side of the equation. We paid down over a $1 billion in debt in the quarter. We are on track to hit our target leverage ratio in Q3 of next year. I think based on how well the integration is going and based on us delivering on the cash flows that we expected to delver, we feel confident and comfortable as we move into 2015 to once again start our disciplined, capital deployment strategy. So we don\u2019t feel required to wait until Q3 when we actually achieved the target leverage ratio, but actually you know sometime earlier in the year be able to begin executing it.", "In terms of the M&A pipeline, there is always a pipeline of activity that we look on and there is always a steady stream of bolt-ons that we would \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have been evaluating. So the team has been active and I would expect over time you'd see us to do some things.", "The reality is as you know from the many years of covering the company is, we don\u2019t assume any M&A is going to happen. We just assume that we'll have a good pipeline and if we like the fit of a deal and how it helps our customers and if it gives us the returns that we want then we'll go ahead and execute against it. So, not much has changed from that dynamic.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.", "Last one, there was some noise lately around the Kinetica software platform, can you maybe just talk about you know how important that is in the grand scheme of things and next steps and the degree to which you could ultimately be liable if at all for growth if that have been approved?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, thanks for the question. In terms of Kinetica tiny product line, I had to look it up over the last 10 years in total we sold about $1 million worth of the product, okay, so it\u2019s in the infinitesimal side. We take the issue very seriously obviously and the team is conducting a very thorough internal review.", "In terms of the potential impact, in the US it seems to be a non-issue as the FDA has stated clearly that it independently analyzes the bio equivalence data in their generic drug approval process. So, that doesn\u2019t seem to be an issue and we're right now going through and confirming what the processes are in Europe in particular to understand that better. So that\u2019s where we are with Kinetica.", "Tycho Peterson - JPMorgan.", "Okay. Thank you. And congrats on the quarter.", "Marc Casper", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Hi, good morning.", "Marc Casper", "Good morning.", "Pete Wilver", "", "Good morning, Derik.", "", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "", "Pete, just though we have little bit of basis then with people you know as we started thinking about 2015. Can you just give us sort of what you think at today's rate the FX hit would be on '15 just to help us little bit better tell where your model?", "Pete Wilver", "So, it\u2019s a little early for us to comment on 2015, but obviously we'll provide a complete guidance as we normally do. In January on Q4 earnings call that said, if today's rates were to hold over the course to next year that would clearly be a revenue and earning side when compared to where we are today. In terms of the magnitude, we'll get into that when we provide detail guidance in January.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. You the lab products and services business is been remarkably strong for the last couple of years and you've been pushing up 4% organic revenue growth its been averaging and lot of that\u2019s been driven by the biopharma services business, and what some broader thought on the LPS business, is it sort of stay at that rate is it normalized more back towards of 8% range going forward. I am just curious in terms of the stability in the business?", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah, so when you look at the lab product and services business, it is the heart of Australian productivity for our customer and which is why the business has continued to and has a you know continue to do well and has a bright outlook effectively the combination of our channel which allows customers to manage the huge complexcity of life science tools is in their research labs the biopharma services business which drives significant productivity in the R&D process in the clinical trials logistic outsourcing and our very large base of equipment and consumables that are used every and everyday in every laboratory help our customers speculate choice on those products, means that what we do here is very relevant.", "Team has executed very well. We've had you know a good base of customer continuing to take advantage of our capabilities and we've delivered good growth. Whether it will be three or four in any given quarters it\u2019s you know it\u2019s hard to predict. But exactly but I do feel good about the growth prospects of the business Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you so much. I'll get back in the queue.", "Pete Wilver", "Hey, Derik, one other just clarification on your question about FX, so as I mentioned in my comments we have only been reporting the FX revenue and impact related to standalone this year but obviously going into 2015, somewhat what we've been referring to as in a day [Golompus] acquisition, we'll be FX, so you have to take into account the impact of FX on the Life Sciences Solutions revenue as well. So the number will be just as a starting point be bigger in terms of revenue outlined US dollar.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right, I many know life had a lot more, your exposure certainly and your margins that trend, that\u2019s where I was getting, just a little bit of magnitude on hitting back.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah, as well as yen.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got you. Okay. Thanks.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "We'll make sure we bridge there very carefully when we get into January.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.", "Hey, good morning guys. And thanks for taking the questions. So I guess to somewhat related questions, the first is really life tech synergies, recognizing the update you provided indicates that you guys are tracking are smidge ahead of planned, based on prior Thermo deals and recognizing I think a lot of us thought there were lot of inefficiencies within life check. I think it\u2019s fair to assert that the expectation in the investment community were a little bit higher for upside relative to your synergy targets, you guys seem pretty happy with this.", "And I guess what I am wondering is that part of this is because you think you are on the cost of an acceleration in the pace of synergies and I make this point largely because as you talked about you maintained EPS guidance for the year in spite of some you know pretty now intense FX headwinds heading into Q4 and without China coming back when you essentially raised underlying EPS guidance for the year by $0.07 even fastening in FX. I mean you guys did acknowledge that you do expect deal synergies to be part of this so I am just wondering if you think you're on the cost but really accelerating the pace of deal synergies associated with the life deal?", "Marc Casper", "So, those are few things, we have been obviously tracking ahead of the synergies both in the first year and in the longer term right. So from the first year we've actually increased three or four times one of the thins that we really don\u2019t like to do is actually is that and it almost sounds cute, that we're raising by x million each quarter, that isn\u2019t the way we like it, first off its simple reason that it affects our colleagues right, and therefore I actually don\u2019t like the dynamic of talking too much about it, but rather you know whether we are on track to achieve our broader goals.", "I think given the magnitude of the FX headwinds you know we clearly as a team have been driving productivity hard across the entire business, so which every business is focused on and not into Life Science Solutions business as well. So yes we are accelerating the synergies and we're also accelerating cost reduction across the company because that\u2019s the right thing to do in terms of the environment that we're living in.", "So that\u2019s how we think about it I feel excellent about the 350 and what I can say is that we never stop looking for synergies both on the revenue and cost side and while we don\u2019t use that language inside the company today we're still getting benefits from the combination of Thermo Fisher which happened seven years ago, right.", "So we don\u2019t call it a synergy but we talked about it as our customer value proposition we talked about it as our strength in emerging markets and we're constantly look for upsides.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.", "Okay. Thanks for that Marc. And Pete I want to take a I guess a more direct shot at following up on Derik FX question, I mean obviously none of us want to predict where rates are going, but if we look at current levels would you disagree that FX looks like about a 2% headwind at the top line and you know I guess that\u2019s first part.", "The second part would be, should we be thinking as far as through at a similar rate what we've done in the past or is it drastically different because of the life deal as you started to talk about.", "And then I guess the third part to this would be keeping in mine that you did talk about essentially powering through $0.07 of incremental headwinds in Q4. How should we think about your ability to power through even more intense headwinds of the FX line next year? Thank you.", "Pete Wilver", "So in terms of total revenue, so I you are looking at the $17 billion number its less than 2% its some where in the range of $1.5 but probably be a better number, I don\u2019t have the exact calculation in front of me, in term of pull-through its more then what it was for standalone, Thermo Fisher historically which was generally at the average pull through of the company because as you say when we add life technologies they have much more revenue in foreign currency primarily the euro and yen than they have cost. So we're exposed a little bit more there.", "In terms of our ability to get the power through and offset the whole thing in 2015 it\u2019s other scale that makes that very difficult. Obviously when we go to our planning process we'll be looking at that and determining what leverage we have to pull in terms of incremental restructuring, accelerating synergies just incremental productivity on all the normal things that we do PPI business system global sourcing the whole mix of what we have to attack those types of things. So as I said before we'll give you full view in January on what our plan is but it\u2019s a big impact to offset completely.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Company.", "Okay. Thanks, Pete.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "Good morning, guys. Thanks.", "Pete Wilver", "Hi, Isaac.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "Hi, If you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment have interested specifically in your comments around pricing and LPS and analytical technology?", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah, so in terms of pricing environment very similar to what we seen over the last few quarters price is slightly positive in terms of the environment in terms of the \u2013 products and services I would say pretty similar to the average of the company and in terms of analytical instruments generally pricing is been okay, we have such differentiation in most of our product lines and such high level of vitality where we only where price is just function of new products in a way its less so and then in a very competitive segments of in areas like maybe commodity material maybe pricing is a little bit more challenged but again positive pressure overall.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "Great. And then maybe in the OSS segment, could you talk a little bit more about the initiative you have in place to continue accelerate the organic growth profile versus what we saw before the acquisition and then maybe secondly for Pete as you talk little bit about how we should think about incremental margin opportunities across the very segments I would assume its high \u2013 so in a short terms asses given the synergies but just overall longer term period incremental margin by segment would be an interesting sort of general conversation to have?", "Marc Casper", "So in terms of what the team is executing on the growth side of the equation within Life Science Solutions, you know first of all independent the companies were independent and newest opportunities the revenue synergies right, so in the revenue synergies leverage our presence in emerging markets they leverage our corporate accounts and customer value proposition and the strong e-business capabilities for the two companies, right. So there is significant revenue synergies that start to generate next year and accelerate over time so that\u2019s one.", "Then in the base business excluding kind of revenue synergies within life science solutions you know we are focused on improving the impact of innovation that is clearly a big emphasis of the team. The Attune launch is a good example, we have efforts to accelerate growth in qPCR some interesting things that we're working on in the human identification area and forensic. So there is a number of things in the large installed base of very technically excellent products that we're working on you know really picking up the growth rate and then of course next gen sequencing is part of that as well and getting that business which is actually gone quite well to continue to strengthen its position and drive growth as well.", "Pete Wilver", "And then in terms of margins just at a very high level as you said life sciences solutions is going to benefit from both from synergies but of course they have regular margin expansion and productivity goals like all the other businesses. Analytical instruments we probably be second in terms of year-over-year margin expansion just based on the fact that obviously its all self manufactured products and its lower than the average margin for the company, especially diagnostics and next because this all self manufactured products as well expect for the healthcare channel and margin is relatively high, so its little bit higher to get margin expansion and then in laboratory products and services we have the impact of the channel so it\u2019s a little bit more difficult to expand margins year-over-year there.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs", "Got it. Thanks so much guys.", "Pete Wilver", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "", "Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Pete Wilver", "Good morning.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "I'd like to spend just a bit more time on China, maybe a couple there, one Marc when you see the recovery in China, where do you think it shares up what segments of the end market and as you think about how the business there grows in 2015, assuming that budget start flowing again later in the year, could we see a period of accelerated growth with easy comps or do we remain in a some what slower growth environment albeit and potentially better than we've seen in 2014?", "Marc Casper", "", "So, in terms of where we have the most exposure to China you would seen in the analytical instrument segment in terms of our presence there so that would be the beneficiary \u2013 the biggest beneficiary. In terms of 2015, obviously the comparison is going to be much easier next year versus the comparison we have next year so that\u2019s a positive factor we're still uncertain to know when the flow of funds is going to pick up so that one I had less visibility to. And so that will be some thing we have to think.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then one on instruments, the commentary coming out of the ASMS was very positive, the commentary on Vanquish has been optimistic if you look at that business and how its trending if you cold do this excluding the drag from China can you talk about whether you are seeing any organic pick up there as a function of the new products for this year and if not how you think that might emerge going forward? Thanks again.", "Marc Casper", "Yeah. So new products Mass-spec are doing very well so I feel good about that, we had a very strong American Society of Mass Spectrometry show, chromatography business is doing well, I look at the nine moths year-to-date in those businesses I feel good about the performance; in that segment you know we have large industrial exposure with our chemical analysis business particularly around mining and commodity materials which continues to be quite weak so I think that\u2019s somewhat reflected in the number. So if you take the other angle you say, outside of China how is our chrom and mass-spec business is doing, it\u2019s doing quite well. So I feel good about - that\u2019s different ones to think about it, it\u2019s doing quite well.", "Steve Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks, Marc.", "Marc Casper", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research", "", "Morning, thanks for taking my call. I just wondering if you could provide any thoughts you have regarding the competitive environment now with your acquisition of Life Tech obviously there is been some other large moves recently just wonder if you could provide what are thoughts are on the competitive environment and you know if there any impacts from Sigma-Aldrich being acquired now, on Thermo Fisher?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, I mean, we've in a consolidating industry we've been driving the consolidation and that trend continues. So that\u2019s something that we've been anticipating for a long period of time, its taken while for the industry consolidate and we expect that will continue to do so.", "There is still huge avenge of scale and you know there is huge avenge of \u2013 capabilities and we have a big, big hedge stars as the industry leader in terms of executing against it and we keep looking to strengthen our portfolio and do a great job serving our customers and we do that we feel we're very well positioned to grow our market share and strengthen our industry leadership position. So that\u2019s how would see it right now.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research", "", "Okay. And then just a little bit more of an near term question, a year ago it seems like the fourth quarter for many companies in the industry benefited from a year end budget flush to varying degrees and consequently you have a little bit more difficult comps here in the fourth quarter. Based on my math it looks like your guidance implies roughly kind of 3% to 5%, 5.5% organic growth in the fourth quarter. Just wondering you know what are your thoughts are and how you're going to be able to overcome the more difficult comps here in the fourth quarter versus what you've been experiencing so far this year?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, so in terms of the guidance for the fourth quarter, if you kind walk you away to the math which I obviously do real quick real time, its about 2% to 4% organic growth in the quarter that\u2019s the range which would then when you kind of do all the math which put you at the 3% to 4% for the company for the full year. So that\u2019s what implied in the guidance.", "Steve Willoughby - Cleveland Research", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Marc Casper", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W.

Baird.", "Okay. So all in number there. And then Marc just you've given some color on Naspac, I guess can you talk just about the kind of the high end business, not just the new instruments but overall high end Naspac what\u2019s the competitive environment there now?", "Marc Casper", "", "To exact to the fusion doing great, strong bookings from revenue, so we feel good about our position in terms of how we're doing at the high end we continue to bring out a stead stream new products and they are very received in the marketplace.", "Jeff Elliott - Robert W.

Thanks, guys.", "Marc Casper", "You're welcome.", "Pete Wilver", "Mellisa we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Dan Arias - Citigroup", "Hi, good morning guys. Thank you. Marc on the academic markets, can you just give a little bit more color on the extent to which the improvement that you know there was a year-over-year fact on easier compare whether you're really seeing some material spending pick up there just once you get a better feel for what the federally funded folks feeling?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, so academic and government Q3 was incredibly similar to Q2 so the North American environment or the US environment can was positive and the last two quarters was much better than the previous quarters. So you saw as we followed in the year that funding would flow through the systems it is you know it\u2019s robust but it\u2019s clearly its growing which is very good. The offset has been China \u2013 but now that is still low single digit growth I feel good that all for the end markets are back to a positive growth environment.", "Dan Arias - Citigroup", "Okay. Great. And then China, I you could just touch one additional point, last quarter you mentioned that even though the environment was difficult you felt good about not seeing order cancellations its fair to say but that\u2019s still the case this quarter and when the team looks out the next quarter or two that they feel good about what's in the books staying in book?", "Marc Casper", "Yeah, the environment is continuous to be consistent with that and the team is focused on turning those bookings into revenue.", "Dan Arias - Citigroup", "Very good. Thanks.", "Marc Casper", "Thank you. Let me wrap with a few thoughts, the first of which is 2015, we'll get into the guidance process as we normally do in January but let me make a couple of those comments so that because they kind of bit choppy in a way all the questions came out/ the first of which is you know if we were fast forwarding to the FX environment that we are in at this moment time sure that would be a headwind we're going to have some positives which is synergies will continue to ramp up we're going revenue synergies starting to flow and we'll be returning to capital deployment.", "The way that we will always judge the company is when we're sitting across with any of the member of the investment community are we managing the company extremely well and what ever the environment is and if we can answer that question and the investor would say yes you're managing the company extremely well, then that\u2019s really going to be the output of the financial goals we have for the year. So I feel like we'll get into all the details of it and we'll use the best information we have back in January to articulate that.", "From the perspective on the quarter that we just finished, you know, we have to be delivered strong quarter it puts us in excellent position to achieve the goals that we had set out for the year and we're excited about doing that and setting ourselves up for strong 2015 an of course thank you for all the support at Thermo Fisher and we look forward to coming back to you at the beginning of the year and reporting on our progress.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Pete Wilver, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website, thermofisher.com under the heading Webcast and Presentations until May 15, 2015.", "A copy of the press release of our 2015 first quarter earnings and future expectations is available on the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investor section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change, therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today. Also during the call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations, and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "Also before we get started, one other item to note is that the commentary that we're going to provide on the company's total organic revenue growth, as well as revenue growth by end market and by geography, now includes the performance of Life Technologies as of February 4, 2015, the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ken, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for our Q1 call. To summarize our performance this quarter, we delivered solid earnings growth. We launched a number of exciting new products, further strengthened our presence in emerging markets, and began to realize revenue synergies from combining our new capabilities. All of this creates even more value for our customers. At the same time, we took new cost actions to offset the additional FX headwinds that have occurred since our previous guidance. Based on these accomplishments, we remain well-positioned to deliver on our growth goals for the year.", "As usual, I'll begin with a financial summary and give you some color on our performance by end market, then I'll cover some of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on our synergies and then capital deployment, and wrap up with our current guidance outlook.", "So starting with the financials, our revenue in Q1 grew slightly to $3.92 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 3% to $857 million. We expanded our adjusted operating margin by 60 basis points to 21.9%, and we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.63, which is a 7% increase over Q1 last year. Our solid adjusted earnings per share growth is a result of the productivity that we always generate through our PPI Business System, and our ability to fully leverage our top line growth to drive bottom line performance.", "Looking at our growth performance by end market, although the environment in Europe had an overall dampening effect, what we saw in Q1 was generally in line with our expectations. The one exception was academic and government, which came in softer than we expected.", "So let me start there, with the academic and government end market, which declined in the low-single-digits during the quarter. This was driven primarily by Japan's well-publicized government budget delays, as well as a tough Q1 comp because of the consumption tax dynamic a year ago, which we had anticipated. We expect that the academic and government end market will be stronger in the balance of the year.", "Turning to industrial and applied, we grew here in the low-single-digits. Our businesses serving commodity materials markets continued to be soft, while those serving applied markets did very well, similar to what we've seen in this end market for a while. In particular, our chromatography business had another strong quarter.", "In diagnostics and healthcare, we grew in the low-single-digits during the quarter. We had good growth in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses, as well as our healthcare market channel.", "Last, in pharma and biotech, our performance here continues to be very solid, with strong mid-single-digit growth. Our BioProduction business delivered a particularly strong quarter. I've invested quite a bit of time in the past few months meeting with our pharma and biotech customers to get their feedback and better understand how we can partner in driving their innovation and productivity. Our value proposition is a key differentiator, and we continue to gain momentum here.", "Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter, which will show the great progress we've made to set ourselves up for a successful year. As you know, our key growth drivers are: developing innovative new products, expanding our presence in emerging markets, and leveraging our unique customer value proposition to gain share.", "So in terms of innovation, we have a lot to talk about here, but I'll focus on just a few of the new product launches from Q1. First, at Pittcon, we've been focused on our customers in applied markets and using our analytical instrument leadership to develop new Thermo Scientific products that are both powerful and easy to use.", "One of the most novel new products we introduced was our Gemini chemical analyzer. It combines FTIR and Raman technologies in a handheld unit that can identify unknown chemicals and explosives in the field. We have essentially redefined handheld instrumentation with a two-in-one analyzer that can be used by the military to protect troops, or by first responders to keep the public safe.", "We also continued to expand our industry-leading Orbitrap Mass Spec franchise by launching the Q Exactive LC-MS. This is a more powerful alternative to Q-TOF analysis for customers working in forensic toxicology, pharma QA/QC, or food and environmental testing. The advantage of the Q Exactive Focus is its ability to perform high-resolution, accurate mass analysis at a much lower price point than our other Orbitrap-based systems or competing Q-TOF technologies.", "Another highlight worth noting was that our customers who read SelectScience magazine voted Thermo Fisher, their Company of the Year, based on peer reviews and ratings. This award recognizes the strong customer allegiance we built through our leadership in analytical instruments.", "Separate from Pittcon, we launched a new personal monitor to protect miners from exposure to coal dust, which can cause black lung disease. The new generation PDM3700 delivers improved performance over our original unit, which was developed through a unique collaboration with government agencies, labor representatives and the mining industry.", "In laboratory equipment, we introduced a new ultra-low temperature freezer called the TSX, which is an advancement in both efficiency and sustainability. It runs on a natural refrigerant that uses 50% less energy than a conventional freezer and has less impact on the environment. The TSX is a great example of our commitment to helping our customers protect the integrity of their samples, while achieving their sustainability goals.", "The last product that I'll highlight is from our next-generation sequencing line and represents our latest development for advancing clinical research in oncology. Based on our Ion Torrent AmpliSeq technology, the RNA Fusion Lung Cancer Panel is a new tool for detecting gene mutations in very small tissue samples. This panel was confirmed by a consortium of leading clinical researchers from around the world, who are considered pioneers in colon and lung cancer research. I think these examples clearly demonstrate our commitment to innovation and to fulfilling our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer.", "Turning now to emerging markets. As highlighted in our press release, we made great progress here as well and we had good growth in China, South Korea and India during the quarter. We're pleased to report that China grew in the high-single-digits in Q1, strength in biopharma and healthcare led to a strong demand for our laboratory equipment, consumables and bioscience reagents. We also benefited from good growth in air and water quality monitoring. While this is not yet indicative of a trend, it's certainly going in the right direction.", "I traveled to China in late March to visit with our key customers and get a first-hand understanding of the local dynamics from our leadership team there. I came away very optimistic about our long-term prospects. We're seeing strong growth in products we make in China, which means our low-cost region manufacturing strategy is paying off. We also expect to launch several exciting new products this year that have been developed in our China Technology Center. As China prepares to announce its next five-year plan in early 2016, we're confident that Thermo Fisher will be in an excellent position to capture those opportunities and gain share.", "In other emerging markets, we also noted in our press release that we acquired two of our channel partners, one covering South Korea, the other covering Singapore and Malaysia. These channels increase our direct access to analytical instrument customers in Asia. We're also expanding our commercial presence in Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia with the opening of new sales offices, demonstrating our commitment to serving our customers across Southeast Asia.", "After acquiring the Singapore channel partner, we quickly integrated their operations in demo labs into our Marsiling facility there, which we built into a new Center of Excellence as part of the integration of our Life Science Solutions business. This is another example of the synergies we're creating as a result of the acquisition of Life Technologies with the goal of combining our capabilities in a way that strengthens our customer value proposition.", "Last quarter I mentioned that we began selling thousands of Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems branded products through our Fisher Scientific channel within our Lab Products and Services segment. I'm pleased to report that we're already seeing some incremental growth as a result of that. Just to give you a quick update on the acquisition synergies, we're off to a great start here as well. We began to see some of the revenue synergies kick in during Q1 and we're confident that we'll deliver the $60 million of revenue synergies we committed to this year.", "In terms of the cost synergies, for the full year, we now do expect to deliver $125 million of cost synergies, up from our previous guidance of $150 million this year. Pete will provide a bit more detail in his remarks.", "Before I turn to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we started to deploy capital immediately in 2015 buying $500 million of our stock in the first few weeks of the year. We have many opportunities ahead to create shareholder value by effectively deploying capital through a combination of stock buybacks, dividends and strategic M&A.", "On the topic of M&A, we spent $300 million in Q1 to acquire a nice bolt-on to our BioProduction capabilities, Advanced Scientific Inc., or ASI, which had $80 million of revenue in 2014 and offers customized single use systems and bioprocess equipment. These products complement our existing single use technologies. They strengthen our ability to help our life sciences and healthcare customers quickly develop high-quality low-cost solutions for their production of biologics.", "Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw in our press release, we're updating our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the impact of more unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates as well as stronger operating performance and the acquisition of ASI. We now expect revenue for the full year to be in the range of $16.67 billion to $16.83 billion. We're also raising the low-end of our adjusted EPS range by $0.03 to a new range of $7.25 to $7.40, which would result in 4% to 6% growth over 2014.", "Given the additional $0.09 of FX headwind in our guidance, I think it shows that we're managing in this environment very effectively. In addition to the productivity we always drive through our PPI Business System, last quarter we said, we'd take further actions if FX rates deteriorated. This was the case, so in Q1, we began implementing targeted price increases, putting more focus on gaining concessions from our supplier base and controlling costs more tightly.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, let me summarize my remarks by saying we performed well financially. We had another quarter of solid adjusted EPS growth. We continued to invest in a bright future by successfully executing our growth strategy, and last, the integration continues to go very well and we're on track to deliver our revenue and cost synergy targets. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to Pete.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Marc. Good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our Q1 financial performance for the total company then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance.", "As a reminder, at the total company level, we're reporting organic revenue growth using our standard methodology. That means that we've excluded the results of Life Technologies up to the one-year anniversary date of the acquisition, which was in early February. However, for the Life Sciences Solutions segment, we're continuing to provide organic revenue growth on a pro forma basis as if we had owned Life Technologies for all of 2014 and 2015 to give you more relevant insight into the growth performance of that segment.", "So starting with our overall financial performance, in the first quarter, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $1.63, which represents very strong underlying operating performance given a 10% headwind from FX. GAAP EPS was $0.96 in Q1, down 29% from $1.36 in the prior-year's quarter primarily as a result of the gain on divestitures in the prior year. On the top line, organic revenue growth was 2% this quarter and our reported revenue was flat year-over-year.", "Q1 reported revenue included 5% growth from acquisitions net of divestitures and a 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note that the components of the Q1 change in revenue did not sum due to rounding. We strengthened our backlog in the quarter with bookings more than 1% higher than revenue.", "Looking at our growth by geography, North America grew in the low-single-digits and Europe declined in the low-single-digits. Asia Pacific grew in the mid-single-digits with China growing high-single-digits. Also of note, Japan declined in the mid-single-digits as a result of government funding delays and a very strong growth in the prior year, as Marc mentioned. Rest of world grew in the low-single-digits.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 21.9%, up 60 basis points from Q1 last year despite a 60-basis-point headwind from FX. At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System as well as strong year-over-year contribution from cost synergies.", "Net acquisitions and divestitures were actually about 25 basis points dilutive in the quarter primarily as a result of picking up January results for Life Technologies, which were at a much lower margin than the company average for the quarter as expected.", "We realized $14 million of benefit from our restructuring actions in Q1 and we also realized incremental synergies of $48 million. From a quarterly phasing perspective, in 2015, Q1 benefits the most from year-over-year synergies because we had no synergies in January of last year compared to having a full-year 2014 run rate of synergies in January of this year.", "For the full year, we now expect cost synergies of $125 million, up $10 million from our previous guidance of $115 million primarily as a result of accelerating realization of head count and sourcing synergies.", "Revenue synergies during the quarter were $5 million with $2 million of adjusted operating income pull-through. We expect revenue synergies to accelerate through the year, so we're still on track to achieve our full-year 2015 guidance of $60 million in revenue synergies and $20 million of adjusted operating income pull-through.", "In Q1, we continued to make additional strategic investments primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.3% in Q1, up 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase was driven by the addition of Life Technologies as well as solid productivity across our businesses. Adjusted SG&A in Q1 was 23.2% of revenue, which is 10 basis points unfavorable to Q1 2014. The increase was primarily a result of the addition of Life Technologies, partially offset by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions.", "Finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue, 40 basis points above the same quarter last year. This increase reflects the impact of that relatively higher level of R&D investment in the Life Sciences Solutions segment. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was about 6.5%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q1 was $101 million, down $4 million from last year, primarily as a result of paying down our debt balance versus the prior year. We also restructured some of our debt during the quarter to lower our interest cost, which was included in the previous guidance. Adjusted other income for Q1 was $7 million, which was $5 million higher than Q1 2014, driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, 200 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning.", "We spent $500 million in January to buy back 3.9 million of our shares and we returned an additional $61 million of capital through dividends in the quarter. Average diluted shares were 401.4 million in Q1, up 3 million or 1% from last year, primarily as a result of the shares we issued to partially fund the Life Technologies acquisition, along with some option dilution, partially offset by the share buybacks.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations in Q1 was $82 million and free cash flow was negative $15 million, after deducting net capital expenditures of $97 million. This compares to $1 million of free cash flow in Q1 2014. Compared to the prior year, we picked up about $300 million of non-repeating \u2013 from not repeating the acquisition-related payments that you may recall we made last year, which was offset by the timing of interest and tax payments, as well as normalization of Life Technologies into our Q1 results.", "We ended the quarter with $870 million in cash and investments, down $480 million sequentially from Q4 2014. The decrease was driven by our capital deployment on share buybacks, the ASI acquisition, and dividends.", "Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $14.9 billion, up $300 million from Q4 2014, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We continue to expect to achieve our target leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times by the end of 2015.", "So let me wrap up my comments on the total company with my usual update on our performance in terms of return on invested capital. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q1 2015 was 8.9%, down 60 basis points from Q4 2014. This is in line with our expectations and as a result of adding another full quarter of Life Technologies investment into our five-quarter average invested capital, while only adding an incremental month of Life Technologies earnings. The acquisition impact is now fully in our invested capital base and we expect ROIC to increase steadily for the remainder of the year.", "So with that, now I'll walk you through the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, FX was a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and negatively impacted their year-over-year revenue growth to varying degrees. We also had one less day in the quarter, which mainly affected our consumables-oriented businesses.", "Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, in Q1, total revenue grew to $1.02 billion from $840 million in the prior year, primarily as a result of the Life Technologies acquisition, net of the related divestitures. On a pro forma basis, assuming Life Technologies was owned in both periods, organic revenue grew 2%.", "In the quarter, we saw strong growth in our BioProduction business, partially offset by some weakness in academic, government, and applied markets. Q1 adjusted operating income for Life Sciences Solutions increased significantly, primarily as a result of the acquisition, and adjusted operating margin was 29.3%, flat with the prior year, consistent with our expectations. In the segment, we had very strong productivity, including acquisition synergies, and good pull-through on incremental organic revenue. This was offset by unfavorable FX and dilution from the incremental acquisition revenue which, as I mentioned earlier, represented January results and pull-through a much lower-than-average margin for the segment.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 6% in Q1, and organic revenue grew 1%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography business, which was partially offset by weakness in academic and government and some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in the Analytical Instruments decreased 7% and adjusted operating margin was 16.7%, down 30 basis points. In the segment, we delivered very strong productivity that was more than offset by strategic growth investments and some unfavorable business mix.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment in Q1, total revenue decreased 4% and organic growth was 3%. As Marc mentioned, our clinical diagnostics, immunodiagnostics, and healthcare channel businesses had good growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 27.3%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong productivity and good pull-through on organic growth, partially offset by strategic growth investments and FX.", "Finally, in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue declined 5%, driven by FX and the Cole-Parmer divestiture. On an organic basis, revenue grew 3%. Our research and safety channel showed particular strength, benefiting from good growth with biopharma customers. Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, flat with the prior year. This was driven by strong productivity offset by unfavorable business mix, the Cole-Parmer divestiture, and FX.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full-year 2015 guidance. In terms of adjusted EPS, with a solid quarter behind us, we're raising the low-end of our 2015 adjusted EPS guidance by $0.03 to a new range of $7.25 to $7.40, which represents growth of 4% to 6% versus 2014. To bridge the $0.015 increase to the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we're seeing an incremental $0.09 headwind from FX, which we're more than offsetting with $0.035 below the line from other income and a slightly lower share count, $0.02 from the ASI acquisition, and $0.05 of operational improvements, including incremental cost synergies.", "On the top line, as a result of the deteriorating FX environment, we're lowering both the high and low end of our reported revenue range, partially offset by the addition of the ASI acquisition. This leads to a new full-year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.67 billion to $16.83 billion, which is down slightly compared to our reported revenue of $16.89 billion in 2014. To bridge the $150 million decline from the midpoint of our previous guidance, we're expecting an additional $240 million headwind from more unfavorable foreign exchange rates, offset by about $90 million of incremental revenue from acquisitions.", "To summarize the impact of FX on our current guidance, on the top line, FX is now lowering our revenue by about $985 million, or 6%, so our reported growth guidance would be 5% to 6% on a FX-neutral basis. In terms of adjusted EPS, FX is now $0.67 headwind or 10% year-over-year. So if you were to look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 14% to 16%, which represents even stronger underlying operating performance than our previous guidance.", "Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions net of divestitures are expected to contribute about 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015. On an organic basis, there's no change to our organic growth guidance midpoint of about 4%. And consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. Our guidance also does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to adjusted operating margin, we're expecting 60 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year. This is up 10 basis points from both the low and high end of our previous guidance primarily as a result of stronger operating performance.", "In terms of the adjusted operating margin pull-through on the incremental FX revenue headwind, we're seeing an additional $40 million of unfavorable impact on the bottom line, bringing the total impact to $315 million or 65 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. So on an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be very strong at 130 basis points to 150 basis points.", "Moving below the line, we're still expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million although the ASI acquisition pushed us slightly higher into the range. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14% consistent with our previous guidance.", "In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks, which we completed in January.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 402 million to 403 million, about the same as 2014 and down about 1 million shares from our previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million, which is unchanged from our previous guidance and for full-year 2015 free cash flow, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion consistent with prior guidance.", "As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as FX fluctuations during the year.", "In summary, we had a number of significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us well to achieve our financial goals for the year.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Pete. Melissa, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question is from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Hey. Good morning and congratulations on another solid quarter. So, Marc, would you mind just, I guess, obviously, one of the big questions is going to be on the low-single-digit 2% organic revenue growth. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about your conviction that that growth rate improves a little throughout the year? You mentioned you thought academic and government would get a little bit better. And can you also maybe talk about some of your more specific plans to offset FX? I know you mentioned some on the cost side, but is there anything you're doing in terms of pricing? And how are you finding the pricing environment? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jon, thanks for the questions. So, yeah, let's start kind of with the holistic view, right, for organic growth. The key takeaways we feel very comfortable with the 4% organic growth guidance for the full year that we set off back in the beginning of February and we feel good about that today. When you think about the quarter, if you recall back to early February, we said that this would be in the range of 2% to 4% organic growth and primarily so lower in the first quarter and builds as the year goes on, primarily because of the calendar day difference, right, so we anticipated that.", "When we look at the performance of the quarter, really the only big change was Japan didn't approve its budget during the quarter that got approved, I think, on April 9. So that's back in place. Europe was a little weaker, but China was a little bit stronger. So there were puts and takes. But I felt like the quarter played out within the range of what we expected. Looking forward, so why do we have real good confidence in the 4% organic growth? Straightforward, bookings were very good in the quarter, so that was favorable to revenue.", "We saw a lot of activity and a lot of interest very late in the quarter as well. So the funnels look good. When I look at the products that we've launched and the product pipeline that we have coming up for the balance of the year, it looks outstanding. So we have a lot of growth driven from that. The early funnels on revenue synergies built nicely in the quarter and that puts us in a position to drive revenue synergies. So when I look at the full year, we're in a good spot to deliver the 4% organic growth.", "In terms of foreign exchange, one of the key messages on the last call, Jon, was what would happen if foreign exchange rates change back as of February 1. And we said that if rates got better, we would let that flow to the bottom line. If rates got worse, we would try to take actions to offset as much as we possibly could. Rates clearly got worse in the quarter, as Pete highlighted in his remarks.", "Just focusing on the EPS side of the equation, there was a $0.09 incremental headwind. And our teams really were very focused on putting additional actions that give us confidence that we can offset those headwinds and deliver an even better outlook on EPS for the year. Part of that is some very targeted price increases in those markets where foreign exchange has been a factor and where there's not a lot of domestic competition, domestic meaning local competition in those markets. So Japan would be an example that we have some very targeted price increases. And while it's early to know exactly how it's all working out, pricing was relatively good in the first quarter.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a million.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hey, guys.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "So I'd like to stick on Jon's theme on the core. So you mentioned that booking's pacing towards the end of the quarter kind of gave you some confidence that the ability to hit the 4% target was still on track. And so as you look at that, I don't know what's the right way to cut it, Marc, by geography or by end market? Where did you see the biggest inflection over the course of the quarter?", "Because as we look at some of the PMIs and we look at some of the other industry commentary, it's a little bit different than sort of what you saw in the business and so we're just trying to mix-and-match. And by that I mean Europe seems a little bit better and maybe China, the service seems a little bit worse. And so we're trying to make sense of what you saw bookings versus what the market overall macro is seeing.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Ross, Europe improved clearly as the quarter went on. Very, very slow start at the beginning of the year and improved. So that was a positive. China, as I mentioned, I was in China in March. Generally, the team from the beginning of the quarter right to where it finished felt that they were going to deliver high-single-digit growth and they did, right. So we didn't see much of, I'd say, change in activity level, meaning, it was a better quarter, but the team saw it and it was consistent throughout. And so China was a little bit better, it's a little early to call a trend there, but we didn't see China deteriorate at the end of the quarter or anything like that based on the data you're referring to. So those are the two factors. Europe got better and China was good.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Got it. And maybe big picture. You talked about sort of M&A. So I was listening to my company's conference call before I jumped on this one and Roger Altman talked about sort of the trend in the market right now as maybe deal volumes are lower, but dollar volumes are higher. So we're seeing a lot more larger transactions. As you think about this space, it's actually been the opposite. I mean, other than Sigma, we really haven't seen much activity. I mean, in general, are you kind of surprised about what you're seeing in the pipeline? You're able to get there on the ASI, which looks like a really good deal. But as you think about where your leverage is going, you obviously have some firepower there. How are you thinking about the trade-off of what may be available versus where valuations are versus sort of what other opportunities you have?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So great question. In terms of the capital deployment side of the equation, we have an active pipeline of transactions. We always do and we do currently. So we're looking at things. And as you know, we like to look at everything. But at the same point, we are very selective in what we actually do. And as long as something solidly meets our criteria of strengthening the company strategically, clearly, being understood and adding value for our customers and creating shareholder value, then we'll pursue those things.", "So I like what the funnel looks like, but you got to drive things through the funnel. ASI was a nice acquisition. We did two tiny little things in the channel to strengthen our commercial capabilities, and we're looking at a number of other things. So in terms of your bigger question about sort of the space, the bigger transactions, they happen, but they don't happen very frequently. And when they do, we usually will take a look, but they don't occur with a lot of frequency.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks, Marc.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Morning, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So just to clarify your China comment, you said you're seeing some improvement. Is that still mostly lower-end lower-priced products, i.e., chromatography as opposed to pushing the higher-end mass spec? Just a little bit more color just sort of given some of the anti-corruption activities and stuff that were going on in the past?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Derik, if you look at China and you saw a clear increase in, what I'd say, your run rate activity, your bioscience reagents, your lab equipment, your lab consumables, those types of businesses, were very improved, meaning, that customers have money, they're spending it, activity is good. The bigger ticket items clearly continue to be muted. And that affected clearly our Analytical Instruments business. Chrome was quite strong, but things like mass spec were clearly affected by a tighter budget and more scrutiny, if you will, by the government.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's very helpful. And just one follow-up. On Specialty Diagnostics, we were expecting a little bit higher number there. We're expecting a little bit more tailwind from flu and some other things. Could you talk about what you sort of saw in the diagnostics space globally? And just sort of the push and pulls in that business?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think when you look at the result in diagnostics, the one day difference probably is your biggest factor from...", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "...what you would think from the other things. So I actually look at the underlying fundamentals or how the business performed, it's actually pretty solid; so not much there. We got a tiny benefit from seasonal, pollen season in Japan was slightly worse, so the net of seasonal was just slightly better in aggregate.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks very much. I'll get back in the queue.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Just want to follow up on some of the questions around guidance. And just so we're clear on what you're embedding now for Japan, now that we're through the March fiscal year, are you assuming a recovery here in the second quarter? And maybe just, you could quantify your overall expectations for the year in Japan?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So what we're expecting in Japan is that you'll see growth return back to a more normalized level. And typically, we assume kind of low-single-digit growth in Japan is kind of the baseline assumption. We've actually had performance better than that in the past, but that's the baseline assumption. So, just given the timing of where the budget was, we would expect growth to start to normalize back to the traditional growth rates.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, following up on a question on China a minute ago, I think you're still cautious about calling any sort of inflection, but obviously high-single-digit growth this quarter. Can you maybe just give us a sense of what could get you closer to high-single-digit growth versus mid-single-digit growth guidance for the year in China? Are there specific catalysts we should be paying attention to, or is it just...", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, the team is clearly working towards that objective, right. So all of our colleagues, 4,000 colleagues, that's what they're driving towards. But they don't control sort of the government environment, right. So there's \u2013 the reason we just didn't put a hard-line type commitment to it is that, it is variable what the environment is. But clearly after a few very challenging quarters, we saw some nice bright spots. And if we can line up two or three quarters like that in a row, then that clearly would be a trend. So that's what the team is focused on. It's just executing well.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then just lastly on BioProduction, you called it out as an area of strength. You obviously did the ASI bolt-on. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you're expecting for that business this year, and your visibility around that business?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So BioProduction, market-leading position in media and sera through our Gibco range of products, in a very strong position, and single-use technologies through the Thermo Scientific and ASI set of products. That will be a very fast-growing business for us. It is a double-digit type growth business for Thermo Fisher. INTERPHEX is going on right now. I know the early feedback is very positive on our range of capabilities, in terms of what we show to our customer base there.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Steve.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "First off, Pete, I just want to say thanks for all your help over the last year. Thank you so much. And we'll miss you on the calls.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then for Marc, I guess I'll ask a question on China. Sorry for asking the fourth or fifth of these. But taking a longer-term view, Marc, you made some interesting comments about the longer-term outlook in China, specifically how you are thinking about the impact of the new five-year plan and your positioning for relative share there, given your positioning there as a local manufacturer. Be really interesting just to hear you expound upon those comments, to think about maybe the 24-month view for the market there?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Steve, a couple of things. One is, we've been in China for 30-plus years. And one of the things that helps the company get successful is anticipating the changes in the environment to continue to be out in front of them so that you can benefit from the evolution of the economy. Our assumption is, and this is not a bold statement, is that GDP growth will be more moderate in China than what it had been in the previous five years.", "And because of that, there's going to be a more emphasis on jobs in China and therefore, we've made a big commitment to manufacturing in China, having a very strong R&D presence, having great talent out of the best universities so that when we're meeting with the government and talking about initiatives for growth, they're seeing the brightest Chinese people that work for Thermo Fisher actually saying why we want to push forward these environmental applications, these food safety regulations, these sequencing applications, and that puts us in a great position to compete. And as we look to the development of the next five-year plan, we feel like we'll be incredibly well positioned to capitalize on that.", "Our goal is always to have very strong growth in China. We've invested a lot there. And the exact details of it we always give each year in our guidance, but it should be a double-digit type growth market for us for a long period of time.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Much appreciated. And then, I'm not sure if this is for Marc or for Pete, but just in the interest of completeness, given all the questions out there in the industrial channel, I'd say I take your comments about the cadence of growth through the quarter, with it being strong in March, is to suggest there's no knock-on impact, or sign of any knock-on impact, from what we've seen in oil and gas CapEx. Is that a fair assessment, or is there more nuance to it? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So what I would say is that clearly, the oil and gas end markets are soft. But they're very, very, very small for us, right. So there's some effect, but it doesn't hit any level of materiality to the company. So that's how I think about that. And you can just kind of lump it into the commodities material markets are soft, and oil and gas is soft, but there is nothing much to spend \u2013 dwell in there. And generally, industrial and applied should be a reasonable market for us this year.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just wanted to see if I could understand the comments on academic and government. Marc, does the softness that you saw there pertain mostly to Japan, or is that something that showed up in the U.S. and Europe, too? Just a little bit clarification there if you could.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So Japan was the primary driver, right. So we had been growing in the low-single-digits last year. We declined in the low-single-digits. The full delta between sort of flat and the decline was driven by Japan, maybe the difference between flat and the rest was just a little bit of softness that we saw in Europe. So that would be the academic and government story, really is a Japan story.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. And then just maybe going back to capital deployment and following up on Ross' M&A question, I guess, in general, when you think about the candidates or the targets that are in your pipeline and sort of the mid to smaller size of things, I mean, are the majority of them on the private side? Are you actually finding a handful of public assets that are interesting, too?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I mean, this industry is mostly private companies, right, in terms of the number of companies, right. So there's a huge pipeline of those. We continue to look at those closely and every once in a while you'll see us be able to get one over the goal line.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks very much.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Doug. Doug, you're on mute?", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I'm on mute. Sorry about that. Talking to myself again.", "All right. So thanks for taking the questions, guys. So my first question and this has been asked, I guess, in different forms. But just to be pretty direct about this, you guys came in at the low-end of your organic revenue growth guidance for the first quarter. This came after Q4 growth that was much stronger than most of us expected. In hindsight, was there some pull-forward of revenue into Q4 at the expense of Q1? And if so, in what geographies and end markets was this most notable and was this not apparent to you until the very back end of the quarter?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Doug, interestingly enough, if you think about what happened a year ago and what happened this year, you have similar patterns. Very, very strong finish to the year and then a softer Q1. And Pete when he laid out the guidance said, Q1 will be a little bit softer than the balance of the year. And what I would say the dynamic is, if you think about what happened in both of those years, nothing really bad happened in the world. And one of those calls, you heard me say this, right. Customers keep a certain level of money on the side to manage for a disaster, right.", "In both 2013 and 2014, the way the world ended, things were okay. So people release funds very late in the year. That dynamic does the following, which is if you want to buy something exciting and expensive you buy it, but sometimes if you have a little extra money, you wind up buying something you absolutely know you're going to need, right. And so I'm sure that some high-tech consumables, bioscience reagents, if people had a little bit of money they bought a little bit knowing that they'd use in the first quarter. Does that have a tiny bit of an effect? Sure. But is it something worth calling out? No, is the way I would think about it.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And this is very short-term focused, but recognizing it is a quarterly call, I think it's important to ask the question. I'm a bit surprised that you guys have called out Japan academic government as a source of weakness relative to what you expected in the quarter. A lot of what you described seems like it should have been embedded in your expectations.", "Just to be clear, I mean, was Japan really worse than what you had embedded into expectations? And if not, where else was academic government weak? I mean, you point a slight weakness in Europe beyond your expectations, but it doesn't sound like there's anything real notable there. I just want to make sure there's nothing that would suggest there's particular areas where maybe you were a bit weaker than expected from a competitive standpoint.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Doug, I guess, a couple ways I would think about that. One is, Japan not a huge market for us, right, in aggregate, top five, top six market, but not a huge market, accounted for the whole academic and government about a little more than a 3% decline for the company, right, in the quarter. So it gives you a sense of how soft it was. There were two factors, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, one which we clearly understood and embedded in our guidance, which was a very challenging comparison in Japan because of the consumption tax last year, which had customers pull things forward.", "Not having the budget pass until after the quarter end, I don't think it was \u2013 from everything I've read from the team that we've worked with for many, many years, was not something that they anticipated nor, as far as I can tell, was really expected. So that's the difference in the performance, right. So I don't know maybe other people saw that happening and we missed it, but from my understanding, I think we planned it appropriately and that's the way it played out.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Last one real quick. The LSS pro forma growth, I believe, was 7% in Q4 that moderated to, I think, 2% this quarter. I think you had previously provided Life Tech guidance for this year that was above your long-term goal. Does that remain unchanged after Q1?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes. So basically, the segment played out pretty much the same story as the company, right, 2% growth in the quarter versus 3% to 4% for the segment for the full year. We feel good about the 3% to 4% for the segment for the full year. I'll spend some time talking about that at the Analyst Meeting coming up, which I believe is May 20. So mark the date. And Ken's happy, he's smiling that I'm doing a plug for that. But, yeah, nothing has changed in terms of our outlook for Life Sciences Solutions segment.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning. Thanks. Just a couple cleanups for me. Could you maybe, Pete, give us a sense of the impact to gross margin in terms of the FX headwind, just how much of a headwind that was?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So in terms of gross margin, it's about 45 basis points year-over-year, negative.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Right, right. Okay. Thanks. And then just another question on BioProduction, if we just kind of look at the competitive landscape, it seems like three out of the four players there or major players all seem like they had pretty good quarters like really strong actually. So I'm wondering if there's a sense at the market there is inflecting and if so, why? Obviously, there's been a lot of momentum in biotech with new biologics and funding, but just curious about what's actually going on in the underlying level, because it seems like everyone there is growing strong double-digits.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think you have the combination of drug approvals, biosimilars and vaccines. That combination of those three are really driving substantial growth in that market.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And is it fair to say that will kind of progress throughout the course of the year at the current pace?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I would say that it should be a strong end market for a number of years ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Isaac.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks and good morning. I want to ask just around healthcare utilization maybe for the clinical lab, part of the Lab Products and Services business. Just curious what you're seeing there within the 3% organic growth that you put up seeing some signs from HCA put up a good quarter and some of that, I think, is optics, but just really around utilization and your thoughts there.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So in terms of the diagnostics and healthcare, I think U.S. was generally okay in terms of utilization. You still have the pattern, which is incredibly exaggerated meaning that it's now the lowest. That set of activity is Q1 and it builds steadily as people meet their deductible limits during the course of the year. But I think that pattern is roughly normalizing. So you have low level activity, but your growth rates are somewhat similar throughout the quarters. I mean, it's basically what's going on. So nothing dramatic to note in Q1 in terms of utilization.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then just the last one. And leaning sort of into the FX with the cost synergies coming up a little bit for life through year end, I was just curious if it changed your thoughts at all around what you viewed as being the three-year opportunity around what you could potentially earn on that side?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "In terms of the three-year outlook, we're still holding to the $300 million of cost synergies and $50 million of pull-through on revenue synergies.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Next question is from the line of Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.", "Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Pete, just with the FX impact, has that made you to think differently about hedging programs or degree of natural hedging or the debt structure?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Well, we obviously we put in some euro debt last year, which helps a little bit. We're actually seeing a little bit of below the line impact from that. Part of the synergy actions that we're putting in place is trying to convert some of our suppliers to local currency to improve our natural hedging position. We don't have a ton of that. But we are out of sync in a few geographies. So we're working on that. In terms of just regular overall hedging program, we don't intend to put anything in place with regard to that.", "Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "And is there any change in the debt paydown strategy? I'm wondering if you could just talk to the targets again?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No. We haven't changed our strategy on debt paydown. We're shooting to get down to about between $12 billion and $12.5 billion by the end of the year. That gets us in just below the 3 range so back in our target leverage ratio range.", "Peter R. Lawson - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Melissa, we're going to take one more question.", "Operator", "Your last question is from the line of Paul Knight from Janney Capital. Your line is open.", "Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "Hi, Marc. Convenient INTERPHEX yesterday looking at your products, the question is where are you with the API (sic) [ASI] (59:37) acquisition and the integration of it?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So in terms of \u2013 Paul, thanks for the question. In terms of the ASI, we closed in February. I had a great opportunity to meet the team there and the integration is going very smoothly. Very complementary to our existing single-use technologies, it brings some new product range as well in terms of connectors, which is an important step in the workflow and gives our customers the choice now of the second film, which for certain biologics would be very useful for them. So it gives us a more complete offering, which we very much value.", "Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "So...", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Go ahead, Paul.", "Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "On the consolidation within the biological production market, is there much left to do in that market? Is it fragmented or not fragmented in your view?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's a lot of competitors still out there. So for sure there's quite a competitive landscape. And we have our niches of strength, others have theirs. And so it's an area with great market growth and we have great competitive position, but there's quite a few different companies there out in the landscape.", "Paul R. Knight - Janney Capital Markets", "Great. You seemed excited there. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Paul, thanks. So let me wrap it up. We feel good about our accomplishments in Q1. We are in a great position to deliver another strong year and, of course, we look for to updating you on our progress next quarter and seeing you in New York City later in May.

Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 28, 2015 under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available in the Investor section of our website under the heading, SEC filings.", "While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also, during this call we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our second quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investor section of our website under the heading Financial Information. So with that, I'd now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Ken, and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q2 call. As you saw in our press release, we had an excellent quarter. Financially we delivered strong growth on both the top and bottom line. Operationally our team executed very well and we gained share with our customers. Strategically we continue to execute our growth plans with significant new product launches, good progress in emerging markets, and many examples again this quarter that demonstrate how our unique value proposition is resonating with our customers.", "We also announced a nice bolt-on acquisition near quarter end, which is an example of how we're continuing to deploy capital to create shareholder value. I'll touch on all these achievements beginning with the financial summary and my end market commentary, then I'll cover some of the business highlights from the quarter and close with our updated guidance for the year.", "So beginning with the financials. Our revenues in Q2 were $4.27 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 3% to $950 million. We had good expansion in our adjusted operating margin, which increased 90 basis points to 22.3% and we delivered adjusted EPS of $1.84, which is a 7% increase over Q2 of last year.", "We fully leveraged our top line growth while continuing to effectively manage the business to offset the FX headwind. The power of our PPI Business System continues to contribute meaningfully to our earnings growth.", "Let me now put our growth in the context of our end markets. First in academic and government, we saw a good improvement in Q2 as we expected after a soft Q1. Growth here returned to a low single digits.", "We were encouraged that the proposed increase in NIH funding continues to move forward. While it's not likely to have any near-term impact, if enacted it would certainly be a real positive down the road.", "In industrial and applied, we didn't see much change with growth in the low single digits in Q2. Our core industrial businesses remain soft while our businesses serving applied markets continued to do well. In particular, we had a very strong quarter in chromatography with high demand for our HPLC and GC products.", "Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, also not much change here. Conditions in this end market were similar to what we saw in Q1, and we grew in the low single digits. The key contributors to our growth again this quarter were our Clinical Diagnostics and ImmunoDiagnostics businesses. Last, our performance in pharma and biotech was very strong and we grew in the mid-teens in Q2. Given our significant strength here, I want to give you a bit more color on this end market.", "We believe our performance was driven by a combination of three factors. First, we continue to capitalize on the strong market conditions that we're seeing, especially in biotech. Second, we're effectively leveraging our customer value proposition across our businesses, and that accelerated our excellent growth momentum in this end market. And third, the actions we've taken as part of the integration have fundamentally strengthened the growth trajectory of our BioSciences and BioProduction businesses. The revenue synergies are also starting to ramp up and beginning to contribute to our growth.", "Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. We made great progress to set ourselves up for another successful year. As you know, our growth strategy is centered around three things: our leadership in developing high-impact technology innovation, the advantages we have because of our scale in emerging markets, and our ability to leverage our unique customer value proposition to gain share.", "Starting with innovation, we followed a very productive Q1 with another quarter of significant new product launches, which strikes me is the incredible progress we're making in developing new tools with the potential to have a significant impact on the way our customers identify and treat disease.", "This is a very exciting time and Thermo Fisher is playing a key role in meeting some of healthcare's greatest challenges. Let me give you a few examples from the quarter. First, you all know that the American Society of Mass Spectrometry Conference is an important venue for us and always presents the opportunity to reinforce our mass spec leadership. This year we celebrated our tenth anniversary of the original Orbitrap. It's as much of a game changer in proteomics today as it was back then, and we continue to build on our leadership.", "Our latest Orbitrap development is the new Fusion Lumos Tribrid system, which we launched at ASMS to expand our Fusion portfolio. With Lumos, we've improved the two fundamental aspects of system performance that are most important to proteomics researchers. One is intact protein analysis, which allows scientists to perform more comprehensive protein characterization. The other is sensitivity, which is now three to five times greater than the previous Orbitrap systems.", "During the quarter the Gladstone Institutes at the University of California, San Francisco, opened a Thermo Fisher Scientific Proteomics facility. Scientists there are using our Orbitrap and triple quad technologies to better understand the interactions between genes and the proteins they produce. The goal of this collaboration is to better understand human biology to more effectively target and cure disease.", "In response to requests from our customers to manage, analyze and share the massive volumes of data generated by this kind of research, we also announced at ASMS that we've extended our Thermo Fisher Cloud platform to support proteomics. This new capability complements our existing cloud platforms for Sanger sequencing and qPCR, connecting scientists, instruments and software in a collaborative multi-disciplined environment.", "Another highlight from ASMS was our new Q Exactive GC-MS/MS system, which is the first instrument to combine gas chromatography with high resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry. This significantly increases productivity for life science researchers, as well as customers working in anti-doping and food safety laboratories by bringing high sensitivity applications to those traditionally served by GC-MS.", "Turning to AACR, the annual meeting of cancer researchers in the U.S., we extended our QuantStudio portfolio by launching two new real time PCR systems, the QuantStudio 3 and QuantStudio 5. These new products are part of our efforts to accelerate growth in our PCR franchise.", "At the annual meeting of clinical oncologist called ASCO, we announced our participation in a national clinical trial being run by the National Cancer Institute. The NCI-MATCH Program expects to enroll 1,000 patients across the U.S. in a trial that will sequence genetic information to match these patients with the most effective treatments. Medical facilities in the network will use our Oncomine panel and reagents as well as our Ion Torrent system to sequence as many as 3,000 cancer samples. This is potentially ground-breaking work that is being made possible by our NextGen sequencing technologies which are ideally suited to this targeted panel approach to oncology.", "One final comment on innovation, we added new state-of-the-art capabilities at our BioProduction facility in the UK for the manufacture of our proprietary dry powder media. This unique granulated formula has all the benefits of traditional liquid media without the associated storage and transportation costs. This format simplifies cell culture production and is used in a range of drugs including an increasing number of cancer therapeutics.", "Turning to the second element of our growth strategy, emerging markets. First, I want to mention that we returned to double-digit growth in China this quarter, growing in the mid-teens, which is encouraging.", "Next, I wanted to spend a few minutes on a region that we don't talk as much about, the Middle East. This is a relatively underpenetrated market for us, and in May we opened our first customer experience center in Dubai. This facility showcases a wide range of our technologies, from centrifugation to mass spectrometry and genetic sequencing. We provide training there for researchers, healthcare providers and educational institutions, as well as food and beverage companies. We also plan to collaborate with local universities to train aspiring scientists in the region.", "The Middle Eastern countries represent a good long-term opportunity for us because they're investing heavily in research, healthcare, food safety, and environment. As we've done successfully in other emerging markets, our strategy here is to increase our direct commercial presence starting with demo and application labs like the one in Dubai. We use this as foundation for building strategic partnerships, and I'm encouraged by the progress we've made so far.", "The third element of our growth strategy is our customer value proposition. And a great example of how we're effectively delivering it is the growth we're driving within our life science solutions business. As I mentioned in my end market commentary, we are fully leveraging the capabilities of both companies BioSciences and BioProduction businesses as part of our integration plan. Our team has done a fantastic job of combining our offerings here in a way that really resonates with these customers and drives growth. Customers are also increasingly seeing the benefit of being able to buy Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems branded products through our research market channel, and we're seeing some nice incremental growth as a result of that as well.", "Just to give you a quick update on where we are relative to our synergy targets, we've made great progress on the revenue synergies in Q2 and built on the momentum we had early in the year. As we said last quarter, we expect the revenue synergies to ramp up as the year unfolds.", "We're at $25 million or the halfway point which puts us right on track to meet or exceed the $60 million in revenue synergies for the full year. In terms of cost synergies, we now expect to deliver $130 million of cost synergies in 2015, which is a $5 million increase over what we discussed last quarter.", "Before I move on to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. At the end of the June we announced our agreement to acquire Alfa Aesar, a leading provider for research chemicals for approximately $400 million. This is a complementary bolt-on that strengthens our research chemicals offering, and we expect to complete the acquisition by year-end.", "The pending Alfa Aesar acquisition is another example of our strategy to effectively deploy capital. If you look at where we are at the halfway point, we bought back $500 million of our stock at the beginning of the year, we've deployed $300 million to acquire Advanced Scientifics in Q1, we've committed approximately $400 million to acquire Alfa Aesar and we pay a quarterly dividend. In total, we're on track to deploy approximately $1.4 billion this year to create value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw on our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance to reflect the impact of current foreign currency exchange rates as well as strong operating performance. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $16.72 billion to $16.86 billion and we are also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $7.28 to $7.41. This will be a 5% to 6% growth over our strong results in 2014.", "Given our decision to raise both revenue and earnings guidance, it's clear that we're executing well and we are in a strong position going into the back half the year. So in summary, it was a great quarter. We delivered strong performance, we made excellent progress in executing our growth strategy and we continued to put our money to work to create shareholder value.", "Before I turn the call over to Pete, as you probably know, this is his last earnings call. Pete has made tremendous contributions in defining and executing our growth strategy during his 11 years as CFO. He also did a great job of preparing his successor, Stephen Williamson to take on this important role. Stephen and I have worked together very closely for a long time and I am looking forward to partnering with him as he takes on the reigns as our CFO on August 1.", "That said, Pete is extremely committed to Thermo Fisher and has graciously accepted my offer to reconsider his retirement in March 2016 to take on a new role outside of finance. He will serve in a newly created position of executive vice president and chief administrative officer. In capacity, Pete will have responsibility for overseeing some of our corporate functions, which will help me devote more of my time to our customers. Pete is an extremely talented and valued member of the team, so I'm pleased that we'll continue to benefit from his deep knowledge of the company and his leadership.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Pete.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Marc. I appreciate your kind words and I'm very excited about my next chapter with Thermo Fisher. With that, let's move on to the numbers. As usual, I'll begin with an overview of our total company Q2 financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance.", "As you can see from our results, we had a very strong second quarter and delivered a solid first half. In the second quarter we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $1.84. This represents very strong underlying operating performance, given that we had a 12% headwind from FX in the quarter. GAAP EPS was $1.27 in Q2, up significantly from $0.69 in the year ago quarter, primarily as a result of lower non-cash acquisition-related charges.", "On the top line, organic revenue growth was 6% this quarter and our reported revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Q2 reported revenue included a 1% decline from divestitures net of acquisitions and a 6% headwind from foreign exchange. Backlog remained steady in the quarter with bookings slightly ahead of revenue.", "Looking at our growth by geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits with China growing in the mid-teens and Rest of World grew in the low single digits.", "We don't normally provide color on Japan, but given our commentary last quarter, I wanted to provide you with a brief update on developments there. As we noted on last quarter's call, the budget was approved in early April. As Q2 progressed, we started to see funding begin to flow and Japan returned to low single-digit growth for the quarter.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q2 adjusted operating income increased 3% and adjusted operating margin was 22.3%, up 90 basis points from Q2 last year, despite a 100 basis point headwind from FX.", "At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers: global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System as well as continued contribution from cost synergies. Net acquisitions and divestitures were about 15 basis points dilutive in the quarter, driven by the Cole-Parmer divestiture and ASI acquisition.", "In terms of synergies, we realized $32 million of incremental cost synergies in Q2, and for the full year we now expect cost synergies of $130 million, up $5 million from our previous guidance as a result of continuing to accelerate head count and sourcing synergies.", "Revenue synergies during the quarter were $20 million, putting us well on track to meet or exceed our full year 2015 guidance of $60 million in revenue synergies with $20 million of adjusted operating income pull-through. In Q2 we continued to make additional strategic investments, primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities and accelerate growth.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.0% in Q2, down 100 basis points from the prior year. The decrease was driven primarily by foreign exchange, unfavorable business mix and the ASI acquisition.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q2 was 21.7% of revenue, which is 170 basis points favorable to Q2 2014, driven primarily by volume leverage and our cost synergy and productivity actions. And finally R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, 20 basis points below Q2 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q2 was 6.4%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q2 was $95 million, down $18 million from last year as a result of reducing our debt over the last 12 months. Adjusted other income for Q2 was $4 million, which is $3 million higher than Q2 last year, driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange gains.", "Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14.0%, 30 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of acquisition tax planning. We returned $60 million of capital through dividends in the quarter and average diluted shares were $401.5 million in Q2, down $1.6 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of the share buy backs we completed in Q1 of this year, partially offset by option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow in the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first half of the year was $849 million and free cash flow was $663 million, after deducting net capital expenditures of $186 million. This is about $160 million lower than the first half of 2014, primarily driven by volume-related working capital investments and the timing of interest and tax payments.", "We ended the quarter with $770 million in cash and investments, down $100 million sequentially from Q1, as we used surplus cash on the balance sheet as well as cash generated in the quarter to reduce debt. Our total debt at the end of Q2 was $14.0 billion, down $830 million sequentially from Q1, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA.", "You may have seen that we continue to capitalize on the favorable interest rate environment, having recently completed a $500 million Eurobond offerings consisting of 2.15% seven-year senior notes. We're using the proceeds to pay down short-term debt and pre-fund the Alfa Aesar acquisition. We still expect to achieve a leverage ratio of about 3 times by the end of 2015.", "To wrap up my comments on the total company, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q2 was 9.1%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q1. So with that, I'll now walk you through the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, FX was a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and negatively impacted their year-over-year revenue growth to varying degrees.", "Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q2 and organic revenue grew 7%. In the quarter we continued to see outstanding growth in our BioProduction business, in addition to very strong growth in BioSciences. Q2 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 8% and adjusted operating margin was 28.6%, up 150 basis points. In the segment, margin benefited from very strong productivity and incremental costs synergies, along with meaningful volume leverage. This was partially offset by significantly unfavorable FX and the ASI acquisition.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 2% in Q2, and organic revenue growth was 4%. In the quarter we had strong growth in our chromatography and service businesses, which was partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q2 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 7% and adjusted operating margin was 18.0%, up 160 basis points. In the segment we delivered very strong productivity and good volume leverage, which was partially offset by unfavorable FX and strategic growth investments.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q2 total revenue decreased 4%. Organic growth was 2%, driven by our Clinical Diagnostics and ImmunoDiagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 4% in Q2 and adjusted operating margin was 27.8%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we had strong productivity and solid volume leverage, partially offset by strategic growth investments and unfavorable FX.", "And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q2 reported revenue was flat to prior year and organic growth was 8%. This segment benefited from our strong performance this quarter in the biopharma end market, with our biopharma services business delivering very strong growth along with good growth across the rest of the businesses in the segment.", "Adjusted operating income in Laboratory Products and Services increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 15.4%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by strong productivity, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and the Cole-Parmer divestiture.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full-year 2015 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're increasing both our top and bottom line guidance as a result of current foreign exchange rates and strong operating performance. On the top line, we're raising both the low and high end of our guidance range and increasing the midpoint by $40 million. This leads to a new full year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.72 billion to $16.86 billion.", "The increase in our revenue guidance midpoint is due entirely to the change in FX rates, so we're still expecting organic revenue growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance. We still expect acquisitions net of divestitures will contribute about 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015, which excludes any impact from the pending acquisition of Alfa Aesar.", "Moving to our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.03 and the high end by $0.01 to a new range of $7.28 to $7.41. This range represents year-over-year growth of 5% to 6%, which compares to our previous guidance of 4% to 6% growth. To bridge the $0.02 increase in the midpoint of our full year 2015 adjusted EPS guidance, we're driving about $0.05 of improvement from operating performance in the accelerated cost synergies, which is being partially offset by about $0.03 of unfavorable pull-through on the change in FX rates.", "So to summarize the impact of FX on our current guidance, it's now a $0.70, or 10% year-over-year headwind to our adjusted EPS. So if you were to look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 15% to 16%, representing very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, FX is now lowering our revenue by about $950 million or 6%, so our reported revenue growth guidance would be 5% on an FX neutral basis. And in terms of adjusted operating margin pull-through on the FX revenue headwind, we now expect a total impact of $330 million representing an average pull-through of 35% and 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution.", "The net result compared to our previous guidance is a positive change in revenue of about $35 million and a $15 million reduction in adjusted operating income. The negative pull-through on the increased revenue is a result of the mix of foreign currency exchange rate changes which have varying rates of pull-through along with about $10 million of incremental unfavorable transactional FX.", "Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. And, as I mentioned previously, our guidance does not include the recently announced Alfa Aesar acquisition or any other future acquisitions or divestitures.", "Turning to our adjusted operating margin guidance. We now expect 70 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year, which is 10 basis points higher at the low end than our previous guidance. On an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be a very strong 150 basis points to 160 basis points.", "Moving below the line, we're still expecting net interest expense to be in the range of $375 million to $385 million. We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year will return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks, which we completed in January.", "Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $402 million to $403 million, about the same as 2014, and consistent with our previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $435 million to $450 million, unchanged from our previous guidance.", "And, finally, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion of free cash flow for full year 2015, consistent with previous guidance. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets, as well as FX fluctuations during the year.", "In summary, we delivered a very strong top line growth and bottom line results in Q2, which positions us well at the halfway point in the year to achieve our 2015 financial goals.", "With that, I'll turn it back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Pete. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question is from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks, guys. And congrats, Pete, on the shortest retirement I've ever seen.", "Maybe just on some of the sequential improvement we saw here, particular on pharma, mid-teens growth was terrific. Can you maybe just help us think about how much of that is a function of the market conditions versus the life synergies versus I guess your value proposition as you described it? Obviously the growth there is driving a lot of the performance.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Tycho, in terms of the pharma biotech end markets, clearly the underlying conditions are strong, but obviously, nothing near the mid-teens type growth. So it's been a good market. As you know, biotech funding has been robust. Pharmaceutical companies are spending more money. But the majority of the very strong performance is driven by how our value proposition is resonating with our customers, and particularly how the underlying performance of our BioProduction BioSciences business is performing with that customer set.", "Our teams have worked very hard in putting together the two companies' capabilities, and in each of those businesses we're gaining market share and we're also seeing the benefits from our revenue synergies starting to pick up. Obviously, the revenue synergy is not a huge contributor, but it is a nice contributor to the growth in the customer side.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And I guess, speaking about the revenue walk through the back half of the year and guidance, I mean maybe the one thing I think that maybe stands out relative to your prior comments is on China because you're coming off two strong quarters here. Maybe just give us a sense of your thoughts on China in the back half the year?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so the team executed very well in the quarter and executed very well in the first half of the year. Our view is that there are still some overhang in the Chinese market as they work through the anti-corruption efforts, and obviously a little bit slower GDP growth. But, clearly, the conditions in China are better than what we assumed at the beginning of the year and has been a nice contributor to our growth. In terms of the outlook for the second half specifically, hard to forecast exactly, but it should be better than our original assumptions.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then, just last one. Was there a catch-up on China \u2013 I mean Japan? Pete, I know you talked about low single-digit growth. I'm just trying to think about the dynamics following the soft first quarter. How do we think about kind of the catch-up?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, we really didn't see a catch-up. I mean, actually, the funding is still \u2013 it's flowing but it's still a little bit slow. So I would say it's kind of back to it. It was a normal quarter without any offset from the weakness in Q1.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, and congrats. So I guess it's sort of odd \u2013 two years in a row we've had this dynamic where strong fourth quarter, weaker first quarter, recovery second quarter. I mean, I know you had given us last quarter some commentary that you had been sort of trying to understand the timing dynamic. And obviously we had a bit of a backlog build. Last quarter you had very good orders, so that sort of explains some of the sequential improvement. But as you think about the pacing and predictability in the business, anything new to share in terms of the magnitude of those sort of inflections on a quarterly basis? I mean, we always think of your business as so predictable.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, Ross, the business is quite predictable. If you think about it, we were not concerned after Q1 in our ability to do the 4% organic growth of the full year. And we're not doing victory laps after a strong Q2. We're right where we expected to be at the halfway point of the year. There were a lot of nuances to the calendar. You had less days in Q1 versus the prior year, you had clearly some customers flush some money at the end of the last year that bought some products that they knew they would use and that led to a little bit of a softer start. But we saw that the improvements happening as that first quarter went on and the team delivered a great Q2. And we sit at about 4% organic growth at the halfway point, which is where we want it to be, and we feel confident in our ability to deliver 4% growth for the full year.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Maybe turning to sort of obligatory section on M&A. You guys have been more active on the tuck-in side. It's actually kind of contradictory to what we're seeing in the market. I was listening to our company's call before and there's been a lot of large transactions versus small, which is not unusual, given where we are in the cycle. I mean, I guess is your thinking about the pipeline and the components of value you're seeing in different sub-segments, how would you sort of characterize for life sciences and diagnostics and the various areas you touch activity levels and more so on the mid-size because it seems like that's where you've been more active. How the sourcing and sort of pacing of deals is trending.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Ross, in terms of the industry, it's a $100 billion industry. We're the market leader, but we obviously have less than 20% share in aggregate. So still very fragmented, even when you take the largest few players, it's still a very fragmented industry. We have a good pipeline of bolt-on transactions. We've done two that we feel good about it and we evaluate others. And we always have an interesting pipeline on that front. The way I think about it, is we follow our criteria. Is it going to strengthen the company strategically, is it going to be well received and help the customers and clearly is it going to create shareholder value as measured by the rates of returns on those investments. And we were able to do two transactions and we'll continue to look at that pipeline over time and I think we're in a good position from the ability to deploy capital to create shareholder value.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. And lastly, so I guess, Pete, congrats on staying. Is it possible we'll get you to do cameos down the road and maybe pop in on earnings call? I was just coming to grips with you leaving and so now that you're back, I'm excited about maybe you participating a little bit more. So, is it too big of a request to ask you to come back maybe once a year and pop in?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So the only cameo you might see, Pete, is certainly not in the finance or the earnings calls, but maybe you'll see him occasionally with a tennis racquet or golf after hours. But you'll have to reach out that way.", "One of the things is that for clarity, I think it was after the period where Pete reflected on the transition to CFO and was able to take a deep breath and feel totally confident in Stephen that he and I started to talk about the next chapter of his life. I think he can add enormous value by not spending time on the finance function but rather helping us build our capabilities and strengthen the company in some other areas. So no more cameos for Pete here, but you can always reach him on non-financial related topics.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, Ross, I'm very happy to be doing my last earnings call.", "Ross Jordan Muken - Evercore ISI", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good afternoon or good morning. Hey, Marc, can I just clarify your China comments? You talked about feeling a little bit better about the second half. Is that optimism driven by your backlog and the orders you have in hand? And so this leads to the question of how much visibility you have so is this certain China macro instability something we need to worry about in 2016?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, it's a good question. In terms of visibility in China, it's less than what it used to be, say a couple of years ago, but it's not perfect. My comment really is saying we were expecting the company average for the year, when we gave the original guidance, and we've been growing. We grew high single digits in Q1, mid-teens in Q2 and we're likely to grow certainly better than the low single digit type growth, mid single digit growth for the full year. So that's really the reflection on the comment. Visibility, I think it's going to take some time before you get back to very clear visibility in China because they're still working through a lot of changes in the government.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And I guess I have to ask the obligatory NIH question and is that \u2013 how are you thinking about what's going on there? And I believe when we had you on the road recently you were still thinking that maybe the budgets could give you somewhere between 25 bps and 50 bps of incremental organic revenue growth if they go through with things. Is that still sort of your thinking on it?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, the way I think about it, I don't expect the budgeting process and things like the 21st Century Cures to have any impact in this calendar year, but could set us up for a very attractive growth environment for the NIH and US academic and government going forward, should those things become law. So those are really good, important pieces of legislation, and if we can get those enacted, that clearly is going to be a big improvement in the NIH funding. I think it's almost $9 billion of funding over the upcoming year's period. So it could be super exciting if it goes through the process.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "You next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. I'll offer my congratulations to you, Pete, and good luck with the new role in the future. And we look forward to seeing you on the tennis court, as Marc said.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "So, Marc, I want to follow-up on kind of your comments. You mentioned and I was kind of just \u2013 this morning doing the same thing, 2% first quarter, 6% this quarter, so first half you're sitting right at 4%, which is what you expect for the year. If you look at this quarter, I think what will really stand out to people is obviously that biopharma, and in particular, I think that Life Sciences Solutions growth of 7%. Many people thought that business might actually grow below the organic rate of the company.", "So can you maybe dive in a little bit and give a more specific example? I think you mentioned that the third action point of kind of growth in BioSciences and BioProduction really helped out biopharma and I'm assuming that's somewhat tied to what's happening in Life Science Solutions. So can you maybe provide a little bit more detail or specific details about the actions that you took?", "And then secondly about, kind of for the second half of the year, do you expect biopharma to keep growing at this mid-teens rate or high single digit rate, let's call it, and the rest of the businesses to stay low single digit? Or is there something you see that makes you think that maybe diagnostic and healthcare, industrial or something there could get a little bit better in the second half? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, good questions in a bunch, too. Let me start with the broader end markets and then I'll hit the specifics within the Life Science Solutions and what's going on there. If I think about the second half, we wouldn't expect pharma and biotech to be at that same torrid pace of Q2, but certainly will be a strong end market for us in the second half of the year. And our expectation is that fairly similar conditions in the academic government and diagnostics and healthcare and industrial and applied in the second half than it was in the first half. Probably slight improvements from where they are, but not particularly material and when you kind of walk through the math, that sort of gets you to the 4% growth.", "Within the Life Science Solutions segment, the team has done a great job in leveraging the combined capabilities of the company. And that is, obviously there was a lot of redundant cost and there has been an interesting \u2013 driving of great earnings growth, but also reinvestment in certain parts of the business, as well. While we have been raising synergy targets, we've also been able to strengthen the fundamentals of the business.", "You're seeing nice impact innovation in the BioSciences business. That is clearly helping accelerate the growth there. And commercially, both BioProduction and BioSciences is really leveraging the strength of the excellent commercial footprint that Thermo Fisher Scientific has in serving that customer set; leveraging our channel but also leveraging the corporate accounts and the strong relationships and the combination of good innovation and good commercial execution has put that business on a nice growth path and that's helped us, both in the biopharma customer set, but also helped us strengthen our Life Science Solutions business.", "When you go back to our Analyst Meeting in May, we expressed our confidence in changing the long-term outlook from 3% to 4% organic growth for that business, and we feel good about that. And I think a quarter like this shows you some of the early progress that we're making in strengthening the growth outlook for the business.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "That's helpful. And then if I could just quickly, as you look at your end markets again, I mean, if you go back to the lives (44:14) again, one could kind of argue that you looked out and said maybe people are too down on government and academic in the long run and it's not such a bad market. Are there any markets you're seeing like that right now that maybe people are too euphoric in one area but maybe discounting another that you think are good markets?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "When you think about the business that we have, we serve four end markets. They're slightly off-cycle from one another, which actually allows us to deliver very consistent growth. Because it's unlikely that all four are going to be in a trough, and it's unlikely that all four are going to be at a robust period. So you get this nice effect of getting steady, organic growth over long periods of time.", "In terms of the longer-term outlook, we've had, obviously, choppy academic and government end markets for a while, and things like the 21st Century Cures which pulls through, things like a recovery longer-term in China from \u2013 can be things of help that end market. Will that be a robustly growing market? No. But could it be better than where it is today? Sure. Over time I think that's probably the one that you'd see opportunities.", "Within Thermo Fisher, we're very bullish on the long-term prospects for our healthcare and diagnostics business and see that over time being one of our faster growing markets, particularly because we're driving the penetration of Life Science Tools into that market. So things like mass spectrometry, NextGen sequencing will be longer-term growth drivers for that end market, and we think that we're well positioned to get very good growth there over time.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, Marc. Helpful.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Marc, I guess, sticking with the theme, if we look at the LPS business and the volatility in that segment's core revenue growth, I mean, there are one or two things that you attribute to the volatility we've seen more recently in the growth rates, which is above what this business used to \u2013 how it used to perform, and, I mean, given the high mix of consumables in the channel business, would expect, I guess, a little more consistency. Does that normalize at some point in your view?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think that the Laboratory Products and Services business performed really well, and if you look back over the last few years, I mean, it really has been one of the nice growth drivers for the company. In the quarter, all three of the businesses that make up the segment, our Lab Products, our Customer Channels, and our BioPharma Services business, had a really good quarter, and so I feel good about it.", "In terms of why softer Q1 and then a stronger Q2 really reflects what's going on at the company level, it's not particularly segment thing. You get the same days of calendar effects in that business as you would elsewhere in the same days of the budget flush in Q4 starting out with a weaker start. So, it's a good grower for the company and one that is the heart of our customer value proposition. So, I think it's a nice growth driver going forward, as it has been historically.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "And then one more for Pete. Would be curious if you could break out the effect of currency and mix, just the components in the gross margin in the second quarter.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. So the year-over-year bridge between 49% last year and 48% this year in gross margin, we had about 75 basis points of headwind as a result of FX and about 80 basis points of unfavorable mix, that's both segment and within segment mix. And then obviously very good productivity, over 100 basis points.", "S. Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Super. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, everyone.", "The progress in China is nice to see. It's very much in line with \u2013 maybe a little bit ahead of what you had anticipated, but I take your comments to mean that you don't anticipate \u2013 and this is, of course, pretty normal for Thermo \u2013 anything along the lines of let's say a budget flush in China in the latter stages of the year. As we talk to industrials companies and tools companies, it seems like opinions on the likelihood of some sort of budget flush are really all over the map. It'd be interesting to hear your thoughts on that. Why is it you think there are divergent opinions and what are you watching to get a sense for whether any acceleration in China is a function of that in the latter stages of the year is reasonably possible?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, in terms of the \u2013 whether you would have outsize growth at the end of the year, it really is hard to forecast that. And if I think back in my 15 years with the company, it's really something that we don't actually spend a ton of time on in terms of what's going to happen in December in that particular market.", "Generally the macro trends are pretty favorable in China because GDP growth there is faster there than anywhere else in the world roughly, and the needs for our products; environmental protection, food safety, healthcare expansion are right there in the sweet spot. So, we always think that long term that we're well positioned to have outsize growth in China and get a little less focused on what's going to happen quarter to quarter. I will be there again next month and look forward to working with the team and visiting a bunch of customers, and maybe in the Q3 call I'll have a little more color on how we see the very end of the year playing out.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then incremental to your comments around the $1.4 billion of capital deployment this year, it's always helpful just to hear how you're thinking about the gating factors for any incremental share repurchase. Are we waiting to see what comes through from the M&A funnel? Are there other gates we ought to consider? And, again, I will thank you guys for all the help this morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, right now with the $1.4 billion that we have deployed and expect to deploy, that would put us at the three times leverage ratio approximately at the end of the year, which really sets us up for a great position going into 2016. We do evaluate share buybacks from time to time, and we do have an authorization. But at least at this point we're not expecting anything in the super short term. And then we plan to get back to a more normal capital deployment as we get into 2016. But we're always flexible depending on what's going on in the end markets and what's going on with the stock price at a particular point in time.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning, guys. How would you describe the pricing environment? Really what I'm getting at is how does it compare to recent periods and given that the value proposition is clearly working more and more? Is the outlook improving for pricing in the coming quarters?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So, in terms of the pricing environment, actually Q2 was a strong pricing environment for us. One of the things that we mentioned at the beginning of the year with the foreign exchange headwinds where we were going to take some incremental actions on pricing and we saw some of the benefits of that. So at the halfway point of the year, Doug, we're a little bit above 50 basis points on price, which is good. It's a little better than what we've been experiencing over the last couple years. So, that's going in the right direction and generally a pretty stable price environment.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, And a clarifying question on guidance or I guess just that's framed by guidance. As you noted and provided a lot of detail, so thanks for that, Pete. You increased revenue growth guidance largely due to FX, but you actually indicated that FX is an incremental drag on EPS. Is any of that reflective of changes in what you're expecting by geography? Essentially have your growth assumptions by geography that are imbedded into overall guidance, have they changed?", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No. It's really being driven by just the respective changes in foreign currency exchange rates. So, for instance, compared to our previous guidance, the yen, which pulls through at about 60% is up 2.5% \u2013 or declined by about 2.5%, while the pound, which is pull through less than 5% actually went up by 3.5%. You can see just those two currencies, which are two of our significant currencies, you end up with positive revenue and negative pull-through. So it's just the relative changes in the currencies.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And one last one. You guys had a really strong Analytical Instruments margin performance in the quarter. I think you were up 130 basis points sequentially, 160 basis points year-over-year. I think it's fair to say that was better than many expected in a quarter where I think the organic growth was solid but about as expected and FX remained a tough headwind. Is there any additional dynamic to kind of walk through here just to kind of explain that solid performance and the sustainability moving forward? Thank you.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, in terms of year-over-year improvement 150 basis points, really solid improvement there. We had great productivity. Probably 50 basis points or so above what our normal run rate would be. We had really good pull-through on the incremental revenue. And that, obviously, was a little bit offset by foreign exchange, which was a pretty significant headwind. I would say this is an outsized level of expansion. So I wouldn't expect that every quarter going forward. But really good performance this quarter.", "Doug A. Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, again.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, good morning, guys. Thank you. A question first on diagnostics. I used to think of that business as being maybe a mid to high single-digit growth area. And last year, I appreciated a little bit of a tougher comp in 2Q versus 1Q. But just wondering kind of how you're looking at the growth rate there and wondering if it was \u2013 whether it was transplant diagnostics or maybe another area? If there was something that's been sort of weighing on the growth rate that could either abate or turn for the better.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so Isaac, good morning. In terms of the diagnostics and healthcare, no \u2013 really if I think about the first half of low single-digit growth, first quarter you had the calendar. And in the first half a little bit weaker seasonal on both flu and allergy relative to the prior year. So those are really the factors there. The way I think about is I agree with you. I think on the mid-term and beyond is actually one of our faster growing businesses. Transplant did fine, so no issues there. So I think it's more just as you see some of the new products get launched in future periods, you'll see that growth pick up over time.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just another question on bioprocess. I think you touched a little bit qualitatively on how that's going. But wondering if put some rough numbers? It seems like that market was off to a hard start for everyone in the first quarter, and I'm assuming that was the case. But just wondering if you can put some numbers around bioprocess this quarter as well as your expectations for the balance of the year? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. It's a strong business for us. It was a meaningful contributor to our growth within the Life Science Solutions segment, and certainly of a meaningful scale business, our fastest growing business. So really a good performer. On the specific numbers it's well above the company average.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks a bunch.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning. Marc, could you provide some additional color on the biopharma end market? I guess specifically what I'm looking for is what do you see in large pharma, kind of spec pharm, biotech, and what are the growth rates there?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So biotech by far the fastest-growing subset. You may recall a few quarters ago I talked about and certainly we reinforced, Alan Malus reinforced at the Analyst Meeting. Our push from how we approach our customers, we had great momentum with large pharma to really expand our efforts with biotech. And that clearly is paying off, right?", "So the biotech funding environment as you know is very strong and that's translating into spending at the Life Science Tools level, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on it. But our Big Pharma customers are doing well, right? Their pipelines look better and more drugs are getting approved and we're very well-positioned because of our value propositions. So we're seeing good growth there with our larger customers as well. So biotech is strongest, but not really any particular points of weakness within that customer set.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "That's great. And a follow-up on the chromatography strength. I guess how would you position this? Is this mainly a factor of the new products and execution on your side, or are you seeing any disruption in the competitive environment that you're taking advantage of?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No disruption on the competitive front. We have good competitors in the field. In terms of \u2013 we had really good strength. Our team did a nice job. Ion Chromatography did well, the liquid chromatography did well and gas chromatography did well in the quarter. So really good strength between the instruments and consumables, so just really solid execution. New products help, but that wasn't a material driver of the very strong performance.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks a lot. thanks, guys.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "And, Operator, we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. And thanks for squeezing me in. I just wanted to ask one more or the policy side with the NIH funding. And just as you're talking with customers today, I know think you're thinking about this maybe as being more of a 2016 helper. But just if you're seeing anybody preparing ahead of the bill, and then whether you think you could actually bleed over from academic into any other customer segments?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We have a lot of dialogue with our academic and government customers, and I would say that it is \u2013 no one's spending in advance of it. I think that a lot of folks are trying to push to get these things over the goal line because it would be good for the U.S. and certainly good for their own environment.", "So you have a lot of folks rallying to get it through, but I don't think anyone is spending yet. I don't think that in the short term it will bleed into other segments, but I do think strong NIH funding actually positions biotech pharma and the diagnostics segments better, because there is clearly a spillover. So pumping more money into that from a government perspective is a huge positive for the eco system down the road. So, as you know, I'm a big believer in the NIH.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, got it. And then, just the last one on the LPS strength. I was just curious on the clinical side of the market, whether you've seen any sort of changes in the volume dynamic in the U.S. that you thought was helping there and driving some of the robust growth the past couple of years?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, nothing particular. The clinical exposure in that segment is a little bit less than the company average. So not really a big driver there. So thank you for the question.", "Peter M. Wilver - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So before Marc makes his closing comments, I just wanted to say how much I've enjoyed being CFO for the past 11 years. And I'm really going to miss interacting with our investors and sell side analysts. As you know, Stephen and I have worked together for 15 years. He knows the company as well as I do and I'm very confident that he'll do a great job as CFO and continue to work with Marc and the rest of the team to take Thermo Fisher to the next level.", "Stephen Williamson - Vice President-Financial Operations", "Thanks, Pete. I'm really excited about the new role. I hope to meet many of you during the course of the year. I look forward to updating everyone on our Q3 call in October.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So with that to wrap up we had an excellent Q2. We're in a great position to deliver another strong year and we look forward to updating you on our progress in the next quarter.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note that this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until November 6, 2015.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks Ken and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 call. I'm pleased to report that we delivered a solid quarter with good growth on the top and bottom line. Q3 is another example of how we're successfully executing our growth strategy and increasing our depth of capabilities to gain market share.", "We had another great quarter for innovation with important new product launches across our businesses. We are leveraging our scale in APAC and emerging markets as a key differentiator and we had another strong quarter in China. We also continued to make good progress in capturing revenue synergies using our expanded technology portfolio, our commercial capabilities and global reach to show our customers the power of our value proposition. With a strong nine months behind us, we're on track to achieve our growth goals for the year.", "Before I get into the business highlights for the quarter, let me start with the financial overview and some color commentary on our end markets. Then I will conclude with our updated guidance outlook for the year.", "So in terms of the financials, our revenue in Q3 was $4.12 billion. Our adjusted operating income increased 2% to $934 million. We achieved adjusted operating margin of 22.6% which represents 70 basis points of margin expansion. And finally we extended our track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We achieved $1.80 of adjusted EPS which is a 5% increase over Q3 of last year.", "We drove good pull through on our top line growth, using our PPI Business System to increase our operating efficiencies and provide the highest quality products and services to our customers. Our solid results again this quarter demonstrate our ability to effectively manage the business, despite the FX headwinds and achieve our growth goals.", "So starting with our performance by end market, we didn't see much change in Q3. In industrial and applied our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with low single digit growth. Our core industrial businesses remained soft, while those serving applied markets again performed well. We had good growth in our analytical instrument businesses serving environmental and food safety markets. We also had another strong quarter in our chromatography business.", "Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, our performance in this end market was pretty similar to what we've seen in first half of the year with growth in the low single digits. The key contributors in Q3 were our clinical diagnostics business and our healthcare market channel, which continued to grow well.", "In academic and government, we grew again this quarter in the low single digits. Conditions in this end market were basically similar to what we experienced in Q2. Last, I'm pleased to say that we had another excellent quarter in pharma and biotech which grew for us at just over 10%. We continue to capitalize on the strength of this end market overall and effectively leverage our unique value proposition, which really resonates with these customers. We had strong performance across our businesses that serve this end market and particularly in biosciences, bioproduction, and biopharma services.", "Let me now highlight some of our accomplishments from Q3 in the context of our growth strategy. We continue to make great progress on all fronts which positions us for another successful year. As you know, our growth strategy is centered around high impact technology innovation, leveraging our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets and delivering our unique value proposition to best serve our customers and gain share.", "In terms of innovation, Thermo Fisher has by far the largest R&D budget in our industry at approximately $700 million annually and we continue to target those investments that create the most value for our customers.", "Let me hit some of the highlights from Q3. First, in September we introduced the new Ion S5 and Ion S5 XL, next-generation sequencing systems. This is a significant development that builds on our Ion Torrent platform. It makes targeted sequencing more accessible to customers working in academic, translational and clinical research labs. The key advantages of both systems are that they're cost effective and flexible, giving scientists the ability to sequence gene panels as well as small genomes, exomes and transcriptomes on a single platform.", "We're also making great progress in developing new products that improve the speed and accuracy of test results in the clinical laboratory. At the Annual Meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, we launched a number of new Thermo Scientific instruments and assays designed to help clinicians improve patient diagnosis and treatment.", "Let me mention a couple of them. We launched three new immunoassays that have been FDA cleared for detecting autoimmune diseases. These new EliA assays can help diagnose multiple conditions that could be precursors to kidney disease. We also introduced the Phadia 2500E instrument which is now configured to run both our EliA autoimmunity and ImmunoCAP allergy tests to significantly increase lab productivity.", "In our analytical instruments business, we introduced a new HPLC system, a Thermo Scientific Prelude LX-4 MD which is listed with the FDA as a class I medical device for general in vitro diagnostics use. The Prelude LX-4 significantly enhances sample throughput for high volume clinical settings.", "Also worthy to note, during the quarter we obtained CE marks for our Prelude MD HPLC, Endura MD mass spec and related ClinQuan MD software, which were all previously introduced in the U.S. This designation gives clinical labs in Europe access to advanced technologies for analyzing patient samples using laboratory developed tests.", "Let me take a moment now to highlight an example that demonstrates how our customers are recognizing the value we can create through our unique depth of capabilities and our reputation as a scientific thought leader. We've been collaborating with the Biotech Research and Innovation Center at the University of Copenhagen to help researchers better understand how gene mutations can lead to cancer progression. Scientists there recently published two landmark studies in the scientific journal, Cell. Their work was based on results generated by our Orbitrap Fusion mass spec and our Ion Torrent next-gen sequencing technologies.", "These studies offer insight into human cell biology that may eventually lead to more effective cancer treatments and better outcomes for patients. This is a great example of the new capabilities we're now able to deliver to our customers, based on our successful integration of Life Technologies.", "Just to give you a quick update on where we are relative to our revenue synergy target, we continue to make great progress in Q3 building on the momentum we've had all year. With nine months behind us, we're at $50 million, which positions us to slightly exceed our revenue goal for the year.", "Turning to APAC and emerging markets, China seems to be on the top of everyone's mind, and I've been getting a lot of questions about it. I'm pleased to report that we had another strong quarter in China which contributed to good growth for us in APAC overall. Our China strategy is clearly working and we delivered 15% growth in Q3. We continue to work with the government and our customers to meet their goals for improving healthcare, the environment, and food safety.", "Back in August, I had the opportunity to visit some of these customers with our team in China, and their feedback reinforces why our technologies are well positioned there. Here are a couple of observations from my trip. It's great to see our high-end instruments in customer labs there. Our Q Exactive HF and Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass specs are being used for proteomics research and our next-generation sequencing technologies are helping to advance oncology research.", "We also supplied our gas and particulate monitors to ensure that air quality was safe after the widely publicized chemical warehouse explosion in Tianjin. I think this is an example that illustrates why the diversity of our technology portfolio is a key advantage in addressing China's needs.", "The investments we've made in our China Innovation Center are also bearing fruit and we have a number of our products soon to be launched that have been designed specifically to meet the needs of the local market. So we have great momentum with our customers, our team is executing well and we continue to feel good about our prospects for growth in China.", "In other emerging markets, we continued our strategy of expanding our presence to position us for growth. And the most recent example is an investment that we made in Brazil. We opened a new Customer Experience Center in S\u00e3o Paulo to serve markets across Latin America. This center is a showcase for our analytical capabilities and allows us to partner with customers to help them achieve their goals by developing new methods using our technologies.", "We made this investment in Brazil despite the current economic challenges that this country is facing in the short term because we believe it will position us for market share gains as the customer and funding environment improves.", "Before I move on to our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. Just after quarter end, we completed our acquisition of Alfa Aesar for approximately $400 million, to expand our offering of laboratory chemicals. This is a nice complementary bolt-on that gives our customers access to a much broader portfolio, whether working in research or production. It's another great example of how we strengthen our strategic position by leveraging our scale and customer reach.", "In terms of capital deployment, we bought back $500 million of stock in January. We deployed $700 million to make two strategic bolt-on acquisitions and we continue to return capital to our shareholders through our quarterly dividend. So, we've deployed a total of $1.4 billion for the year-to-date in order to create value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Now, let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2015. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $16.81 billion to $16.91 billion. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $7.33 to $7.41. This equates to 5% to 6% growth over our strong results in 2014.", "So in summary, it was a great quarter. We delivered solid financial performance. We made excellent progress in executing our growth strategy and we continue to make wise investments to create shareholder value.", "With that, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'm going to begin with an overview of our total company financial performance, then provide some color on our four segments and conclude with our updated 2015 guidance.", "So starting with our overall financial performance for the third quarter, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 5% to $1.80. GAAP EPS in Q3 was $1.18, up 1%.", "On the top line, we achieved organic revenue growth of 4% this quarter, and our reported revenue was down 1% year-over-year. Q3 reported revenues included a 6% headwind from foreign exchange and a neutral impact from acquisitions net of divestitures. And please note that the components of the Q3 change in revenue do not sum due to rounding. And bookings were slightly less than revenue in the quarter but grew organically in all four segments.", "Looking at our growth by geography, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single-digits. Asia Pacific grew in the high-single-digits, with China growing in the mid-teens, and rest of the world declined in the mid-single-digits.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, up 70 basis points from Q3 last year, despite 110 basis points of headwind from foreign exchange.", "At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion for the quarter was driven by continued strong contribution from our primary productivity levers, global sourcing, footprint optimization and our PPI Business System, as well as continued contribution from cost synergies. To add some color on our synergies, we realized $32 million of incremental cost synergies in Q3, in line with our full year target of $130 million. And revenue synergies during the quarter were $25 million. And, as Marc mentioned, this puts us in a great position to slightly exceed our full year, 2015 target of $60 million of revenue synergies. We've been able to accelerate our actions and are on track to deliver the $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016.", "In Q3, we continued to make additional strategic growth investments and primarily to strengthen our core technology platforms and commercial capabilities.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.3% in Q3, down 80 basis points from the previous year. The decrease was driven primarily by foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix. Adjusted SG&A in Q3 was 21.5% of revenue, which is 140 basis points favorable to Q3 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies and our productivity actions. And, finally, R&D expense came in at 4.2% of revenue, flat to Q3 last year, and R&D, as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q3, was 6.5%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q3 was $93 million, down $13 million from Q3 last year as a result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Adjusted other income for Q3 was $2 million, which is flat to Q3 last year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, 80 basis points below last year, primarily as a result of realizing the benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402 million in Q3, down 1.7 million year-over-year, primarily as a result of share buybacks we completed in Q1 and partially offset by option dilution.", "So turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q3 was $1.6 billion. And free cash flow was $1.31 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $286 million. We ended the quarter with $505 million in cash and investments, down $265 million, sequentially from Q2 as we used surplus cash on the balance sheet, as well as cash generated in the quarter, to reduce debt.", "We returned $60 million of capital through dividends in the quarter and just after the quarter end, we spent approximately $400 million on the acquisition of Alfa Aesar. Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $13.3 billion, down $700 million sequentially from Q2, and our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.2 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. We still expect to achieve a leverage ratio of about three times by the end of 2015.", "And wrapping up my comments on the total company performance, we continued to make progress on our ROIC, a trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q3 was 9.3%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q2.", "So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind to the top line for our segments and impacted the year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees.", "Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 1% in Q3, and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and bioscience businesses. Q3 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 30.8%, up 220 basis points.", "In the segment, adjusted operating margin benefited from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, along with some favorable product mix, partially offset by significantly unfavorable foreign exchange.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue decreased 1% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 5%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and service businesses, which was partially offset by the continued weakness we've seen in some of our core industrial markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 6% and adjusted operating margin was 18.8%, up 130 basis points. In the segment, we delivered very strong productivity and we experienced favorable product mix, which was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3, total revenue decreased 4% and organic growth was 1%. This was driven by good growth in our clinical diagnostics and healthcare market channel businesses, partially offset by the expiration of an OEM contract within this segment. Adjusted operating income in this segment decreased 9% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 26.4%, down 120 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, unfavorable foreign exchange, product mix, and strategic growth investments were partially offset by productivity initiatives.", "Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 1% and organic growth was 7%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end markets, with our biopharma services business delivering very strong growth, along with good growth across the rest of our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 1% and adjusted operating margin was 15.2%, up 10 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements, partially offset by strategic growth investments.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our full year 2015 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're increasing both the top and bottom line guidance, primarily as a result of somewhat better foreign exchange rates and the acquisition of Alfa Aesar which, as I mentioned, closed shortly after the quarter end.", "From a revenue standpoint, we're raising both the low and the high end of our guidance range, and increasing the midpoint by $70 million. This leads to a new full year 2015 revenue guidance range of $16.81 billion to $16.91 billion. Of the $70 million increase in the midpoint, approximately $40 million is due to the slightly improved foreign exchange environment and $30 million relates to the addition of Alfa Aesar. So we're still expecting organic revenue growth of about 4% for the full year 2015, consistent with our previous guidance. Acquisitions net of divestitures now contribute a little over 1% to our reported revenue growth in 2015.", "Moving to our adjusted EPS guidance, we're raising the low end by $0.05 to a new range of $7.33 to $7.41. This range represents a year-over-year growth 5% to 6%. The midpoint of the new range is $7.37, a $0.025 increase from our previous guidance. And to bridge the $0.025 we're driving about $0.01 of improvement from the acquisition of Alfa Aesar, $0.01 from improved foreign exchange, and about $0.005 from below the line items. Our current adjusted EPS guidance has a $0.69 or 10% negative impact from foreign exchange.", "If you look at our guidance on an FX neutral basis, adjusted EPS would be growing 15% to 16%, representing very strong underlying operating performance. On the top line, foreign exchange is now lowering our revenue by just over $900 million, or about 5%, so our reported revenue growth guidance would be 5% on an FX neutral basis.", "And in terms of adjusted operating margin pull through on the FX revenue headwind, we now expect a total impact of about $325 million, representing an average pull through of 36%, and 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. The change in foreign exchange compared to our previous guidance is an increase in revenue of about $40 million, with a pull through of approximately 15%.", "Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates. And as I mentioned previously, the guidance now includes the acquisition of Alfa Aesar, but does not include any other future acquisitions over divestitures.", "Turning to our adjusted operating margin guidance, we expect 70 basis points to 80 basis points of expansion year-over-year, which is unchanged from our previous guidance. On an FX neutral basis, our margin expansion would be a very strong 150 basis points to 160 basis points, also unchanged from previous guidance.", "Moving below the line, we're expecting net interest expense to be about $385 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance and we're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance.", "In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming that this year we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends as well as $500 million through share buybacks which we completed in January. Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be $402 million, slightly lower than our previous guidance, and we're expecting net capital expenditures to be in the range of $395 million to $410 million, down $40 million from our previous guidance. And finally, we're still expecting about $2.6 billion of free cash flow for full year 2015, consistent with our previous guidance.", "As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as our most likely view of how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year.", "So in summary, we delivered another solid quarter in Q3, which positions us well to achieve our 2015 financial goals. With that, I will turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. First, I'm wondering actually if you can call out Japan. I didn't hear that in the prepared comments. Obviously that's been a source of weakness for some of the other companies in this space. I know it was a little bit soft last quarter, so can you maybe just touch on dynamics there?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, Tycho. Good morning. Asia Pacific was strong for us in the quarter. We had great strength in China. Japan grew but in a muted fashion, not materially different than we would have expected. There's clearly some government budgeting challenges, which means that the next quarter may be a little muted, but given the strength we have in China, it shouldn't be a significant factor for Thermo Fisher.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then a question on visibility in some of the core end markets. I mean, if we look at kind of what's going on in the industrial world, obviously the data points have not exactly been encouraging from some of the companies that have reported thus far; in particular, with oil and gas exposure. Can you maybe talk on your visibility into the industrial channel over the next couple of quarters? And then similarly with pharma, you've obviously had great strength there over the past year, maybe just talk about the sustainability of those trends and obviously, with the biotech funding window shutting, whether maybe there is some sensitivity around that?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so in terms of those end markets, Tycho, the core industrial business that we serve has been weak now for a protracted period of time and our assumption is it's going to continue to be in that state. So we did not see a further deceleration. It's been a soft end market and we've been able to power through that in terms of our driving results. So that is what it is.", "Applied markets, however, are continuing to have good strength. Our environmental markets, food safety was strong and, as I look forward to the next couple of quarters, the applied markets also benefit from a very nuance thing, which is in the U.S. the Coal Miner Safety Act actually has a deadline in terms of when air monitoring has to be done. And that goes into effect February 1. So we had a couple of nice things going on on the environmental side that helps us on the applied and we're making the assumption that at least for the next couple of quarters, if not longer, we're going to be in a muted industrial outlook.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then biopharma?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. In terms of pharma and biotech, I could talk about pharma and biotech forever. We're well positioned there and the market is doing great. 10% growth in the market. Clearly, as we saw in the last few quarters, the market is a little better than what it has been, say, in the previous few years. That's primarily because drugs are getting through the FDA process and getting approved. So the customers are getting a return on their R&D investments and they're spending money. And we are really well positioned with this customer set. We have incredible access to the executives at all level in these organizations. They understand our technologies and how we help drive both their productivity and innovation. And you are seeing very strong momentum across our entire portfolio from bioproduction, based on a lot of what's going on on the biotech front.", "Biosciences, it's a result of the synergies, if you will, in terms of leveraging the Thermo Fisher strength with these customers and biopharma services is just a great business that continues to drive momentum. So we feel good about the position for biopharma.", "Clearly lots of headlines about pricing and it seems to be a political hot potato that obviously is something we pay attention to, but as long as drugs are getting through the pipeline and they are making progress there, we feel that this is going to continue to be a good solid end market for us.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then just lastly, with valuations getting cheaper in the market, does that change the pace of maybe some of the M&A discussions?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, in terms of the M&A, we always have this huge pipeline of activity where we're always exploring different opportunities, and then it becomes a question of when the value creation is going to work for us. So we're looking at things as we have for the last many years and we have an interesting pipeline and should the right deal line up then you'll see us do it, and if not, we'll just get back to normal capital deployment, which is coming up soon, we're only a couple of months away from 2016. Thanks, Tycho.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you talk a little bit about the OEM customer in Specialty Diagnostics and sort of what's the monetary impact of that is? I mean, what would have growth been without it?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so good question. In terms of the Diagnostics business, we had sunsetted or we had an expiration of a contract with one OEM customer at the end of 2014. The particular customer was acquired by a competitor somewhat before that, so we knew that contract was going to come to an expiration. It was about two points of organic growth headwind in the segment in the quarter. It will be about a one point of headwind in the fourth quarter and then it is gone. It was totally baked into our guidance at the beginning of the year. It's something we knew. We knew it's more of a backend impact on this particular segment and so it's one of those things that will be behind us and positions our diagnostics business well through the other actions we're taking.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just my other quick one. So you're tracking in the Life Sciences Solutions business at about 4.6% averaging organic revenue growth, so nice 5% average. Is that a sustainable, something in that 4% to 5% range going forward, given where the markets are?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So as we said back in May, we raised our outlook from 3% for this segment to 4% and every quarter that we are doing 4% or better will give us more confidence that it could be higher, but we want to deliver this for a while before we create a new norm. But the team is doing a really good job of executing in our Life Sciences Solutions business. They're leveraging the capabilities of the rest of Thermo Fisher to drive growth and improve our competitive position, so more to come on that over time.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome, Derik.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, guys. I guess I just want to get back to the emerging market discussion. So obviously some of the more industrial focused countries, Russia, Brazil, et cetera have been troubled for some time, but I guess many of us are kind of surprised by the resilience of China. I guess, Marc, you spent a ton of time over there, as you think about sort of the underlying drivers, your confidence in the duration, a little context would be helpful. And then help us understand the pacing, I realize you don't have anything out there formally for next year, but the pacing of that market as we get into 2016, just because it seems like the comps will get a little more difficult. So help us frame what that trajectory could look like?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Ross, in terms of emerging markets, for us this year, China is performing very well. India is performing very well. Obviously, Russia is really, really soft, right? So it is what it is. And if I go back and I think about my 15 years at the company, there's always puts and takes in emerging markets. There's very few periods where everything is robust. So it's kind of a portfolio, which is why you typically invest in the downturn in some of these markets, so you're positioned when the funding improves. While the investment we made in Brazil was not large by any sense, it was more of a statement that we're in these markets for the long term, we have important customers and as things improve we're capitalizing to seize on where the funding is.", "In terms of China, the team has doing a really good job. They're really executing very well and they're gaining shares as far as we can tell, through all the data we look at. What I would say is the industrial business there has been pretty muted for a while. And what's driving the growth really is the applied markets and the needs on the applied markets are very, very, very substantial, right? In terms of water issues, air pollution issues, and food safety issues, there's a huge need. And what was encouraging was to see that the food safety portion of the business is clearly picking up, which gives a encouraging view that some of those spend will be positive.", "China, in this environment, is very hard to forecast. So, we're certainly not in a position to talk about 2016 yet. What I can say is that we had good bookings in the quarter which positions us for a solid year in terms of China for 2015 and that's good. To me, it's about making the most of the opportunities and our team is doing a good job of pivoting to where the funding is in the Chinese market.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Got it. And maybe just on Specialty Diagnostics, we'll stick back there. So a lot of dislocation, at least amongst the public players, in the diagnostic universe. You play in some unique niche markets. How do you think about the evolution of your strategy there and where you sit today and how to think about some of the dislocations that have happened, whether it's from an M&A standpoint or a warning of staying away from certain markets. And then your appetite maybe to move upstream and to other parts of that complex, or maybe other things with sort of a more medical bias?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Ross, in terms of the end markets and in this sort of the market landscape, it's a very fragmented market. We pick very carefully where we play and where we don't play. Right? We want to have good, sustainable industry structure in this segment so that you can maintain really nice profitability with a reasonable rate of growth. And that's how we played it out. We've built enough scale so that when we launch new technologies we can reach those customers easily. You know we have a focus in clinical oncology. In the sequencing business, you are hearing us talking about some launches from our analytical instruments. That all leverages the scale we have in that market.", "So over time, do I think there's going to be bolt-on M&A activities in the diagnostic realm? Absolutely, it's incredibly fragmented. We've got a good track record in the acquisitions that we've done there in generating really good returns. So when we see the right opportunities, we'll pick them up. And what's important to reinforce, there's nothing we have to do here, right? We have a great portfolio with a great position. So we look at them and say where do we think we can uniquely make businesses better and create value for our shareholders", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks, Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, and congratulations, Marc, on a solid quarter and the team. I guess the main question I have for you, Marc, is if you look at book-to-bill, it's below one, it's kind of for first time in a while. I know you kind of don't \u2013 you recommend don't getting too focused on book-to-bill. So I'm just curious how you're thinking about that metric and, maybe, where you saw orders that didn't come in as quickly as revenues in the quarter?", "Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, good morning, Jon. This is Stephen. So, I'll take this question. The book to bill was just below 1. For the year-to-date, it's actually just slightly above 1. And we had good bookings growth across all four segments this quarter, so no areas of concern on the book-to-bill.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. And then I guess, Marc, if I look at again at acquisitions for the year, you've been kind of silent, and I'm curious. I guess, I have a little different take. Do you think that given the pull back in some of the public equity prices; do you think that makes M&A more or less likely? You have some sellers who maybe are still thinking about valuations where they were. And how would you expect M&A to influence your 2016?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I like the acquisitions that we've done. I like ASI. It serves the bioproduction segment, which is one of our fastest growing businesses and that integration has gone smoothly. Alfa Aesar is an incredibly complementary acquisition in terms of strengthening both our channel business and our global chemicals business. And I think we'll generate very strong returns there as well.", "In terms of the landscape, we're always looking at things, and the way that I think about it is the depressed stock prices relative to two months ago, probably doesn't reduce the price you pay for an acquisition, but it certainly would increase the odds of an acquisition happening. And I'm not saying there really is... I don't think you get a bargain because the stock is down from where it was a short while ago, but I think people say, well, God, I have to work hard to get back to it. So it becomes a little bit easier on some of those things. So I don't think it's materially different, Jon, but that's how I would handicap it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks, and good morning. I wanted to start and just ask about the Lab Products and Services segment. Now two quarters with really nice high-single digit growth. Just what are your thoughts on the sustainability of that growth in the near term? And what have been some of the areas of strength there?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "A great question. So, generally, the way we think about this is a business that generally grows in line with the company average. It has a larger exposure to biotech and pharmaceutical end market, given that the biopharma services business resides there and our channel business resides there that has strong presence. So what you're seeing right now is with a very robust performance by us in the biotech and pharma market. That shows up there disproportionately, but it also shows up in Life Sciences Solutions, it shows up in our chroma and mass spec business with Analytical Instruments. But it really gets highlighted in Lab Products and Services segments. So as long as biotech and pharma continues to do well and we continue to execute well there, we should be driving pretty good growth out of LP&S.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it, that makes sense. And then just one bigger question, I guess, related to something that was asked earlier. Just around all the change that's happening in the market today around lab reimbursement, I was curious how you thought that could impact the business for Thermo or for some of your customer segments? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, thank you. So In terms of reimbursement, there's a lot of recent press around U.S. reimbursement for certain lab tests. We've been in this environment globally for a while, right? Where you have a situation where countries are trying to keep their healthcare costs under control. And we've been able to navigate that successfully by working with our customers to help them maximize the reimbursement that they can get for their capabilities. We're making substantial investments in our health economics team, which is really what justifies why health systems around the world should be using our products. So that's part of the response.", "When I think about the most recent dialog in the US, clearly it would affect some of our customers, particularly in the drugs of abuse area. It's not a huge business for us, but given that we offer different methodologies that have different reimbursement rates, a lot of what we're doing with our customers now is helping them position the testing in a way that they can get properly reimbursed for their products. So we will work hard to navigate through any impacts from what's going on in some of the preliminary discussions on U.S. reimbursement.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Let me just start with a couple of, I guess, follow-up questions. On pharma, revenue growth has ranged between mid-single digits to mid-teens for the past seven quarters. I don't have the 2013 figure in front of me, but I think that was a pretty good year for that end market as well. So recognizing what you said in response to Tycho's earlier question, the comps are getting tougher and there are some building concerns about some recent developments in this end market. So as we think about the next few quarters ahead, are the fundamentals and, frankly, the value proposition that's unique to Thermo enough to overcome what really is, if nothing else, a mathematical challenge of continuing to drive growth in this end market that has been close to 10% for at least a couple of years?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, when I think about the performance, and I was looking back to 2013 as well, we grew high single digits in 2013 in pharma and biotech. We've been able to deliver that mid to high-single digit growth. Obviously, this year we've had a couple of quarters above that. Again, some difficult comparisons. We're going to have difficult comparisons next year, but we're really well positioned here. And when I think about our end markets in aggregate, I feel good about our outlook. There's always some puts and takes in the various markets, but we're well positioned here. When I think about the dialog we're having with our big pharmaceutical customers and the dialog we're having with our small biotech customers, there are so many of them, I remain bullish about the outlook for these end markets", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then really a follow-up on China, I don't know if you would be willing to get this specific, but could you share anything on the book-to-bill there and would you confirm that assumptions that you have embedded into full year guidance specific to China remain unchanged? And then any insight you could provide on what you think we should expect with the release of the new five year plan over the next few weeks?", "Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Doug. So the book-to-bill is a positive book-to-bill. It's over 3% above revenue. So we've had good bookings all year really for China.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So in terms of the outlook for the year, we didn't really do much in terms of guiding by China. We kind of called it \u2013 we took a pass on it saying it was just the company average because it was hard to forecast at the beginning of the year. Clearly, China is growing meaningfully above it and has offset some other things, right? So we feel good about delivering the 4% organic growth for the full year, and like every other year, you do it using a slightly different way than what you think you're going to do at the beginning of the year because it's our job to put the resources where the best opportunities are. So China has been good, the team has executed well. It's offset some softness in other markets and we feel good about the short-term positioning there.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then the five-year plan, any insight there, Marc?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The five-year plan only to the respect that at least \u2013 obviously, they don't release it early. The priorities that have been driving our growth over the last number of years around health care expansion, food safety and environmental seem to be highly likely that those will continue to be priorities. So while they haven't published it yet, we feel like these are things that have been a priority for China and are likely to continue to be a priority going forward.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much for taking the questions, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citi. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, good morning. Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Maybe just one for me on the biopharma side. Marc, you're obviously having a lot of success with the large players there. Can you just talk a little bit about how you're finding the ability to be a strategic partner with some of the smaller emerging biotech companies? And the reason I ask is I'm just trying to understand how spending might be post a funding event for these guys over time?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We're well positioned with the smaller biotech. You may recall a couple of years ago we started to expand our coverage model. We always called on those customers, but calling on them as a company level as opposed to a business level and that's worked really well. Even if the spend might be pre-IPO, it might be $1 million or $2 million with a decent-sized startup, over time, those spends really can grow with the ones that have product developments making it through the pipeline. So we're serving those customers well. We're doing a really good job of leveraging our capabilities there. So we think that in terms of biotech, as they convert their cash into products moving through the pipeline, we'll be one of the beneficiaries of that.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks for that. And then maybe if I could just move to the academic markets, could you just give a sense of how you are seeing spending there? Is there any reason to believe that spending patterns in the fourth quarter will be different than previous periods where you've had a CR or is there some dynamic ahead of 2016 that you might think would be pertinent?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, we've been growing low-single-digits in the end market. It's very hard to forecast what's going to happen with the U.S. government. Clearly, we play a very active role in making sure that the government stays open and I do actually spend time on that because it's disruptive to our customers when we get into that debate. But right now, it looks like at least for the next month or two, it looks like things will continue to be funded and hopefully we'll get to a period where we get out of this very short term environment. There's some really better things on the mid-term, the 21st Century Cures and so just a general dialog around the NIH is much more positive. So if we can ever get to a period where we can get a budget done, we should benefit as our customers will benefit from improved funding.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "All right. Okay. Thanks very much.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. Thanks a bunch. First question on pharma, could you maybe comment on the strength you saw this quarter, the extent to which you thought market share might have helped relative to the actual growth rate in the underlying end markets?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Isaac, it's pretty hard to pin down what the market share is versus the end market. I need to see what some of the other companies report to get the very crisp feel to that. But what I would say is in that growth there's not, like, big account flips. What it really is is just good share of wallet execution, just picking up share at our existing customers, driving more biosciences revenue, capitalizing on our strength of biopharma services, and bioproduction continues to be very strong for us.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Great. And then just a follow up on diagnostics, if we look at sort of the nine months year-to-date trend over a couple of years, the two-year stacked comp, so to speak, kind of looks like a low-single-digit number. I imagine your ambitions in diagnostics are to grow a little faster. What do you think is going to take to sort of realize the sustained growth rate that's above the corporate average?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so in terms of the business there, when I think about the mid-term for the business and the long-term, we have some really cool products in the product development pipeline that we've foreshadowed a little bit and you're seeing some of the earlier versions of those. That will help drive very good long-term growth. In the short-term at this level, I would say primarily, what you're looking at is you've got one contract that we're just sunsetting at the end of the fourth quarter that creates a little bit of a headwind this year. But other than that, it's pretty normal rate (52:32) in terms of where it is. So I love the long-term outlook and it's a great profit generator for us with moderate growth in the very short-term as we've been going through this expiration.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks a bunch.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the questions. Just a couple of follow-ups. Maybe I'll start first on the revenue synergies. You spoke in some detail about how revenue synergies with the integration are going this year, tracking a little ahead of plan. I wonder if you could give us a bit of incremental color on how that's tracking, specifically where are you seeing things play out a little bit better than you might have expected.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve, great question. So really what you are seeing is things are driving results faster. They are materializing a little faster than we expected, so basically our revenue synergy plans were kind of zero in year one, $60 million in year two, $150 million in year three. That was roughly the ramp-up. And we'll do a little better than $60 million and it puts us in a great position to achieve the $150 million.", "The thing that is a real highlight for us in this year, in the second year of our integration, really is is how effectively the channel business and our Life Sciences Solutions businesses are working together. So that execution has gone very well. What's to come is more around the e-commerce platform and leveraging that. And you probably have noticed that the thermofisher.com looks differently than it did a few months ago. And you now see it much more commerce-oriented as we integrated a couple of our key web properties. And you'll see more product access on that platform over time. So we have a lot of really cool things in process. Our customers are recognizing it and it's really helping drive nice growth for the company and nice growth for the Life Sciences Solutions segment.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then the last one for me actually comes back to pharma, maybe a little bit of a finer point. As you think about end of year and the tendency for budget flush in pharma, how are you budgeting for that potential budget flush? Do you assume that there is a budget flush? And if so, is it similar to last year, higher or lower? How are you thinking about those dynamics?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So \u2013 Steve, thanks. It is always challenging to know how customers will spend at the end of the year. The last two years we've had very strong year end spending. We assume a reasonable level of year-end spend. And when I think about the fourth quarter, as I just think about, sort of, how to look at the revenue growth, what you have is the benefit of an extra day, which is good. And you have a very challenging comparison, which is a headwind. But when we put it all together, we still feel very good about our ability to deliver the 4% organic growth for the full year. So that's our view and you really don't know on the budget flush, literally until the last two weeks of the year, is really how that plays out.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks again.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "You've done a solid job this year offsetting the FX headwinds with cost actions. Should we expect any variable costs to come back into the model next year?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No. In terms of the way we've managed through it, basically, we've pushed pricing harder, selectively. We're having a good year on pricing. We did manage our cost base tightly. We always manage our cost base tightly. We put a little bit more emphasis. But we did the right things for the long-term health of the business as well. So you're not going to see cost come back in because of something we did this year. In fact, you'll see us drive meaningful productivity as we get into 2016 as well.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. And then one more follow-up for Stephen. In terms of the full year free cash flow outlook of $2.6 billion. I mean, that would imply about as much cash as you've generated year-to-date coming in the fourth quarter. Can you just help me bridge the dynamics of really how you get there in the fourth quarter? Is there anything one time or unique?", "Stephen Williamson - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, sure, Brandon. So, yeah, so we're just over $1.3 billion year-to-date. And when I look at Q4, Q4 is always, historically, our strongest cash flow quarter. And then when you think about the year-over-year dynamic, two significant items, really, cash taxes and cash interest in 2015 have pretty much largely been done in the first three quarters, which wasn't the case last year. So very little cash tax, cash interest payments in Q4, which helps us drive a strong cash flow \u2013 free cash flow in Q4.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Super. Thank you.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "And operator, we're going to take one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott from Robert W Baird. Please go ahead.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, thanks for sneaking me in. Really, had two follow-ups on the last set of questions. Marc, you talked about pricing being strong selectively. I guess, can you give us an update on where pricing is at? And the second follow up is on PPI. Obviously, that program has been a huge home run for you guys. Can you talk about your visibility into future initiatives to help keep up that strong pace of margin expansion that you've been seeing?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So pricing, which over the last few years has bounced around between 0.5% and 1%, it's probably in the range of about 0.75% year-to-date, Q3 was stronger than that. So we're having a good year on pricing from that perspective. And in terms of PPI, it's who we are. Right? I mean it's how we operate, it's how we come to work every day in terms of driving productivity and efficiency and it will drive meaningful opportunities. When we talked about our longer term goals of getting our margins to 24% to 26%, PPI is a key contributor to doing that and it gives us great confidence in our ability to have really solid growth prospects in terms of earnings for many, many, many years to come.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So with that let me wrap it up with just a couple of quick things. One, thanks for joining us today. We had another solid quarter. We're in a great position to deliver another very strong year at Thermo Fisher Scientific and we look forward to reviewing our year-end results in early February.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investor section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcast & Presentations until February 26, 2016. A copy of the press release of our fourth quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement. Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.", "Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the company's Annual Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 26, 2015 under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available on the Investors section of our website under the heading SEC Filings.", "While we may elect to update future-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call, we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2015 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone, and thanks, of course, for joining us today for our Q4 and year-end call. As you saw in our press release, we ended the year on a very strong note, delivering excellent fourth quarter results. Our teams identified and capitalized on year-end opportunities, delivered our value proposition to help our customers meet their objectives, and executed well to achieve our goals for the year.", "I think our performance demonstrates that no matter what we're facing in the macro environment, we have many opportunities to gain share. At the same time, we're steadily expanding our capabilities in line with our growth strategy, and this gives us even more potential to create value for all of our key stakeholders: customers, employees and shareholders.", "I'll cover some of my business highlights of the quarter and the year later on in my remarks, but first I'll give you a summary of our financial performance, discuss our growth relative to our key end markets, and wrap up with an overview of our annual guidance for 2016.", "So starting with the quarter, we grew our adjusted earnings per share by 7% to $2.12, continuing our long track record of strong adjusted EPS performance. Our revenue in Q4 grew 4% year-over-year, our adjusted operating income increased 5%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23.2%.", "Looking at our Q4 performance in the context of our key end markets, I'm pleased to say that we did a great job of capitalizing on year-end opportunities to deliver strong growth overall. Starting with industrial and applied, our performance was similar to what we've seen all year with very low single-digit growth. Our industrial businesses remained soft while our businesses serving applied markets continued to perform well, particularly our analytical instruments used for environmental and food safety applications.", "As an example, I'm very pleased with the performance of our chromatography business. Some of this is due to the success of the Vanquish UHPLC system we launched a little over a year ago. But fundamentally, the benefits of the Dionex acquisition in 2011 are really playing out. We're seeing strength across our entire portfolio from HPLC to GC to ion chromatography as well as software and consumables.", "Turning to diagnostics and healthcare, it was good to see stronger results in this end market in Q4. We delivered mid-single-digit growth with especially strong performance in our clinical diagnostics and immunodiagnostics businesses.", "In academic and government, conditions in this end market were the strongest we've seen all year. We executed well to take advantage of strong spending at the end of the year in the U.S. and Europe and we delivered mid-single-digit growth. It's good to see positive momentum in this end market, and we're encouraged about our prospects here given the more favorable funding environment in the U.S. in 2016.", "Last, I'm pleased to say that we capped off a very strong year in pharma and biotech with another outstanding quarter with growth in the mid-teens. We're clearly benefiting from the underlying strength of this end market and the power of our customer value proposition, which is creating a significant competitive advantage for us and drove strong performance across our businesses that served this end market.", "Our results show that in this economic environment, our customers turn to us to help them be successful, whether they're driving more innovation or increasing productivity to fund those R&D investments. Our scale and depth of capabilities is a key differentiator that creates value for our customers across our end markets.", "So in summary, we took full advantage of the year-end opportunities, executed well and delivered very strong Q4 performance that led to a great year overall.", "Now, I'll transition to our full year results. The main take-away is very clear: we achieved all the goals we set out to achieve. It wasn't the easiest of environments, but with thoughtful planning, great operational execution and intense focus on our customers, we delivered another strong year.", "Among our key objectives in 2015, we focused on meeting or exceeding our financial commitments, making good progress in advancing our growth strategy, capturing the synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition and strengthening our balance sheet.", "I'm pleased to report that we accomplished each of these objectives and I'll cover them in a bit more detail, starting with the financials.", "Obviously, it was a challenging environment from an FX perspective and the strengthening of the dollar impacted every multinational company. But we effectively navigated those headwinds, which Stephen will discuss later in his remarks, and achieved what I feel was a very solid year.", "We delivered $7.39 of adjusted EPS, which was a 6% increase year-over-year despite an 11% headwind from foreign exchange. We grew revenues to a record $16.97 billion for the full year. Adjusted operating income increased 3%, and we achieved adjusted operating income margin of 60 basis points to 22.5%.", "Let me take a moment here to give you some insight into how we're thinking about margin expansion. As you know, we've been able to steadily expand our operating margins over the years. We do this by leveraging our PPI Business System and all the levers we have to drive margins, whether it's pricing, sourcing or footprint optimization.", "You can see in our results that we did a great job of expanding margins despite a very significant FX headwind. Given that we will continue to face FX challenges in 2016, we remain very focused on driving productivity by continuing to use our operational levers.", "We've also decided to take some additional actions that will help us further down the road. We will fund those additional productivity actions through the benefits we gain from the temporary repeal of the medical device tax. This will enable us to further strengthen our operating margins going into 2017. We have a substantial opportunity to expand our margins and we still think it's reasonable to take them to the 24% to 26% range by 2018.", "So we delivered solid performance for the year by staying true to our growth strategy and making sure that every decision we made put us in a stronger position in the eyes of our customers.", "Now, let me hit some of the highlights and accomplishments from the year and from the quarter in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, it's based on three elements: developing high-impact innovative new products, capitalizing on our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and leveraging our unique customer value proposition. The success of this strategy creates a significant competitive advantage for us and that gives us many opportunities to gain share.", "Starting with innovation, 2015 was another very strong year for us. I covered our new product highlights during the course of the year, so I'm not going to get into much detail today. We did have strong launches serving the research scientists as well as for our customers working in clinical and applied markets.", "Starting with the research community, the big news last year was our launch of the Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer for proteomics. We actually just learned yesterday that the Lumos was voted by customers who read SelectScience magazine as the Best New Drug Discovery Product of 2015. Our industry-leading Orbitrap platform gives us a foundation for expansion into a range of applications, and we continue to fully leverage that capability.", "We also had a number of exciting products launched in genetic analysis, but let me just mention a couple of them. One was our cloud-enabled QuantStudio 3 and 5 real-time qPCR systems, which support our increasing focus on oncology. The other was the new Ion S5 and S5 XL product line, which makes targeted next-gen sequencing more accessible for a range of research applications.", "Moving to the clinic, we introduced a number of new immunoassays during the year as well as a new Phadia instrument that effectively leverages our customers' capital investment by running tests for both allergy and autoimmunity.", "One example from the quarter that I do want to highlight is our collaboration with the Karolinska Institute of Sweden on a groundbreaking clinical study aimed at developing a more effective test for prostate cancer. Using our proteomic, genomic and assay technologies, this test can predict, or more precisely, distinguish between benign and aggressive cancers, thus reducing the number of biopsies required without compromising the number of actual cancers diagnosed. These are early days and there's still much more work here to be done, but it's very exciting and may be an alternative to the PSA test. This development would not have happened without the ability to leverage all of these capabilities across our company.", "Turning to applied markets, our new Q Exactive Focus LC/MS created a powerful alternative to Q-TOF technology for a number of applications, including toxicology, pharma QA/QC, food and environmental analysis as well. The Focus is really gaining traction and significantly contributed to our growth in our Analytical Instruments business in Q4.", "So as you can see, 2015 was another outstanding year for innovation. We put our R&D dollars and expertise to work to deliver high-impact products that help our customers achieve their goals. I look forward to discussing the exciting innovations we plan to launch during 2016 as the year unfolds.", "Let me now turn to the second element of our growth strategy, which is about using our scale as a competitive advantage in Asia Pacific and emerging markets. You saw in our press release that we highlighted China growth. Well, I have to steal Stephen's thunder a little by telling you that we achieved high-teens growth in China in Q4. Really outstanding performance by the team.", "The question I get a lot with China is how have we been doing so well given the magnitude of change taking place in that country. Well, from my perspective, I think it boils down to two things. First, China has challenges that we are in the best position to help our customers address, like poor air and water quality, unsafe food supplies, and strains on their healthcare system.", "The second reason is that we've taken advantage of our scale but also have a very localized approach to running our business there. We have a team that understands the market and where the funding is and has executed very well.", "Let me give you one example from the quarter, which is a new product we launched from our China Innovation Center in Shanghai. Contaminated water is a big issue there and some important new regulations were put in place by the government to control various water pollutants. We worked closely with our customers to understand their requirements and launched the Orion 3106 COD water analyzer in Q4. In addition to it detecting pollutants, this new product will also help our customers lower their operating costs by reducing maintenance and reagent consumption.", "During the year, we also expanded our capabilities to capture opportunities in other emerging markets such as Southeast Asia. Our most recent development was the November opening of a new GMP biopharma clinical services facility in Singapore to serve the growing needs of pharma and biotech customers in the region.", "Our strong performance in 2015 shows that we're effectively leveraging our global scale to best serve our customers and drive growth.", "Turning to our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy. I think the best example here is our successful integration of Life Technologies. We had high expectations for this business when we acquired it two years ago, and it's been a home run for us, not only in terms of the financial benefits but also in strengthening our customer offering and the strategic position of our company.", "Regarding the financials, the metrics we laid out in early 2015, which were higher than the original deal model, were $115 million of additional cost synergies and $60 million of revenue synergies for the year. I'm very pleased to report that in 2015, we delivered $130 million of cost synergies and ended the year at our target year three run rate.", "In terms of revenue synergies, we really gained early traction here and achieved approximately $90 million of revenue synergies in 2015, much faster than we anticipated. This performance puts us in a great position to achieve our 2016 revenue synergy goals.", "From a customer perspective, we have a clear advantage as a result of combining our capabilities across the company. Our bioproduction and biosciences businesses are now growing faster than they were independently.", "Having genetic and protein analysis technologies in one company is creating exciting new opportunities, like the prostate cancer test I mentioned earlier. And the commercial presence we now have by combining our channel and e-commerce capabilities is really starting to drive growth.", "In terms of our strategic position, at our Analyst Meeting last May we said we expected Life Sciences Solutions to grow organically at 3% or better for the year, and I'm very pleased to report that the business grew organically at 5% in 2015, which contributed to our strong performance for the company overall. This is a great example of how we put our capital to work to create value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Let me now give you a quick update on our balance sheet. You know that last year we were focused on delevering, following the Life Technologies acquisition. I'm pleased to tell you that we achieved our target leverage ratio of 3 times leverage at the end of 2015.", "This timing is slightly ahead of what we expected when we announced the transaction, and we accomplished this while repurchasing $500 million of our stock early last year and paying about $240 million of dividends as well as spending $700 million on two complementary bolt-on acquisitions.", "To remind you, ASI strengthened our capabilities, serving the high-growth bioproduction market, and Alfa Aesar expanded our offering of chemicals for the research laboratory.", "So we put ourselves in a great position from a balance sheet perspective as we begin 2016, and we're able to kick off the year by announcing our agreement to acquire Affymetrix. Many of you are familiar with this business, which is a leader in cellular and genetic analysis. Affymetrix has a strong position on flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. It was also the pioneer of microarray technology and will be a nice complement to our genetic sciences business.", "This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect $0.10 of adjusted EPS accretion in the first full year of ownership, and we also expect to generate $70 million of synergies by year three following the close. So, good financial returns and also a very good fit for our Life Sciences Solutions business.", "Let me now turn to our guidance for 2016. Stephen will cover the details and outline all of the assumptions for our revenue and earnings guidance, but I'd like to make a couple of comments.", "Our 2016 guidance reflects the fact that foreign exchange will continue to have a negative impact on our top and bottom line performance, although we anticipate to a lesser degree than it did in 2015 based on where rates are today.", "So, we're guiding to adjusted EPS in the range of $7.80 to $7.96. This would result in 6% to 8% growth over the $7.39 we delivered in 2015. In terms of the revenues, we expect to deliver between $17.36 billion and $17.56 billion in 2016.", "So before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me leave with you a few take-aways. We focused on our customers and effectively navigated the macro environment to achieve our goals for the year. We continued to innovate, expand our global reach, and enhance our customer value proposition in line with our growth strategy. We also strengthened our balance sheet so we can resume our normal capital deployment in 2016 and identify new opportunities to create shareholder value.", "With that, I'll now hand over the call to Stephen Williamson, our CFO. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Marc and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our Q4 and full year 2015 financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with a detailed review of our 2016 guidance.", "So starting with our overall financial performance for the fourth quarter, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 7% to $2.12. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $7.39, up 6% from 2014. The midpoint of our guidance that we gave you at the end of Q3 was $7.37 of adjusted EPS for the full year 2015. Subsequent to this guidance, the negative foreign exchange impact on Q4 increased significantly, resulting in a further $0.06 of headwind in the quarter. I'm pleased to say that we're able to offset all of this and still able to deliver $7.39 for the full year, $0.02 more than the midpoint of our last guidance.", "GAAP EPS was $1.50 in Q4, up 1% from $1.49 in the prior year's quarter and $4.92 for full year 2015, up 4% from $4.71 in 2014.", "On the top line, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth this quarter and our reported revenue increased 4% year over year. Q4 reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, and a 4% headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year 2015, reported revenue was flat year over year, and organic revenue growth was 5%.", "Full year reported revenue includes 1% growth from acquisitions, net of divestitures and a 6% negative impact from foreign exchange. Looking at the growth by geography in Q4, North America grew in the mid-single digits, and Europe grew in the high-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low double digits, and as Marc mentioned, China was growing in the high teens. And the rest of the world declined in the high-single digits.", "For the full year, both North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits and China growing in the mid-teens. And the rest of the world declined in the low-single digits.", "So looking at our operational performance Q4 adjusted operating income increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 40 basis points from Q4 last year, despite an 80 basis point headwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.5%, up 60 basis points from 2014, despite a 90 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.", "At a high level, our adjusted operating margin expansion from the quarter and the full year was driven by continued strong contribution from the PPI Business System productivity levers, including pricing, global sourcing and footprint optimization, as well as the continued contribution from cost synergies.", "In Q4, we realized $18 million of cost synergy benefits from the Life Technologies acquisition, and $130 million for the full year 2015. And as Marc said we were able to accelerate the capture of revenue synergies and realized $40 million during Q4 and $90 million for the full year 2015. This puts us in great position to deliver on the three-year run rate target of $150 million of revenue synergies in 2016.", "We took advantage of our strong performance in Q4 to make additional strategic investments primarily to strengthen our commercial capabilities and to accelerate growth.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 47.7% in Q4, down 130 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.3%, down 50 basis points from 2014. The decreases in gross margin in both Q4 and the full year are primarily attributed to foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix.", "Adjusted SG&A in Q4 was 20.6% of revenue, which is 150 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, driven primarily by foreign exchange, cost synergies, and our productivity actions.", "For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 21.7%, 120 basis points favorable to 2014. And finally R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue in Q4, 20 basis points favorable to Q4 2014, and full year R&D expense was 4.1%, flat to full year 2014. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for full year 2015 was 6.4%, also flat to the full year 2014.", "So looking at our results below the line, net interest expense in Q4 was $94 million, down $13 million from Q4 last year, as result of reducing our debt over the past 12 months. Net interest expense for the full year was $384 million, a decrease of $48 million from 2014. Adjusted other income for Q4 was negative $7 million, $16 million lower than Q4 2014, and for the full year, it was $6 million, which is $7 million lower than last year. Both driven primarily by non-operating foreign exchange net losses in 2015, compared to net gains in 2014. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13%, 20 basis points below last year.", "Our full year rate was 13.7%, down from 14.5% in 2014, primarily as a result of realizing our benefits of our acquisition tax planning. And average diluted shares were 402.4 million in Q4, down 1.7 million year over year, primarily as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 401.9 million, down 0.4 million from 2014.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the year was $2.83 billion, and free cash flow was $2.42 billion, after deducting net capital expenditure of $405 million. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance due to additional investments in working capital. We ended the year with $455 million in cash and investments. During 2015, we continued to return capital to shareholders with $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and $240 million of dividends, including $60 million of dividends in Q4.", "We also continued to make strategic acquisitions in 2015, spending $300 million in Q1 to acquire ASI, and $400 million in Q4 to acquire Alfa Aesar. Our total debt at the end of Q4 was $12.5 billion, down $800 million sequentially from Q3 and we achieved our year-end target leverage ratio of 3 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, we continue to make progress on our ROIC. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC in Q4 was 9.5%, up 20 basis points sequentially from Q3 and up 60 basis points from Q1 2015, when the Life Technologies acquisition was fully included in the average investment base.", "So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a significant headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted their year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margins to varying degrees.", "Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 2% in Q4 and organic revenue grew 5%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue grew 6% on organic growth of 5%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 5% and adjusted operating margin was 31.6%, up 80 basis points, benefiting from very strong productivity and incremental cost synergies, partially offset by some unfavorable product mix, significantly unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments.", "For the full year 2015, adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, 110 basis points higher than the prior year.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 3% in Q4 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spectrometry businesses, partially offset by weaknesses that we continue to see in some of our core industrial markets.", "For the full year, reported revenue declined 1%, and organic growth was 4%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 13%, and adjusted operating margin was 22.1%, up 190 basis points.", "We delivered very strong productivity in this segment, partially offset by foreign exchange, unfavorable mix and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 19.1%, 120 basis points higher than 2014.", "Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, total revenue grew slightly and organic revenue growth was 4%. This was driven by good growth in our immunodiagnostics and clinical diagnostics businesses, partially offset by the expiration of the OEM contract that I mentioned on our Q3 call. For the full year, reported revenue declined 3%, and organic growth was 3%.", "Adjusted operating income in the segment decreased 3% in Q4 and adjusted operating margin was 26.2%, down 90 basis points from the prior year. In the segment, we drove very good productivity; however this was more than offset by the expiration of the OEM contract, unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic growth investments. For the full year 2015, adjusted operating income decreased 5%, and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 50 basis points from 2014.", "And finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 8%, and organic revenue growth was 10%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market with the biopharma services channel and Laboratory Products businesses all delivering very strong growth. For the full year, reported revenue grew 1% and organic revenue grew 7%. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, up 20 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by productivity improvements partially offset by strategic growth investments. For full year 2015, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusting operating margin was 15%, up 10 basis points from the prior year.", "So with that, I'd like to review the details of our 2016 guidance. Consistent with our usual practice, our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures. As a result, it does not include the impact of our recently announced Affymetrix acquisition, which we expect to close by the end of Q2. We will update our guidance after that deal closes. As Marc mentioned, we're initiating a 2016 adjusted EPS guidance range of $7.80 to $7.96, which represents growth of 6% to 8% over our 2015 adjusted EPS of $7.39.", "In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $17.36 billion to $17.56 billion, which represents growth of about 2.5% to 3.5% versus our reported revenue of $16.97 billion in 2015. On an organic basis, our revenue range assumes an organic growth midpoint of about 4%. As Marc mentioned, we're seeing another year of negative impact on both the top and bottom line as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus major foreign currencies.", "As always, we're focused on our reported numbers, but I thought I'd give you a bit more color on the foreign exchange to give you some perspective on how it's impacting our guidance. On the top line, foreign exchange is lowering our revenue by approximately $290 million, which equates to just under a 2% revenue headwind. Foreign currency is reducing our adjusted EPS growth by $0.19, or just over 2.5%. If you were to look at our 2015 guidance or our 2016 guidance on an FX-neutral basis, adjusted EPS growth would be in the range of 8% to 10%, which represents another strong year of underlying operating performance. Consistent with past practice, our guidance assumes current foreign currency exchange rates, and we haven't attempted to forecast future changes in rates.", "Moving on to the details of our guidance, acquisitions completed in 2015 are expected to contribute about $100 million or 60 basis points to our reported revenue growth in 2016.", "Giving some color on our assumptions on growth by end market, starting with pharma and biotech, we expect strong performance in this market \u2013 in that market in 2016, and assume mid to high single-digit growth over our very strong low teens growth in 2015. In academic and government, with a better funding environment in the U.S., we expect growth in this end market to improve around the company average. And we expect growth in diagnostics and healthcare to be slightly better in 2016 as well, also growing around the company average. And in industrial and applied, we don't expect any improvement year over year, with growth remaining flat to 2015.", "Turning to adjusted operating margins, we're expecting around 60 to 70 basis points of expansion year over year. Strong productivity and acquisition synergies will be partially offset by strategic growth investments and the impact of foreign exchange. I will walk you through each of these elements of our margin expansion. So starting with productivity. Here we will continue to use the proven productivity levers of our PPI Business System, including pricing, volume leverage, global sourcing and footprint optimization. These will continue to have a very positive impact on our margin profile. In terms of synergies from the Life Technologies acquisition, we expect to deliver $55 million of year-over-year cost synergy benefit in 2016, and we expect to realize a further $60 million of revenue synergies, which will yield approximately $20 million of adjusted operating income benefit. This will enable us to deliver the three-year goal of $350 million of total cost and revenue synergies in 2016.", "During the year, we will continue to make strategic investments to continue to drive growth, enhance the impact of innovation, and to improve our customer experience. It was good to see the repeal of the medical device tax in the recently approved federal budget. Unfortunately, it's only repealed for two years, not eliminated entirely. However, as Marc mentioned, we're going to take advantage of this opportunity and plan to reinvest the approximately $15 million of annual impact of the repeal back into the business. The majority will go towards accelerating our long-term productivity initiatives to help counteract some of the impact that foreign exchange has had on our operating margins.", "In terms of pull-through on the foreign exchange headwind, we're expecting an unfavorable impact on the bottom line totaling $90 million or 30% average margin. This creates 10 basis points of adjusted operating margin dilution. If you were to look at our 2016 adjusted operating margin guidance on an FX-neutral basis, our margin expansion would be 70 basis points to 80 basis points. We will continue to look for ways to minimize the impact of foreign exchange on our P&L.", "Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $370 million to $380 million, about $10 million lower than 2015, primarily as a result of the debt reduction actions taken in 2015. For 2016, we are assuming that we will refinance our debt as it matures; we are not planning any further pay down of debt during the year. We're expecting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, slightly higher than 2015. And in terms of capital deployment, we're assuming that we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends. The guidance assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2016, which we've already completed in January. There is no other capital deployment assumed in this guidance.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 401 million to 402 million, down slightly from 2015 with the impact of the buybacks offsetting option dilution. We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $440 million. And finally, in terms of full year 2016 free cash flow, we're expecting between $2.68 \u2013 we are expecting about $2.68 billion, up $260 million compared to 2015.", "As a final note from guidance, I wanted to highlight the calendar timing within 2016. Our Q1 2016 fiscal calendar has four more days than Q1 2015. And our Q4 2016 fiscal calendar has four less days than Q4 2015, with no net overall impact for the year. As you know, we do not give quarterly guidance, but given the scale of the days difference, I thought it would be helpful to give you some insight on what we are expecting for Q1 2016. With about 4% organic growth for the full year 2016, we're assuming about 7% growth in Q1. In terms of margin expansion, because we have four extra days of costs in Q1 2016, we are assuming that margins will be flat versus Q1 2015.", "As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view on how we see things playing out. Results above or below the midpoint will depend on the relative strength of our markets as well as foreign exchange rate fluctuations during the rest of the year.", "So in summary, we're pleased to deliver a strong finish to the year, and that positions us well to achieve our financial goals for 2016.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now conduct the question-and-answer session. Your first question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. So, I think we're all a little bit surprised that the EPS guidance is a little bit lower for 2016 than we had anticipated. I guess \u2013 I mean, Stephen, you went through a number of the ones, I think where our model was off. I think we had the share count was a little higher and the interest expense was a little bit higher, I think, sort of giving the biggest hits there.", "But can you just talk a little bit more about sort of like the mix impacts? If I remember correctly from the old Invitrogen, Life days, as that business sort of picks up, it has a much bigger impact in terms of the hit to the gross margin on that business from FX. I guess, can you talk a little bit more about sort of like mix dynamics, how that's playing out and sort of \u2013 you obviously are seeing stronger strength in the LPS business, and just sort of walk through what's going on and just sort of how you're thinking about sort of the product mix here and how much of that is impacting the business?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Derik, I'll start and then Stephen will add to it. So, thanks for the question. There's $0.19 of FX headwind in the 2016 numbers, right? So, that's actually what the big thing that needs to be understood, right? There was $0.06 incremental after our guidance in the fourth quarter that we drove past and actually beat.", "So when you take it, 6% to 8% is our guidance for the year; on an FX-neutral basis, it's 8% to 10%. And obviously, it's only assuming the $500 million of capital deployment, which is the buybacks we already did in 2016. Obviously, we're going to get the benefit of Affymetrix later in the year. And we obviously have tremendous amount of capacity to do other things. We just don't want to decide exactly what we're going to do, sitting here, at the end of January, but there are things that we will do to drive more but we wanted to provide absolute clarity of very strong underlying operating performance, big FX headwind that we're working our way through and lots of balance sheet opportunity down the road.", "Stephen, anything you want to talk about on mix?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, mix, no, nothing unusual in the mix side that's driving anything positive or negative in 2016.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And just one quick follow-up question. When you sort of look at the end markets, what are sort of your expectations in terms of China and Latin America and sort of how does that flow into 2016?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So from a geographic perspective, we executed very well in China during the course of last year. We clearly gained share from everything that we've heard from others. And we're expecting China to be one of our fastest-growing markets, probably low-double-digit type growth. It's hard to predict exactly but it will be a nice contributor to our growth for this year.", "For Latin America, Brazil was very soft last year. It's not a huge market for us and we're not assuming any improvement in our numbers. You can see it when Stephen was talking about rest of world. That's primarily Latin America declined a little bit last year and we're assuming a similar type environment.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks. I'll get back in the queue.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Derik.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hi. Good morning, guys. So, I guess as you guys were sort of staring at the consensus estimates and the $8 to $8.18 range, and you guys were contemplating where the guidance was and you were feeling where there were pushes and pulls in the P&L and where the Street had sort of gotten it wrong.", "I mean I guess what was sort of the internal debate around what you could push forward, whether or not \u2013 Affy [Affymetrix], which obviously pushed off some cap allocation, e.g., you could have done more buyback, had you not done that and that may have helped, I guess, versus the range but longer term may not have been the right decision.", "I guess, what were some of the key debate points? And then from a messaging perspective, do you feel like you kind of outlined enough for us to have figured this out more so than we did or do you think it really, with some of the macro moves, whether it was FX, et cetera, in the back half of the year, that stuff was moving around too much and it was difficult to sort of message?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Ross, great question. There was no debate. We run the company to do the right thing for our shareholders and for our customers. We don't sit there and say that the consensus is right or wrong. We say what is great operating performance and great use of our capital to create shareholder value.", "So literally, there was zero debate. We look at what's out there externally. I mean that's why you heard longer remarks today, to really provide clarity on how we're thinking about the world.", "I think the things that I would take away so that you can look to the future is, one, when we started out 2015 and you looked at our guidance range, we said the following: we would do all of our best without damaging the bright future that the company has to offset the FX headwinds. Last year, we picked up 2% incremental EPS headwinds after our original guidance. We offset all of it and we're able to deliver the high end of our original guidance.", "When we look at this year, we have a number of actions that we're taking to chip away that FX, but which is why Stephen and I talked a little bit about, we don't just stop. We're actually taking other actions that ensure that if we continue to live in a tough FX environment, that 2017 will also be a fantastic year for the company. So, we're very proactively managing the business.", "In terms of the capital deployment, hey, we spent \u2013 committed $1.8 billion in the, what, first two weeks of the year. I think we're being pretty aggressive. And it doesn't matter which month these different things happen. We're using our competitive position to create value for shareholders. So, we have incredibly bright prospects and I know that the analysts will look at the numbers and feel good about them.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "So, when you think about \u2013 obviously, again, this is a tough macro, so clearly the underlying ex FX is pretty good growth. Where do you see the biggest pushes and pulls just from an economic perspective in terms of some of the volatility? Obviously, we've looked at what's happened to the biotech sector and people worry about funding. There's been, obviously, the industrial side, some dislocations in parts of the world. FX movements have been a big deal. When you look at where the pushes and pulls are in the guide where you can really have on a top line basis sort of a differentiated outcome, where do you see the most sensitivity, I guess?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, so, Ross, so if you think about last year, we entered the year with a challenging environment. We delivered our strongest organic growth of 5% in a long time, right? And delivered it very solidly despite the fact that not every end market was robust.", "When we think about this year, we're assuming, as we did last year, we'll finish with about 4%. That's what we're targeting, but if we can do better we will. And if I think about the environment, one, academic and government, a little bit better than last year because of NIH funding. So we're expecting to be at the company average, which is better than the low-single digits last year. Diagnostics and healthcare, we're also expecting to be at the company average or about the company average, which is a little bit better than last year.", "The big swing factor is going to be biopharma. And it's not going to be the end market conditions; it's just going to be, we had a teens growth or low-double-digit growth last year and we're assuming from a starting point that we're going to grow mid- to high-single digits against the tough comps.", "So, that's the swing factor on the upside to it. And the team has done a good job over the last five years, six years, seven years of executing in that segment, and we'll keep you posted on how we do. So, I think it gives you good sense of how we're thinking about the world.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Great. Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. A question on the restructuring initiatives you talked about. If you look at kind of what's going on in the industrial world, all these companies are taking pretty aggressive restructuring actions. Can you maybe talk about whether this is the first of potentially several steps, whether you think you're doing enough with this initial step, and how you came to kind of the magnitude of the initial restructuring?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our business is growing 5% organically, so we're not in restructuring mode. What we're doing is saying we want to ensure we're going to drive strong profitability growth for the long term and there are things that we can do that have good paybacks but cost a bunch of money up front in terms of optimizing facilities and you have double costs, those kinds of things. So, we're getting them underway now so that when those things are put into place, basically in 2017, you get a further tailwind on restructuring.", "We've managed this company through multiple recessions. Both Stephen and I have been here 15 years, right? But right now, end markets are good. Bookings were very strong, right? So if something happens that slows growth down, we know how to take the actions to drive short-term profit growth to deal with a tough environment.", "But we ended the year with our best quarter in many years and very strong bookings. So, we're just doing the prudent things to drive earnings growth and we'll monitor the end markets very, very closely.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then on capital deployment, as you get back in the back half of the year, should we think about maybe more emphasis on buybacks in light of the multiples you're seeing from an M&A standpoint right now?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "What I would say is that we have a significant capacity to deploy, and we will look at what is the right thing for the shareholder base as the months unfold this year, whether it's more buybacks or more M&A opportunities. We're evaluating the different choices. We got a good M&A pipeline. We have an attractive stock. So, you'll see us continue to be active as the year unfolds.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Then, last one for Stephen. Can you just quantify the extra day impact?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The extra day impact in Q4?", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Correct.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I'm sure it contributed to the overall number, but it's not a significant part of the growth.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking the questions. I'm going to do my best to try to put words in your mouth. As I listen to the commentary around the strength of the order funnel, the commentary around end market outlooks for 2016, it sounds like the one growth consideration that might drive a bit of incremental slowing is a normal and appropriate degree of caution around pharma, just because the comps are simply tough, no signal of slowing in the order funnel. So as I look at the model and I say, okay, there's a guide for 7% organic in the first quarter, 4% for the full year, it implies some slowing over the balance of the year. I want to say that's just because we're taking a conservative view on how pharma plays out here in the early days of the year. Is that the right way to think about it?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve, everything is accurate up until the calendarization issue. So we're being prudent on the full year guidance, because we have a tough comparison in biopharma. Our aspirations, of course, will be high, and we'll keep you posted. The layout for the calendarization is we literally have almost a full extra week in Q1 and obviously a full \u2013 almost a full less week in Q4. So from a modeling perspective, roughly 7% in the first quarter, and obviously a bigger offset in Q4, kind of still gets to the 4%. So we are actually assuming kind of level activity, and the calendar just leads you to 7% in the first quarter. So don't read into anything beyond that.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And an extra week historically has generated maybe 2 points, 3 points of incremental growth \u2013 is that a fair number?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The last time we had an extra week, we were coming off one of the worst recessions ever. So I don't think there's a norm when it comes to it, so we feel good at this point with \u2013 about 7% for Q1.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then just one housekeeping question for me. I wonder if you could put numbers around some of the items that we're thinking about on the P&L for this year. I mean, we have got a little bit of a tailwind from the NIH, maybe that's a couple pennies. The R&D credit you called out, and \u2013 I'm sorry, the medtech tax you called out, the R&D credit I know was passed, and we have that for 2016. Could you quantify any of these for us?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Well, the medical device tax grossed about $15 million, and as we said, we're going to reinvest that. The R&D tax credit is about $23 million impact and that's in both years. So, there's no year-over-year impact, and NIH is part of the organic growth that we outlined in terms of the tailwind.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, organic growth, so a way to think about that one, Steve, would be for the company, it should be about 30 basis points of growth tailwind organically. Roughly a little more than a point in the academic and government end markets. So when you saw us being low single-digits last year, and about the company average this year, that really reflects the improved NIH funding. So hopefully that frames that up pretty well.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. Thanks so much.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question about your 2016 guidance, as it relates to gross margin. I don't think you guys gave a lot of color on what you're expecting there. But as I look at the fourth quarter performance, obviously, LPS had a great result, and that tends to be your lowest-margin division. So as I think about what you're looking for for this year, should we assume that out-performance in LPS could weigh a little bit on gross margin and accordingly drop through to EPS as well? I'm just trying to square up the other questions on the 2016 EPS guide.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. So I'm expecting a slight improvement in gross margins year over year in aggregate, and then the rest of the expansion comes from SG&A. So in terms of mix, I'm not expecting a dramatic change in mix the way that we're assuming that these things play out over the coming year.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. So if I had to kind of deconstruct the delta between sell side 2016, kind of consensus EPS and your guidance, it looks like it's mostly FX, and then maybe to a lesser extent share repurchase?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I \u2013 I don't know. I don't know what you are modeling, so we gave you \u2013 we gave the detailed guidance of what we are assuming in our model. So -", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Right, but assuming you guys have a view on what consensus numbers we're looking at, I just want to make sure I understood the sources of the delta.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Honestly, I have no idea what people are assuming for foreign exchange. The estimates give a top line and give an EPS number, and I don't see any detail there. So I can tell you what we have assumed in our model going forward.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Right. Right, no. I got the FX guidance. Thanks a bunch. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks and first of all, congratulations on a strong quarter. I think it was your highest growth rate since first quarter of 2010, if we're right here, so congratulations on that.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "I guess if I'm doing the math, it looks like on your organic growth, plus the life synergies you laid out, the life EBITDA synergies it kind of gives you $0.66 cents or so, and then you're talking about a 2% headwind from FX, you don't include any of the capital deployment. I guess I'm thinking a little bit further out, Marc, if you think about what you laid out at your analyst day on 2018, it sounds like you went out of your way to highlight that you still think the margin target is achievable. Kind of \u2013 what's your view on what you laid out at 2018 as what the EPS could look like? Has that changed at all today?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I mean, obviously, Jon, we'll get into that in May. We've never been concerned, even if we didn't take the actions about the ability to get to the 24 to 26 or drive a very strong performance that we outlined in May, but our goal is not to be at the lower end of that range. Our goal is to be at the higher end of that range, right? So we're taking the actions now to put us higher, you know, higher up in those ranges. So, when I think about last year, one of the things we got tremendously positive feedback was talking about philosophy and the philosophy of how we're dealing with FX, and I think what you're getting today is we're telling about you the philosophy that we \u2013 when we laid out our commitments in May, the world looks different, and we sort of don't care. We're going to navigate through it and deliver outstanding short and long-term financial performance and hence while picking a small point around a $15 million investment, I think it gives you the sense of the philosophy that we're very proactive in managing the business to deliver a really great financial performance.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just a quick follow-up, it looks like, one, just to clarify, it looks like you're not going to provide book-to-bill anymore and then what are your pricing expectations for 2016?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, so, actually, Jon, so I didn't give book-to-bill information. It's just not that relevant a metric for the company now, where we have over 75% recurring revenue stream. So, yes, for a large instruments business, it's a relevant metric. For us, it's \u2013 we just don't see it as that relevant. I didn't include it in my script and we don't include it in the recon package. Just so you know what the number is, it's actually slightly positive, 0.5% for Q4. So \u2013 but as I said, it's just not that relevant of a metric for us. And then in terms of your second question \u2013 I've completely forgotten what your second question was.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Just in terms of pricing benefit you expect in 2016.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. So, I think about the underlying pricing environment hasn't really changed from what we're seeing of our end markets from the last \u2013 really the last sort of three years or four years including this year. Now what we did in 2015 was drive some FX offset actions with some additional targeted price actions which brought our pricing number up. And we'll get a little bit of carryover from that, so pricing year over year in 2016, it will be very similar to 2015, so just over half a percent of price, but underlying, I don't think the pricing dynamics are significantly different in the industry.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Jon. So, operator, we have time for one more.", "Operator", "Certainly, your last question comes from the line of Jack Meehan from Barclays, please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I'm curious for the fourth quarter we have now seen a few years where the fourth quarter was seasonally stronger. I guess I'm curious what your view was on budget flushes toward the end of the year, what was sort of true growth in the fourth quarter and what might have \u2013 what we can be expecting in terms of the first quarter, whether there are some moving parts there.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, Jack, good question. So, the way the world is playing out over the last few years is that customers generally are being conservative early in the year, and I don't mean just one quarter but literally in first three quarters of the year, to deal with, you know, kind of unexpected adverse events whether they are macroeconomic or geopolitical. So we are seeing it across a wide range of customers where there's a conservatism. And as the year unfolds, and bad things really haven't happened, there's a much stronger year-end money, and we were very well positioned to capture it. Our team did a great job.", "When we look at the first quarter, because customers do a lot of activity late in the year, their demand is going to be a little bit softer but it's been a little bit softer in each of the previous few quarters. So I think as Stephen laid out the outlook for the year, that reflects the fact that customers start out conservatively and then build their spend as the year goes on. So I think we have that well characterized.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then just one follow-up similar to that, the academic segment, specifically, just given the NIH budget getting wrapped up toward year-end. What is your view? I think historically, it's been more the visibility around funding than the actual rate of growth itself. Just curious around the pace of some of that new funding going to work, what your expectations are for 2016.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so obviously, it's good news that our customers know that they can have better budgets. We think that some of that will be in Q1, but more likely Q2, Q3 is where you'll see the strength on the NIH-derived spending in terms of how the year will play out.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So let me wrap it up. We are very pleased to deliver another solid year. We're obviously looking forward to continuing that momentum in 2016, and, of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question and answer session.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin the call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, ThermoFisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations until May 13, 2016. A copy of the press release of our first quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations is available on the Investors section of the website under the heading Financial Results.", "So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so, even if our estimates change.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our first quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Ken, and good morning, everyone. We're pleased you could join us today for our Q1 call. As you saw in our press release, we're off to a strong start to the year. We delivered excellent growth in both revenue and adjusted EPS. Our great top and bottom line performance was the result of a few key factors: good growth across all of our major geographies, strong operational execution by our team, plus the added revenue benefit of four extra days in the quarter.", "We said last quarter that we expected to come out of the gate strong, and we did. In addition to great operational execution in Q1, we were also very active in capital deployment. We completed $1 billion of stock buybacks in the quarter, and we also closed on our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March, which was a quarter sooner than we originally planned. We're excited about the new opportunities we'll have with those added capabilities, and I'll talk a bit more about that later.", "I'll follow our usual format this morning, starting with the financial results and some commentary on our performance by end market. Then I'll cover a few of the business highlights from the quarter, provide an update on capital deployment, and wrap up with our revised guidance outlook.", "So starting with the financials. Revenue in Q1 grew 10% to $4.29 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 9%. In terms of our earnings performance, we continued our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS, with a 10% increase to $1.80 per share.", "Let me give you a high-level view of our Q1 performance in the context of our end markets. After a strong year-end finish, we've typically seen a weaker start in Q1, but that was obviously not the case this year, even if you normalize for the four extra days we had versus last year. In our key end markets, pharma and biotech was our strongest again this quarter, as it has been for some time. This was driven by excellent growth in our bioproduction, biopharma services, and biosciences businesses. Healthcare and diagnostics grew around the company average. Academic and government was slightly below the company average, and performance overall in industrial and applied remained muted, with continued weakness in industrial end markets and ongoing strength in applied. In aggregate, the dynamics across our end markets were good, with no material change from what we saw in 2015.", "Our strong results in Q1 reinforced that our scale and depth of capabilities are clear differentiators across our end markets. Let me now highlight some of our key accomplishments from the quarter, which show that we continue to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on developing high-impact, innovative new products, leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, and delivering our unique customer value proposition to gain share.", "So starting with innovation, we kicked off the year as we always do, with a strong showing at Pittcon, which you know is a major event in the U.S. for the analytical instruments industry. Over the past couple of years, Pittcon has really evolved into an opportunity for us to showcase our Thermo Scientific technologies for applied markets. Let me give you two quick examples, first in our mass spectrometry business, then in chromatography.", "In mass spec, we've been adapting the advanced capabilities of our Orbitrap platform for customers working outside the research lab, in applications such as food safety, forensic toxicology, and sports doping. Our recently launched Q Exactive Orbitrap GC-MS/MS is a great example of how we've combined gas chromatography with our Orbitrap capabilities so customers can perform a comprehensive sample analysis in a single run.", "In our chromatography business, the big headline at Pittcon this year was our new Integrion system, a real breakthrough in high-pressure ion chromatography. It gives customers working in busy environmental, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical laboratories a flexible system for creating highly efficient and accurate work flows. Integrion significantly raises the bar on productivity and performance in applied markets. It was nice to learn that our new ion chromatography portfolio was recognized at the show as the Instrument of the Year by readers of SelectScience magazine. This was a great endorsement by our customers and speaks to the strength of this business.", "I'll make one more comment on innovation, because it's a great example of how we innovate to fulfill our mission, which is to enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer. We all know about the Zika virus, because it's been in the news a lot lately. As you'd expect, when Zika first broke out, we quickly mobilized our teams to begin working with government labs in Brazil, as well as the CDC in the U.S. Our Life Science Solutions business has been developing a qPCR-based test to detect the virus, which is currently undergoing a validation process. We're also offering an immunoassay in the U.S. for research use in partnership with the diagnostics company EUROIMMUN, and we've already begun selling this through our channel business. This is a good example of how we're seen by our customers as a thought leader who can help them solve these pressing issues.", "In terms of emerging markets, our second growth driver, let me first say that we saw good growth across all our key geographies in Q1, with strong performance in North America and Europe, as well as very strong performance in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets. The standout contributors were China and India, and I'll give you a little more color on what we saw in those regions during the quarter.", "Starting with India, our commercial teams there are doing an outstanding job of capturing growth opportunities in biopharma, healthcare, and food safety markets. In China, we performed very well in Q1. Our key focus markets, biopharma, healthcare, and environmental, remain robust. As you know, the new five-year plan was announced in March. And much of it is a continuation of the goals set forth in the previous plan, which is great for Thermo Fisher. The plan outlines investments in innovation, healthcare, and the environment. And given the industry-leading presence we've built in China, we continue to be well-positioned in this important growth market.", "In terms of our customer value proposition, the third element of our growth strategy, you could think of our approach here in two parts. First, we continue to enhance our offering for our customers to make our value proposition even stronger. And, second, we're focused on strengthening our commercial capabilities to best leverage our scale and depth of capabilities. Let me give you an example of each from the quarter.", "We enhanced our customer offering by completing our acquisition of Affymetrix at the end of March for $1.3 billion. It was great to be out with the team in Santa Clara for the day one activities, and we're excited about the opportunities we have to leverage our complementary offerings. To remind you, Affymetrix is now part of our Life Science Solutions segment. The business has a strong position in flow cytometry and antibodies, which will strengthen our biosciences offering. Its innovative microarray technologies will also open up new growth avenues for us in genetic sciences, particularly in reproductive health and ag bio. This transaction also offers attractive financial benefits. We expect to generate $70 million of operating income synergies by year three following the close: $55 million from cost and $15 million from revenue. So good financial returns, and a hand-in-glove fit with our Life Science Solutions business.", "The next example I want to share is the investment we've made in our ecommerce capabilities to help our customers take full advantage of our comprehensive portfolio. As I've mentioned in the past, when we acquire a business, we always look to adopt best practices that will make our company even stronger. When we acquired Life Technologies, we gained a gold standard ecommerce platform. We've since moved our Thermo Scientific products to that platform. Now our customers can go to one website for our entire self-manufactured offering, which features rich scientific content, and we'll continue to enhance it with added ecommerce functionality over time. The new website complements our FisherSci.com website, where customers can order our products, as well as those from third-party suppliers. We think of our web presence at a highly valuable tool for driving incremental revenue, and we're pleased with our progress to date.", "Before I cover our guidance, I'll make a quick comment on capital deployment. As you know, we have an excellent track record of creating shareholder value through our capital deployment strategy, and it's been an active first quarter. We mentioned on our last call that we had already bought back $500 million of shares in January. As you saw in our press release, we bought back an additional $500 million of shares later in the quarter as well. So including our stock buybacks, the dividend, and strategic M&A, we've deployed $2.4 billion of capital so far this year.", "Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. Stephen will get into the details, but at a high level, the increased guidance is driven by four factors: the completion of the Affymetrix acquisition in late March, a less adverse foreign exchange environment, the additional $500 million of stock buybacks, and stronger operational performance by our team. Based on these factors, we're raising our revenue guidance for the year to a new range of $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion. This would result in 5% to 6% growth over 2015. We're also raising our adjusted EPS guidance to a new range of $8.05 to $8.19 for strong growth of 9% to 11% year over year.", "Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. We started the year with excellent top and bottom line performance. We closed the acquisition of Affymetrix, and we're excited about the new capabilities it brings. We're performing very well in all key geographies and have many opportunities across our businesses to gain share. All of this positions us to achieve another strong year.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to Stephen.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with an overview of our first quarter financial performance for the total company, then I'll provide some color on the four segments and conclude with our updated 2016 guidance.", "So starting with the overall financial performance for Q1. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 10% to $1.80. GAAP EPS was $1.01, up 5% from Q1 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 10% year over year. The Q1 reported revenue includes 10% organic growth, 1% growth from acquisitions, and a 2% headwind from foreign exchange. Please note, the components of the Q1 change do not sum due to rounding.", "As I mentioned on the last earnings call, the way our fiscal calendar falls in 2016, we have four extra billing days in Q1, and four less in Q4. We estimate that we received just under a 5% benefit to our organic growth in Q1 from the impact of days, the consumables revenue getting most of the impact of the extra days, while the capital equipment revenue was only marginally affected. We expect to see the opposite effect on revenue in Q4, when we have four less billing days, but there's no impact on the year as a whole. So normalizing Q1, minus the extra days, we estimate that our organic growth was approximately 5% during the quarter.", "Looking at growth by geography in Q1, I'll provide some color based on the 5% normalized organic growth to provide you with an understanding of the relative performance by region. Based on that, North America and Europe grew in the mid-single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the high single digits with another strong contribution from China, and rest of the world, which represents less than 5% of our revenues, declined in the high single digits.", "Looking at our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 9%, and adjusted operating margin was 21.7%, down 20 basis points from Q1 of last year. Our margin performance in Q1 was in line with our expectations. We received good expansion from our organic growth, driven by strong contributions from our PPI business system and the benefit of acquisition cost synergies, but this is more than offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from the extra calendar days and a 30 basis point headwind from foreign exchange.", "The impact of the extra days on margins is not that intuitive, so I thought it would be helpful to take a minute to summarize it for you. There were 66 billing days in Q1 2016 versus 62 in Q1 2015, a 6.5% increase. As I mentioned earlier, this had a positive impact on organic growth of approximately 5%. However, since the level of cost is directly correlated to the number of days, the impact on costs was the full 6.5%. So that means our costs went up more than our revenue because of the days impact. The net effect on this, on our operating margin, is the headwind of approximately 30 basis points in Q1 that I just mentioned. It's important to note there'll be a corresponding positive impact to margins in Q4 when we have four less billing days.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.2% in Q1, down 110 basis points from the prior year. The decrease in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to headwinds from unfavorable business mix, the impact of four extra days, and foreign exchange. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.4% of revenue, which is 80 basis points favorable to Q1 2015, and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q1 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.4%.", "Looking at results below the line, net interest expense was $95 million, down $6 million from Q1 last year, mainly as a result of lower average debt levels. Adjusted other income and expense was negative $1 million, which is $8 million lower than 2015, driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14%, flat to last year, and average diluted shares were $398.7 million, down $2.7 million year over year, mainly as a result of the share buybacks completed in Q1, partially offset by option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $290 million, and free cash flow was $180 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $110 million. Free cash flow was $195 million favorable to Q1 2015. We ended the quarter with $830 million in cash and investments, and we also returned significant capital to shareholders during the quarter. On our Q4 call, I mentioned we'd already completed the $500 million in share buybacks in January. We also bought an incremental $500 million later in the quarter for a total of $1 billion in buybacks during Q1. As I'm sure you're all aware, we deployed $1.3 billion to acquire Affymetrix right at the end of Q1. And we also returned $60 million to shareholders during the quarter through our dividend. So all in all, as Marc mentioned, we deployed $2.4 billion of capital in Q1.", "Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $15 billion, up $2.5 billion sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to the acquisition of Affymetrix and the share buyback. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.5 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA. And wrapping up my comments on total company performance, ROIC improved in the quarter. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 9.6%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4.", "So with that, I'll provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. As I highlighted for the total company, foreign exchange continued to be a headwind for the top line for our segments and impacted their year-over-year revenue growth and adjusted operating margin to varying degrees. The four extra calendar days impacted segment revenue and margins to varying degrees as well.", "So starting with Life Science Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 11% in Q1, and organic revenue also grew 11%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth in our bioproduction, biosciences, and next-gen sequencing businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Science Solutions increase 10%, and adjusted operating margin was 29.1%, down 20 basis points year over year. Operating margin was positively affected by volume pull-through, strong productivity, and the impact of days. But this was more than offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and unfavorable foreign exchange.", "In the Analytical Instrument segment, reported revenue increased 4% in Q1, and organic revenue growth was 6%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and services businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in some of our core industrial markets. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments decreased 8%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.7%, down 200 basis points year over year. Strong productivity was more than offset by the impact of the extra days in the quarter, as well as the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange and strategic investments. The days impact was very material for this segment, approximately 200 basis points. Given the low consumables mix in the segment, the extra days had little impact on the top line, but they had the full impact on the cost base, causing significant margin compression. This will reverse in Q4, when we have four less days.", "Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q1, total revenue grew 9%, and organic revenue growth was 10%. This was driven by solid growth across all our businesses in this segment. Adjusted operating income increased 7% in Q1, and adjusted operating margin was 26.9%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Operating margin was positively impacted by good productivity and volume pull-through, but this was more than offset by strategic investments, unfavorable business mix and unfavorable foreign exchange.", "Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 14%, and organic revenue growth was also 14%. This segment continues to benefit from our strong performance in the pharma and biotech end market, with our biopharma services, research and safety market channel and Lab Products businesses all delivering very strong growth. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 16%, and adjusted operating margin was 15%, up 30 basis points from the prior year. Margin expansion in the quarter was driven by volume pull-through and good productivity, with partial offsets from strategic investments and the headwind of the additional days in the quarter.", "We'll now review the details of our full-year 2016 guidance. As you saw in the press release, I'm pleased to report significant increases in both our top and bottom line guidance. The improved guidance is due to several factors: the acquisition of Affymetrix, more favorable foreign exchange rates relative to our prior guidance, additional stock buybacks completed in Q1, and stronger operational performance. I'll take you through the impact of each of these four items in turn.", "The first change related to guidance reflects the acquisition of Affymetrix. We expect this to deliver $275 million of revenue and $40 million of adjusted operating income over the remaining nine months of the year, and that includes our synergies. So in all, that will translate to $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share in 2016. The accretion impact of Affymetrix is very back-end loaded, given the phasing of their revenue and the strong ramp of synergies towards the end of the year. Affymetrix is dilutive to the total-company operating margin in 2016 by approximately 10 basis points.", "The second change to guidance relates to foreign exchange. We've increased our guidance to reflect a less adverse FX environment, increasing revenue by $200 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.11. As you know, we've seen tremendous amount of volatility in FX rates this year, so we used an average of rates over the past couple of months for our revised guidance. Our revised 2016 guidance now assumes a year-over-year FX headwind of $90 million of revenue, $32 million of adjusted operating income, and $0.075 of adjusted earnings per share. So still a headwind for the year, but much lower than our initial guidance.", "The third change to guidance reflects the impact of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. In total, we bought back $1 billion of stock in Q1. Half of this was already in our initial guidance, so the revised guidance includes an additional $0.06 for the second $500 million of buybacks we completed in the quarter.", "The fourth change to guidance reflects improved operational performance. Given the strong start to the year, we're raising the low end of revenue guidance by $25 million and raising the low end of adjusted EPS guidance by $0.02.", "So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance range is $17.86 billion to $18.04 billion, which would represent 5% to 6% growth versus 2015. The $490 million increase to the midpoint comes from three factors: $275 million related to Affymetrix, $200 million from an improved foreign exchange environment, and $15 million of higher organic growth. We're still expecting to deliver organic growth of about 4% for the full year, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of phasing for the remainder of the year, given the days impact and the strong comp from last year, we expect Q4 organic growth to be essentially flat. And, as a reminder, the organic growth comp in Q2 is more challenging than the organic growth comp in Q3. Acquisitions are now expected to contribute about 2% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be a 0.5% headwind.", "In terms of our adjusted EPS, our revised guidance range is $8.05 to $8.19 and represents growth of 9% to 11% over our 2015 adjusted earnings per share of $7.39, with a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. To bridge the $0.24 increase in the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance, we gain $0.11 from the more favorable foreign exchange, $0.06 from Affymetrix, $0.06 from the additional Q1 share buyback, and $0.01 from operational improvements.", "A few other details behind the revised 2016 guidance. We are now expecting 50 to 70 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year over year, and this includes the 10 basis points dilution from Affymetrix. We're expecting net interest expense to be about $390 million versus the $380 million in our previous guidance as a result of the incremental debt relating to the Affymetrix acquisition.", "We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be about 14%, consistent with our previous guidance. In terms of capital deployment, we're still assuming we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures, or stock buybacks. This is consistent with our past practice of not forecasting incremental capital deployments beyond dividends.", "Full-year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of $398 million to $399 million, down about $3 million from our previous guidance as a result of the stock buybacks we completed in Q1. And we're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, up slightly from the previous guidance, due to the Affymetrix acquisition.", "In terms of free cash flow for 2016, we now expect this to be about $2.72 billion, slightly higher than the prior guidance, due to the increase in our earnings outlook related to FX and our operational performance. There is no net free cash flow impact in 2016 from adding Affymetrix, as the operating cash flow for the nine months is offset by the cost of achieved synergies, deal fees, and the capital expenditures related to the business.", "In Q1, we used short-term borrowing for the acquisition of Affymetrix and the stock buybacks. Absent any other need, our intent is to pay this down during the course of the year with the cash flow we generate from operations. As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out.", "So in summary we had a number of significant achievements this quarter while delivering solid operational results, which positions us really well to achieve our financial goals for the year. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Stephen. Jessa, we're ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Good morning, guys. Thanks for all the helpful color. I guess, Marc, as we think about the end markets, where do you feel like you guys are sort of over-punching in terms of gaining share, more so? Because it looks like when we line up your growth rates versus your peer group \u2013 and obviously that's hard \u2013 it does feel on a like-for-like basis, you moved from growing in line-ish to now above the comp group. And so just help us feel for where \u2013 what market, specifically, you feel like maybe you're sort of outperforming?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Ross, good morning, thanks for the question. You know, when I look at the lens from an end market, I'd say pharma and biotech continues to be a huge strength for the company. As you know, we have a very strong competitive position because of our scale and our unique depth of capabilities. We have great relations with all of our pharma and biotech customers, and that's positioned us to do well. That end market was stronger than our expectations in the quarter also, so we were able to deliver very positive growth there. So that's an end market look.", "If you take another lens on the same question, which is more of a product look or a business segment look, it's an area we pay a lot of attention to. Very strong start to the year. And all my comments on this is really normalizing for the days as well so that you're getting a kind of apples-to-apples look. You know, our Lab Products business and our channel business, very strong performance. Certainly our bioproduction business not only benefits from a really good end market, but the business is performing extraordinarily well. So that clearly has been above-market growth.", "Our chromatography and mass spec business, that combined business, had a very strong start to the year as well. So those would be some examples where you take a product lens looking at that and say, how are we doing? That's a nice cut on products, and by the end markets, pharma, biotech, and finally China. Geographically, we're growing very, very strong, continuing the strength there.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "And maybe just following up on that. It feels like the emerging markets, you guys have done a tremendous job. China is continuing on its trajectory, and India, I think, as well has had reasonable demand. Can you just give us a picture? Seemed like that is certainly better than rest of world. What's your thought on how the various high-growth markets kind of pace throughout the rest of the year?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, when I think about the high-level comments there, China has been, for a number of years, our strongest growing market for the company of any significant market, and we continue to be very positive on the outlook for not only the short term, but for the mid- and long-term as well. India is performing well. Reasonable performance in Southeast Asia and Korea. Obviously, real pockets of weakness in Brazil and Russia, and those are very small markets for us. In aggregate, together, I think the two of them represent about 1% of our revenue, so it's not material. So it's always a portfolio. The good news is that the big ones are doing well and the ones that are very small have weakness. And you take a long-term view, those markets too will turn better, but certainly not a 2016 factor.", "Thank you, Ross.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to start and ask about the Lab Products and Services. Even adjusting for the days in the quarter it continues to do a lot better than we would think. Can you maybe just talk about the channel? You mentioned some of the new ecommerce capabilities. Do you think you're taking a little bit more share? Are there any changes in pricing? What are you seeing there?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jack, thanks for the question and good morning. In terms of Lab Products and Services business, you look back over the last number of quarters, we've delivered very strong growth. And that's been a blend of first, our biopharma services business, or our clinical trials and outsourcing business, where we don't really have much in the way of external competition. You have \u2013 the customer choice is primarily do you do it in house or do you outsource to us. And that business has performed very well for a long period of time, and that trend continued again in the first quarter.", "The channel business also has been doing well, really benefiting from strong demand in the biotech and pharmaceutical customer base. So that business has been a strong performer, and our self-manufacturing business within that segment, Lab Products, also did very well, where we're the largest provider of lab consumables and lap equipment in the world. That also is benefiting from strong biotech and pharmaceutical end markets.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And then just one on academic to follow up. Just curious whether you're starting to see anything through the NIH just yet, and maybe just your visibility? I think the growth in the quarter, you mentioned, was a little bit below company average. For the full year, do you still think it's more in line? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jack, in terms of academic and government, what we're seeing there has been consistent with the last few quarters. Adjusted for \u2013 normalizing for days, it would be low single-digit growth. If you don't normalize for days, it would just be under the company average. We continue to be encouraged by the more favorable environment in the U.S., right? So U.S. improved in Q1, so you're starting to see the release of NIH funds, and that should continue in Q2 and Q3. So that's really been a positive, and it should be a reasonable end market from our perspective.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik De Bruin from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Marc, we got a lot of questions on the tax rate, just obviously, given some of the things that were going on with the Pfizer-Allergan deal, and some of the things coming out of Washington. And I know the low tax rate of the company has always been one of the things that people have always asked questions about Thermo. So can you walk us through does the changes that are going on have any impact in the company, number one? And then, how sustainable is the 14% tax rate? And how should we think about that over the next few years? Thanks.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, good morning, Derik; I'll take the question. So obviously we pay very close attention to the tax regulations and changes there, and there's regulations across the world as well as domestically, and we have a great tax team. Recently, the Treasury Department laid out kind of two new tax regulations. One set of regulations is very concentrated to reduce the impact, the benefit of inversions. And those just simply don't apply to the company. The second set of regulations were targeted at limiting U.S. companies' ability to tax-efficiently repatriate cash from overseas.", "And when I think about that impact on our company, our existing tax structures, which aren't impacted by these regulations, provide pretty substantial cash repatriation capacity in a very tax-efficient way. So, at this point, I don't see any material impact from the regulatory changes on the company for the foreseeable future. So bottom line is we're comfortable with the tax rate and the corporate tax planning strategies that we have in place across the company.", "When I think about the tax rate going forward, we'll probably talk more about this at the Analyst Day. Just to remind you, the messaging form last year is the tax rate \u2013 the earnings that accrete going forward over and above the earnings we have today generally come in at a higher marginal tax rate than the 14% that we have in place on average for the company. So, absent any other changes in terms of our structuring, the tax rate will creep up slightly. We've done a pretty good job of making sure that that doesn't happen over time. If you look back over the past three years, I think we've effectively navigated through that. Part of that comes from some structures that we can put in place with acquisitions that we do. But the rest of it really comes from just good management of our tax strategies and just thinking about the different regulatory changes.", "So more to come at the Analyst Day, but that's kind of a recap on how we've seen it for the last couple of years.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, that was very thorough. Thanks for the overview. I'll get back in the queue.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Derik.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. First question was on just a little bit more geographic color. I think you gave us a general sense of how things played out globally, but was curious if you could offer a growth rate in China and in Europe.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, so in terms of the growth rates, you had strong double-digit growth in China, and when you adjust that for the days, it's going to be in the teens. When you look at Europe, it grew pretty much in line with the company average in terms of growth. So it was a good, good, solid quarter in Europe as well.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, maybe Stephen, a follow-up on margins. Appreciate all your comments regarding the puts and takes in the first quarter, and some of the corresponding benefits in the fourth quarter. But if we kind of look away from that, I was wondering if you could comment a little bit on just PPI. I know that's an ongoing focus for the company every year, and I was wondering if you could talk to a little bit about what the key initiatives are this year. And just looking for some color on the underlying efforts you guys are making to improve margins. Thank you.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure, so yeah, think about the PPI drivers of productivity. It's a group of levers that we use and have continually used since I've been at the company. And it's kind of a combination of \u2013 larger type of restructurings where you're consolidating the footprints of the organization in terms of the manufacturing operations and the back office. It's also the micro aspect of PPI. So we're \u2013 day in, day out, we're just being better at leaning out the operations and the back office functions and kind of the way that we work. So the combination of all of that is a continual set of efforts.", "So there's nothing \u2013 no major shift in terms of low-cost region plays that we're doing, the footprint optimization, and the use of sourcing and pricing levers. Those are kind of continuing. But the one new thing this year, as I said on the last earnings call, is that we're looking to reinvest the benefit of the medical device tax into some longer-term projects. And one \u2013 a set of projects around the footprint and more complex footprint changes in terms of manufacturing, and then being more efficient in our financial back office. Those projects are underway and are progressing well. So I think it's just a continuum in terms of the impact of the PPI business system, and then we're kind of stepping it up a little bit in terms of using the opportunity to reinvest the medical device tax.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Maybe just first question on biopharma. I know in your initial guidance, Marc, for the year, I think you'd kind of factored in a 600 basis point, 700 basis point headwind just from the tough comp. Maybe just \u2013 can you think about what you think the growth trajectory looks like for that segment for the rest of the year? And are there kind of larger strategic deals out there that you're looking at as well in the biopharma business, particularly around bioprocess and bioproduction?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Tycho, thank you for the question. In terms of the end market, we had our easiest comparison in the first quarter. So we had a very strong start, better than we expected. As you look at the outlook for the rest of the year, we expect that the growth will continue to still be very strong, but a little bit less robust rate than what we saw in the first quarter, in terms of the biopharma end market. But it'll be our fastest-growing market for the year; that's our expectation.", "In terms of strategic M&A, we have a really good M&A pipeline. Bolt-ons primarily, but we consider many different transactions, and if the right ones line up, you'll see us be active. So that's kind of the normal course for us. We're always thinking about and taking actions to strengthen the company's competitive position.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then in Stephen's comments by division, he mentioned strategic investments for each of the different segments. Can you maybe just talk from a higher level where you're placing more incremental investment this year?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So it's the usual areas around improving our commercial capabilities in some specific areas, particularly around service infrastructure, as well as some specific R&D new products introduction and product launch-type of investments. So it's \u2013 the growth areas for the top line are what we're focused on.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Tycho.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg from UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks, good morning, and congratulations on a solid start to the year. So, Marc, I guess \u2013 you've answered a lot of end market questions, so I'm going to steer away from some of those. I think we get the sense as to what's changed the EPS and the impact from some of what you're seeing operationally. So I want to focus on maybe two quick things. One, on Affymetrix, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you're \u2013 a little bit more about how you're thinking of integrating that asset, and what could drive upside to the accretion that you've talked about? I know you distribute some products from Affymetrix. To me, it's always looked a little bit more like a product line. Seemed like there could be a lot of G&A overlap. So can you maybe just talk a little bit about what might drive upside to your accretion targets?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. So, Jon, we're really excited to have the business as part of Thermo Fisher and have welcomed our new colleagues. And they're not only running the business well but actively looking at how do you maximize the impact with our customer base and the competitive position?", "I'd break it into two different themes. One is a product theme, and one is a geographic theme. The geographic theme is quite easy, right? Where we'll be looking for upside is really the commercial reach around the world. Thermo Fisher has incredible reach, and Affymetrix was a much narrower company, so that will help over time, focusing on accelerating growth and capturing revenue synergies. And over time, we'll obviously drive to the upside to the most extent possible.", "From a product fit, the reason the acquisition is so compelling is really the way you framed it. Which is, it was a whole company, but really it is two great product lines that fit so incredibly tightly with our Life Science Solutions business, and we're able to combine our flow cytometry and antibody businesses and the biosciences business, which gives us a much stronger competitive position. And we're able to add the micro-array technologies to our large genetic sciences business, which really puts us in a very unique position, because we will be truly technology agnostic for solving customers' problems, because we will be the only company that has next-gen sequencing, Sanger sequencing, microarrays, and qPCR with leading positions across that array of technology. So that a customer will say, here's the challenge I have, and we will give them the optimal work flow. And these are very complementary fits.", "So with good execution we'll obviously focus on delivering what we committed to, and then always looking for the upside. So \u2013 from an accretion perspective, as we announced when we announced the deal in January, we see the $0.10 in the first full year, which translates to basically $0.06 this year, $0.04 in Q1 of 2017. But, as you know, as time unfolds we'll be looking for opportunities to drive to the upside. That's probably more of a 2017 benefit than a 2016 benefit.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. That's really helpful. And then just a quick follow-up. I've gone back over your comments, Marc, maybe over the last couple years. Two categories you consistently call out have been, in terms of growth, have been chromatography and actually also NGS. You're a huge company, so I'm guessing if you're calling those out, they must be particularly strong growers. Would you be willing to kind of size those businesses for us today, kind of relatively, how big they are?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The specifics doesn't matter as much, but the next-gen sequencing business is approximately a couple percent of revenue. And the chromatography business, kind of order of magnitude, just shy of $1 billion, it's a little under that. So NGS is a small business growing rapidly. Chromatography is a pretty-good sized business growing rapidly. And that really, to me, I like the chromatography business, because what you saw was Thermo Fisher, years ago, having a strong niche position, Dionex having a strong niche position. The combination is a very strong business, and the two businesses together are growing faster than what the individual businesses were growing as standalones. So that's the kinds of capabilities that Thermo Fisher Scientific brings when we combine businesses because of the very strong advantages we have from scale and depth of capabilities.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I really wanted to just try to cover two topics. One is Specialty Diagnostics; the other is innovation. So, starting on Specialty Diagnostics. This has been an area where you guys have underperformed relative to the corporate average and I think everybody's expectations, including yours, for several quarters. This quarter you did really, really well. Can you help us think about how we should think about the underlying growth rate of Specialty Diagnostics moving ahead? And are there some investments being made in Specialty Diagnostics that are driving better performance?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, in terms of Specialty Diagnostics, we are investing very significantly in areas that will create a brighter future for the growth rates in that business, right? And they don't have a big short-term impact. Very large programs in the next-gen sequencing area. Very large programs in mass spectrometry. Obviously they're driving some level of growth, but they really are positioning for the long term, right? So that's one thing, which is why, when we take a long-term perspective on the business, we're very, very bullish and optimistic about the long-term growth prospects there.", "In terms of the performance of the business in the quarter, a better quarter strength across really all of the businesses within the portfolio. The seasonal businesses really were no effect one way or the other, so there was no special causes. And we didn't have to talk about OEM contract and all that other stuff that was \u2013 again, had a lot of talk, but in the scheme of things wasn't that material. So it was a reasonable quarter, and really we're taking the actions to make sure that in the long term that business is a good, fast-growing business for us.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, Doug, I don't want to take any shine off a good quarter, but just to remind you that the organic growth that I gave in my script around the segments were the reported organic growth and not the days adjusted. Days adjusted is still good in that segment, so it's about the company average. So I'd just try and remind everybody that those percentages I gave out are non-days adjusted for the segments.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Got it. All right, that's all very helpful. And I guess on the innovation topic, and some of this ties into what you described in terms of your longer-term investments or your investments in longer-term opportunities within Specialty Diagnostics, Marc. In reading your proxy, I won't read the exact language, but you noted that the percentage of 2015 revenue attributable from products commercialized in the last two years was down relative to what you saw in 2014. And relatedly you had appointed a new CSO. Can you provide a bit more detail on what changes you're making to improve this metric over the next few years? And does the strength you're seeing early in the year afford you an opportunity to maybe invest more pursuant to improving this metric? Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Doug, that's a great question. So one of the things in the metric, which is kind of fun, which is we use a very short window on momentum. So the metric was down slightly year over year, and that's primarily because the Orbitrap, one of the Orbitrap derivatives that had unbelievable success, which still has that same great momentum, came off the two-year anniversary, so they don't consider it a new product, right? So you have the ebbs and flows on the metric. When I look at the dollars of products that we're deriving from \u2013 dollars of revenue \u2013 that number's been pretty solid for the company.", "The actions we're taking to create an even brighter future from innovation, we have a great Chief Scientific Officer and a very strong team, and you'll get that \u2013 a little bit of a highlight of some of the things we're working on at the analyst meeting in less than a month's time. So reserve the date. I'm sure Ken has sent that out. It's the best day in New York of the year, as I know \u2013 at least from my perspective. And so you'll get a sense of it, but we're very confident about the investments we're making. And in fact, two weeks ago, I was out with 300 of our leading scientists at the company, at a symposium we were doing, where they were actually working on new business ideas and new technology ideas, leveraging the strengths of the company. And I came away just so unbelievably energized by some of the things our teams are working on. We have incredible talent within R&D. So (53:24).", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "One question on the balance between consumables and instruments. It's a little difficult, given the relative impact of the selling days issued here in the quarter, to look at on an organic basis how consumables are tracking relative to instruments. Maybe not necessarily for the quarter, but on a trailing two- or three-quarter basis. Could you give us a sense for how consumables are tracking relative to instruments? And historically, as cycles have strengthened, you might have seen a few more points of strength early on in instruments. Is that happening here? And if we see more consumable strength going forward, what does that mean on a relative basis for the potential for margin expansion?", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So I'll start. When I think about the instruments business, and you look at it, very little revenue effect from days. About 6% organic growth in the quarter, in terms of how the instruments business did. Which, when you peel that back, you have a large chemical analysis business serving some very weak sectors of the industrial market, and then a very large chromatography and mass-spectrometry business. So, when you think of that level of growth, it's very strong performance, and that's been like, that bifurcation of weak industrial, weak chemical analysis, very strong life sciences, mass spec, and chromatography, has been a continuation trend. So that business is good.", "From the consumables mix \u2013 and pretty steady on good performance, right? Our channel business has done well; Life Science Solutions has done well. When I think about profitability, it's not a huge driver. We make a little bit more money on consumables for the self-manufactured portion, but embedded in there is the channel business. So, as you know, we don't manage the mix that way, but generally I'm not concerned by sort of the rates of growth in the businesses. In fact, the consumable growth shows that we have pretty steady, stable performance in the end markets.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then just one clarification. Can you remind us in the outlook for the year, to what extent you've incorporated expectations for stronger trends on the NIH in the back half, given the normal 3Q disbursements that one would expect? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, so we pretty much expected the funds to flow from NIH in the first three quarters. And as you alluded, probably the strongest in Q3. But it should be reasonable in each of those three quarters during the course of this year.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Please go ahead.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. Just one question for Stephen. In terms of the free cash flow, could you help us bridge the gap between the 25% conversion we saw in the first quarter and sort of if there was discrete dynamics weighing on that in the first period? And how we get really from there to what seems to imply about 85% conversion for the full year?", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So it's a dynamic we see pretty much every year. It's very front-end loaded in terms of interest and cash tax payments, as well as we pay bonus \u2013 bonus payouts come out in the first quarter. And then, generally, there's a depletion of working capital, an increase in working capital. And there's a decrease at the end of the year, an increase at the beginning of the year. So it's a pretty similar seasonal dynamic that we've seen play out for the past many, many years. So actually I feel good that we're ahead significantly from last year. We're almost $200 million higher, free cash flow than this point back in Q1 2015.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, that's it. Thanks.", "Stephen Williamson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Jessa, we have time for one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning, thank you. Maybe just a question on pharma from the services side. Can you just talk to growth for Unity in the quarter? And then maybe as a follow-on, Marc, each of the big players there has been doing well for some time now. Just curious how you would characterize the competition these days? Are you bumping into those guys more than in the past? Or is everybody operating in their own sweet spot, so to speak? I think you get the competitive dynamic question pretty often there, but just curious about the runway there as we try to get our hands around the continuation in biopharma strength. Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. So in terms of the services portion of the company. About 14% of our revenue is services, and that's split between our biopharma services or our clinical trial services business and the Unity Lab Services, which is basically a combination of supporting our instruments and equipment and doing some outsourcing of that for our customers as well. Both of those businesses have demonstrated good growth, and growing at or above the company average in terms of performance. And the competitive set on the Unity Lab Services side really hasn't changed much. You have a couple other companies that are in that market. And each have their own strategy. We feel good about our outlook there.", "Marc N. Casper - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "So, let me wrap it up here. Thank you for the interest, and from my perspective, we had a great start to the year, with a great Q1 behind us. We're very well-positioned to deliver a strong 2016. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter and of course, seeing you in New York City in May at our Analyst Day.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. . Thank you.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice-President Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin your call.", ".", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on our website thermofisher.com under the heading Webcasts and Presentations until November 11, 2016. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations is available on the investor section of our web site under the heading Financial Results. So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our safe harbor statement", "Various remarks that we may make about the company's future expectations, plans, and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors including those discussed in the company's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended July 2, 2016, under the caption Risk Factors, which is on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission and also available on the investor section of our website under the heading SEC filings. While we may elect to update forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so even if our estimates change; therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as representing our views as of any date subsequent to today.", "Also during this call we'll be referring to certain financial measures not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2016 earnings and future expectations and also in the investor section of our website under the heading financial information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 earnings call. We're pleased to tell you that we had another great quarter and we're right where we should be at this point of the year. We delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom lines. We continued to execute our growth strategy to best serve our customers and gain share. And we also completed our acquisition of FEI earlier than we expected, and the integration process is in full swing. So terrific progress across the board. I'll cover these points in more details in a few moments.", "But the key message is that with three great quarters behind us, we're well positioned to deliver another very successful year. I'll start by covering the Q3 financials at a high level, give you some color on our performance by end market, and provide a recap of the quarterly highlights in the context of our growth strategy. Then I'll wrap up with our revised guidance.", "In terms of financials, revenue in Q3 grew 9% to $4.49 billion. Adjusted operating income was up 11% and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 40 basis points to 23%. Finally, I'm very pleased that we achieved a 13% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.03. As you know, adjusted EPS is our primary performance metric and we continue to deliver consistently strong results to extend our long track record here.", "In summary, it was a great quarter financially and our teams are really executing well to take advantage of the opportunities we have to help our customers meet their goals. As you hear from us every quarter, we're committed to building on our capabilities to being an even stronger partner for them whether we're launching new products or making strategic acquisitions. The global environment obviously has its challenges, but we look at them as opportunities to help our customers be successful, and we're effectively leveraging our unique value proposition to gain share and drive growth. That's a good segue into our end market discussion.", "There's been a lot of commentary on the various end market dynamics. Let me provide some color on what we saw on the four end markets in Q3. In aggregate, our key end markets were in line with our expectations, and Q3 was similar to what we saw in Q2. At a high level, two of our end markets were essentially the same: academic and government and health care and diagnostics. And the other two changed a little. Pharma and biotech was a bit stronger, and industrial and applied was a bit weaker. I'll give you a few more details about each one.", "In pharma and biotech, we grew in the low-double digits in Q3. The market dynamics remained very healthy and we continued to effectively leverage our depth of capabilities to gain share with these customers. Growth in our bioproduction and biopharma services businesses were particularly strong in the quarter, and we also had strong performance here in our chromatography and mass spec business.", "Academic and government end markets grew slightly in the quarter, and industrial and applied end markets declined slightly. And in health care and diagnostics, our growth overall was similar to last quarter. This was highlighted by strong performance in our transplant diagnostic business and particularly strong growth in our clinical next-gen sequencing business. So, again, not much difference in our end markets overall compared with Q2.", "Now, I'll cover some of our Q3 business highlights in the context of our growth strategy. As you know, we continue to follow a clear and consistent strategy to strengthen our position in targeted end markets and geographic regions. We're focused on developing high impact innovative new products, expanding our scale in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, and enhancing our unique customer value proposition.", "I'll start with innovation as I usually do. We launched a number of new products during the quarter across our businesses, but I'd like to focus my remarks today on a few examples of how we're increasing our depth of capabilities for customers working in the clinic. Late July marked the annual meeting of the American Association of Clinical Chemistry. We showcased a number of assays, instruments and software under our Thermo Scientific Premier brand. So let me highlight a few of them.", "First, we were pleased to be cleared by the U.S. FDA to expand the use of our leading BRAMS PCT sepsis test. It can now be used in the emergency room or other medical wards before a patient is admitted to the ICU. Our PCT test was previously cleared only for the use with critically ill patients on their first day in the ICU. By administering the sepsis test much earlier, clinicians can protect a broader patient population and help to reduce the associated health care costs.", "We also worked in tandem with our key PCT license partners, Roche Diagnostics and bioM\u00e9rieux,", "so that they could receive clearance to run the test on their extensive installed base of instruments in the U.S. This will significantly expand access to this valuable diagnostic tool. We also received clearance for several other diagnostic assays as well. One was the DRI Hydrocodone Assay, which has a high level of sensitivity to help doctors quickly identify possible opioid abuse. We also received clearance for two new EliA IgG autoimmunity tests for more effective diagnosis of thyroid disease.", "Last, for greater accuracy in the clinical lab, we launched LabLink xL 2.0 software so clinicians can compare and validate results in real time from labs around the world. I also want to make a comment on our next-gen sequencing business as well, where we're seeing nice momentum in customer adoption of our sequencers, including the new S5 and S5 XL that we introduced about a year ago.", "In the quarter, we launched a number of new assays including additions to our Oncomine family of high-value oncology kits. Our new lung cell-free DNA as well as our BRCA1 and 2 assays are all designed for NGS analysis on our Ion Torrent platform. We also launched the new Ion AmpliSeq Transcriptome Human Gene Expression Kit, which enables the simultaneous analysis of more than 20,000 genes in a single assay using our Ion Chef sample prep technology as part of the work flow.", "In terms of highlights from a geographic perspective, we're pleased to deliver another strong quarter of growth in Asia Pacific and emerging markets, which is the second pillar of our growth strategy. Our results in Q3 were led by outstanding performance in China and India. China continues to be a significant contributor, with growth in the high teens during the quarter. We're positioning Thermo Fisher to not only take advantage of the significant opportunities available in China today, but also to help those customers meet their future plans.", "An important aspect of that is understanding the government's longer-term focus. During my last visit there in Q3, I spent time in Guangzhou and had the opportunity to meet with the municipal party secretary. We formalized a strategic partnership that involves working with local companies and scientific institutions in Guangzhou to advance health care, environmental protection and food safety. This is part of a national plan to boost development in the South China region.", "We're also partnering with Health BioMed, a leading provider of clinical diagnostic and pharmaceutical products in China. The goal is to advance the development of molecular diagnostic kits for infectious disease and pharmacogenomic screening. The kits will be based on our Applied Biosystems CE platform and is another great example of our ability to support precision medicine initiatives that are part of China's five-year plan.", "These are just two of the examples from the many that we have in terms of long-term growth in China. I always leave China even more energized about our prospects. It's a large and growing market. Our scale gives us a strong competitive advantage and we're well aligned with the country's strategic priorities.", "I also spent some time in South Korea in Q3, and a specific opportunity I want to highlight there is the demand for our biopharma services capabilities. South Korea is a key location for clinical trials research because of strong government support, its modern infrastructure and an easily accessible patient population. During the quarter, we opened a new state-of-the-art facility in Seoul to provide local and global companies with a comprehensive clinical trial support. This complements our biopharma services capabilities in the region, including those in Singapore, China, India and Japan. South Korea is also a great example of how we're leveraging our unique customer value proposition, which is the third pillar of our growth strategy.", "Korea's GDP is growing in line with many developed countries, but we're clearly gaining share here. That's because of the size of our sales force, our full suite of products and services and the way we effectively bring it all together to help our customers drive innovation and productivity. We have outstanding customer relationships across Korea and are well positioned to continue to gain share.", "As you know, we continue to invest to strengthen our customer value proposition. And the major highlight in Q3 was our acquisition of FEI, which we completed in September. FEI is a well-respected business with a leading position in electron microscopy. We're excited to add these technologies to our analytical instruments offering and extend their reach to our large lifescience customer base.", "I attended the day-one town halls at FEI sites in the Czech Republic and the Netherlands. I was able to meet many of our 3,000 new colleagues, and it was great to see their enthusiasm about joining Thermo Fisher. I've been impressed with the FEI teams and the operations I've visited so far. The Brno site in the Czech Republic in particular is a world-class manufacturing facility that produces a wide range of FEI products. It's also strategically located in an area with a highly-skilled workforce. The ability to leverage this site to support other parts of our company will help us to further optimize our global footprint and increase our presence in lower-cost regions.", "So we're very bullish about the many advantages that FEI brings to Thermo Fisher. The integration teams have hit the ground running and are implementing their plans. We're confident in our ability to achieve the $80 million of total synergies we laid out when we announced the transaction back in May.", "Before I move on to guidance, let me give you a quick overview of where we stand with our capital deployment activities so far this year. With the additions of Affymetrix and FEI, we've deployed more than $5 billion on strategic M&A, $1 billion in stock buybacks and we're on a path to approximately $240 million of returns in dividends in 2016. So it's been an active year for Thermo Fisher Scientific in terms of effectively deploying our capital to create value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Now let me give you a quick update on our guidance for 2016. As you saw in our press release, we're raising our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the year. As usual, Stephen will cover the details and assumptions, but in summary, we're raising guidance based on the addition of FEI, our strong operational performance in the first nine months, and a better foreign exchange environment. We now expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion. This would result in 8% growth over 2015. We're raising our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint to a new range of $8.19 to $8.30, which represents 11% to 12% growth year-over-year.", "Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me sum up my remarks with a couple of takeaways. It was another great quarter in terms of our financial performance, and we extended our long track record of consistently delivering strong adjusted EPS growth. We closed on the acquisition of FEI and look forward to the new opportunities we'll have to create value and drive growth. With the strong nine months behind us we're on track to deliver another very successful year.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of the third quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four segments and conclude with the updated 2016 guidance.", "Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. Operationally, we're right in line with our expectations both on organic growth and earnings generation.", "Given the level of volatility in foreign exchange rates so far this year, it was good to see that Q3 FX was $0.02 less adverse than we previously estimated and finally it was great to get the FEI deal closed in September, and we were able to deliver $0.04 of additional adjusted earnings per share in the quarter. So the high level summary is we had a strong Q3 and we were able to deliver $0.06 of adjusted earnings per share above what we had previously expected.", "Now let me give you some more color on the quarter. Starting with adjusted earnings per share, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 13% to $2.03. GAAP EPS was $1.19 up 1% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 9% year-over-year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, a 5% contribution from acquisitions, and a slight headwind from currency translation. In Q3, we recognized just under $100 million of revenue from FEI.", "Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, this was very similar to what we saw in Q2. Both North America and Europe continued to grow in the low-single digits. Asia Pacific grew in the low teens, with another strong quarter from China, which grow in the high teens, as Marc mentioned, and the rest of the world declined low single digits", "Turning to our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 23.0%, up 40 basis points from Q3 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q3, we delivered solid expansion from our organic growth driven by our PPI business system and volume leverage, and this was partially offset by unfavorable business mix, strategic investments, and a modest headwind from acquisitions. This quarter, FX had no impact on operating margin.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 48.9% in Q3, up 60 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted gross margin expansion was driven by strong productivity, positive contributions from acquisitions and FX, and partially offset by business mix and strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.8% of revenue, which is up 30 basis points versus Q3 2015, and R&D expense came in at 4.1% of revenue, down 10 basis points versus Q3 last year. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in the quarter was 6.1%.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $103 million, which is $10 million higher compared to Q3 last year, mainly as a result of financing relating to our capital deployment actions this year. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 13.1%, which is 90 basis points lower than last year as a result of our tax planning initiatives and the timing of discrete items. However, this was in line with our expectations. Average diluted shares in the quarter were 397.4 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year as a result of the share buybacks we completed in Q1, partially offset by stock option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, for the first nine months, cash flow from continuing operations was $2 billion and free cash flow was $1.7 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. This is approximately $350 million higher than our prior-year cash flow for the same period. We ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash and investments. This is higher than normal due to the timing of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition. $1.2 billion of this was used on the first business day of Q4 to pay down debt obligations.", "Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $18.9 billion, up $4.8 billion sequentially from Q2 as a result of the financing activities related to the FEI acquisition, and leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.2 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA, up from 3.2 times at the end of Q2. After we paid down the debt on the first day of Q4, the leverage ratio was down to 4.0 times. Similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3. And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC continued to be strong. Our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of the quarter was 9.8%.", "So with that, I'll now provide you with some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with the life science solutions segment, reported revenue increased 14% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across a number of the businesses led by next-gen sequencing, bioproduction and biosciences.", "Q3 adjusted operating income in life science solutions increased 11% and adjusted operating margin was 30.1%, a decline of 70 basis points year-over-year. Adjusted operating margin was in line with our expectations and the year-over-year contraction was driven by unfavorable business mix and the impact of acquisitions, partially offset by positive productivity and volume pull-through.", "In the analytical instrument segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 15% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 3%. In the quarter, we had strong growth contributions from our chromatography and mass spec and our environmental instruments businesses, partially offset by continued weakness in the businesses serving our industrial end markets. Q3 adjusted operating income in analytical instruments increased 30% and adjusted operating margin was 21.2% up 240 basis points year-over-year.", "In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, favorable FX, good volume leverage, and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. Expansion from these drivers was partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the impact of strategic investments", "Turning to the specialty diagnostics segment, in Q3 reported and organic revenue both grew 3%. We saw good growth in our transplant diagnostics and immuno-diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 5% in Q3, and adjusted operating margin was 26.8%, up 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was driven by strong productivity, good volume pull-through, and FX tailwinds, partially offset by the impact of strategic investments and headwinds from business mix.", "Finally, in the lab products and services segment, Q3 reported revenue increased 7% and organic growth was 6%. We delivered particularly strong growth in our biopharma services and channel businesses. Adjusted operating income in the segment increased 3%, and adjusted operating margin was 14.8%, down 40 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from volume and productivity; however, these were more than offset by the impact of strategic investments and unfavorable business mix.", "Now I'll review the details of our updated full year 2016 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $400 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11 at the midpoint.", "Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to generate about 4.5% organic growth for the full year of 2016. Of the $400 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $30 million reflects the slightly less adverse FX environment, and $370 million reflects the impact of FEI, which includes approximately $100 million we recognized in Q3. The FEI numbers are net of purchase accounting adjustments to reduce deferred revenue. Then on adjusted earnings per share, we've increased the midpoint of our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.11. This reflects $0.02 from the less adverse FX environment and $0.09 from the impact of FEI, which includes the $0.04 we recognized in Q3.", "And finally, with three quarters of strong operational performance behind us and factoring in the addition of FEI, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $140 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.11.", "So to sum all this up, the revised 2016 revenue guidance is now a range of $18.25 billion to $18.39 billion, which would represent 8% growth versus 2015. We expect acquisitions to contribute about 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2016, and FX is expected to be about a 1% headwind.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2016 guidance is now a range of $8.19 to $8.30 with a midpoint of $8.245. This represents growth of 11% to 12% versus 2015. Excluding the FX impact, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 13%. We are now expecting 50 basis points to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year. This is slightly lower than our previous guidance of 60 basis points to 70 basis points, primarily as a result of the impact of the FEI acquisition.", "There are a few other details behind our 2016 guidance. Given the days impact on our 2016 fiscal calendar, I thought it would be helpful to revisit our prior comments around phasing. Our Q1 had four more days and our Q4 will have four less days that the equivalent quarters in 2015. As a result, we're expecting the reported organic growth in Q4 to be essentially flat and the days adjusted organic growth in Q4 to be about 4.5%, consistent with our previous guidance. This would also result in a full-year organic growth of about 4.5%, also consistent with our previous guidance.", "Net interest expense has increased $25 million from our previous guidance to $420 million as a result of the FEI acquisition. There is no change to our full-year adjusted income tax rate guidance, which is still expected to be about 14%. This implies a 15% adjusted tax rate in Q4, slightly higher than the full-year average due to the phasing earlier in the year of certain discrete tax planning actions. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions, divestitures or share buybacks.", "Full year average diluted shares are estimated to be about 398 million, consistent with previous guidance. We're expecting net capital expenditure to be approximately $440 million, consistent with previous guidance. And finally, we're still expecting about $2.72 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2016, consistent with previous guidance, and forecasting that the operational cash flow generated by FEI during our period of ownership in 2016 will be offset by the related transaction and restructuring costs. As always, when interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out.", "And in summary, we've had three strong quarters of operational performance, a less adverse FX environment than expected and our capital deployment activities are generating strong earnings benefits in 2016 and will enhance our strategic position over the long term. All of this keeps us on track to deliver another excellent year.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Jon Groberg of UBS. Please go ahead.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. And congratulations on another solid quarter. Marc, obviously, there's a lot of concern out there in the investor community around the biopharma market. You noted another strong, almost looked like accelerating, growth in that market. Any comments at all around early indications of what you may be seeing there? Any potential concern around what you're hearing from customers or elections?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Jon, thanks for the question. Been a great end market for us. The outlook continues to be very bright. Let's talk about why the market is generally good. The science is good and the number of approved drugs continues to go well. Vaccines are continuing to play a more and more important role in healthcare, and that's a good positive as well.", "And as more and more biotech, large molecule drugs are making it through the pipeline versus small molecules, biotech is a larger consumer on a relative basis of lifescience tools and diagnostics because it's not just in the research and clinical trials phase, but all the way into production you would use our products. So actually the industry looks very bright.", "And then obviously on top of that is the company's position within the industry. And we have a great value proposition with these customers and we have consistently gained share for a number of years. We have strong relationships across all of the major biotech and pharmaceutical companies. And they see us as their partner to drive innovation and productivity, and that has allowed us to have a great historical performance, but, more importantly, positioned for a very bright outlook in this end market.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. And then a quick follow-up, Marc, on I guess it looks to me like Affymetrix is still a little bit underperforming relative to maybe where you expected or at least what they were doing. And so I'm just curious, as you initially get to know FEIC and, again, given some of the end markets out there, are you feeling comfortable with your initial outlook of FEIC as you've gotten to know it better? Any updated thoughts there? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So in terms of FEI, really we're very excited to have the company as part of Thermo Fisher Scientific and a great addition in terms of colleagues. The business is on track to have a good year in terms of growth, and obviously had a nice contribution in Q3 and a good contribution to our success in Q4. So integration is just getting underway. We did the planning between announcement and close, and the teams are executing well and we're very excited about what FEI is going to bring to the company over time. What we expect over time, as we said back in May, is that this business will grow faster than the company average. Thanks, Jon.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "So, Marc, I know it's a little early to start thinking about 2017 maybe, but you're doing 11% to 12% EPS growth this year, 12% or 13% FX adjusted. At your Analyst Day, you said that, with capital deployment, 12% to 15% EPS growth was how we should think about the Thermo model going forward. Is that still the best way to think about, given the FEI and the Affy deals that are in there, is that a good starting point for next year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Derik, thanks for the question. Obviously, we'll give our guidance in early 2017 on the Q4 call. The way that I see it is you have the base operational assumptions and the capital deployment assumptions. And if I think about the environment, the environment looks very similar to what it was in May. So that puts us in a range of 4% to 6% organic growth in terms of that.", "And in terms of capital deployment, we will clearly benefit from the accretion that we get from FEI on a year-over-year basis, and certainly the accretion that we get from the Affymetrix transaction. So at a high level, the way you articulated it I agree with. You obviously have to work through all the math, but given the strong acquisitions that we've done this year, we're going to get a nice contribution to our earnings from the capital deployment actions in this year.", "Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "And then just one quick follow-up. So was there any signs at all that delayed equipment purchases in the academic labs in both/either the U.S. or Europe?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "The academic end markets, the government end markets, were very similar to what we saw in Q2, with the U.S. growing in the low-single digits and the rest of the world a little bit more muted than that. And we didn't really see any meaningful changes in the trends.", "Derik de Bruin - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.", "Great. Thank you", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Good morning, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "So I want to dig back into pharma. I was hoping you could maybe parse out what your expectations are going forward within the sub-segment by some of the key areas. So we've heard from the pharmas themselves and from the CROs and from the CDMOs sort of varying comments around demand. So can you give us a feel for what you're seeing in sort of base discovery and the tools and equipment that gets sold there versus production, which seems like it's still on fire. And then maybe your biopharma service business, just give us a feel if it's sort of consistent across the three or four key buckets and across the customer bases or if there's maybe one or two areas that you're either more or less constructive on.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "We're doing well, all right. So, I mean, that is the summary. So you can parse it different ways, and the growth is strong no matter how you parse it. Obviously, the bioproduction and the clinical trials logistics, or bio-pharma services businesses, continue to perform very well. And, you know, are growing a little bit above the rates there. But if you just kind of do the math, it implies that the rest is growing very strongly as well. So there wasn't much nuance in terms of the strong performance.", "I would say that our chromo-mass spec business obviously had a good quarter serving that business as well, but that's not implying that something did poorly. But given that there's been a lot of questions about what's going on in capital equipment, it's actually been pretty good. So we feel good about the end market. It's been a good nine months and it's been a good number of years. And we're well positioned.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "And I guess on the industrial side, and applied, is there any geographic bias to the weakness there? We've heard varying comments in sort of Eastern Europe much worse than Western Europe and maybe mix out of Japan, but China good. I'm just curious to see your perspective on that and where, maybe if anywhere, you're seeing any positive signs of stabilization or improvement.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You know, from the industrial and applied markets, they declined very slightly in the quarter. As I read things outside of Thermo Fisher, just what's going on in the broader world, clearly industrial markets are soft globally. You know, it didn't seem like any particular geography really jumped out at us as a particular standout off of that. The applied markets in China continue to be good. So that's obviously positive; things like food safety and environmental protection. So that's a bright spot. But we didn't really get any particular pockets of weakness on the industrial or applied that we saw.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", ".", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Thanks. Marc, I want to go back to the academic markets. Obviously, there's kind of heightened sensitivity and I appreciate your business has been holding up better than others. It does seem like academic went from low single digit growth to slight growth. But can you give us a sense from your perspective on the market on what's going on? I mean, you were very positive at the beginning of the year on NIH dynamics and now we're seeing the outlays drop off about 13% in September.", "Obviously, university endowments are under pressure as well. So I guess what I'm trying to get to is there a risk that you might actually see this in the fourth quarter? If we go back to 3Q 2011 you saw things later than your peers. And what's the risk for bigger ticket items like cryo-em [cryo electron microscopy], which you now have with FEIC?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Tycho, the first thing I'd say I think we're performing incredibly well. I don't think anything other than that. And then in terms of the academic and government markets, if you go back to what we said at the very beginning of the year, right, which is probably the best way to think about what's different or what's the same, we expected that the year would start slower in the U.S. in academic and government and then build as the year went on. And actually the year started a little bit stronger than we had expected and has stayed steady with that that low single digit growth. So it came a little bit early, and it's been very steady.", "In terms of the other geographies, obviously, given that we expected academic and government to be a little bit better in aggregate, it basically says those must be slightly weaker, and clearly that's been offset by the strength in biopharma. So that's the sort of looking back in late January what's changed. In terms of are we off cycle versus others, I don't know. I think we're gaining share versus others. But that's my opinion. And, you know, when we thought about our range of outcomes for the year, we felt comfortable with raising the guidance at the end of Q2 to 4.5% organic growth, and we feel comfortable reaffirming that 4.5% outlook.", "And the way I think about it is our commercial teams cover a range of customers. We focus on where the best opportunities are, and, in a way, we don't force a lot of micro level of analysis for the investment community. It's our job to manage through it and we feel well positioned to deliver a really nice year in terms of performance.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then on FEI, one of the dynamics they had talked about prior to the acquisition was an anticipated recovery in the semi market as you had the shift to 10-nanometer production, can you maybe talk about whether your view on that has changed at all and whether we might see that at some point next year.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, so given that we own the business for nine days, you know, but obviously been working with the team for a while, the life sciences business is performing very well both with strong revenue growth and strong bookings performance. The industrial-related material sciences businesses are a little bit more muted. And as we look at the numbers, it seems like the industrial businesses have bottomed out, which is encouraging. And then, obviously, as we get into owning the business longer and, in the future, we can give you more color in that.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan of Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Jack.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Marc, you know, I appreciate your perspective on the healthcare channel. There's been a little bit more noise on the provider side as of late. Just as you've talked with your customers, what are they saying about volumes? And as it pertains to the specialty diagnostics business, which of the segments need to improve to get us back to the 4% to 6% target range?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Jack, good question. As I think about the healthcare and diagnostic, it's very similar in Q3 to what we saw in Q2. What I would say is the more \u2013 the super high value added businesses, transplant diagnostics, the allergy and autoimmunity business, the clinical next-gen sequencing businesses, those businesses are performing very well.", "The more routine volume related businesses, your basic consumables you use every day, has been a little bit softer but not a change in trend. So what would have to happen for pickup in growth, two different factors could help drive it. You don't need both. Which is a little higher level of activity in the basic consumption of the products for consumables would help. And the other is, we have a number of programs that are driving our life science tools into the clinic, and they will be meaningful drivers as well.", "So the driving into the clinic, that's in our control entirely, and that puts us very optimistic about the mid-term prospects for the diagnostic business. And then we'll always take the upside if the markets get even better.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. That's helpful. And then just to follow-up on the Affymetrix integration, how that's going and any update on the array environment, any sequential changes you've seen there. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Jack, in terms of Affymetrix, let me give you an update on the integration, let me give you an update on the business performance. Integration has gone really well. We are running very smoothly there. Our synergies are running ahead of plan. We'll achieve about $11 million in synergies this year, which is $5 million to $6 million better than we had assumed for this year.", "In terms of the business performance, the bioscience business is doing very well, growing sharply, and that's very positive. The micro array business, like we mentioned last quarter, is soft. We expect it to be soft for a few more quarters as we really drive adoption of the precision medicine microarray, and we're obviously actively marketing that. So that's a quick update on Affymetrix.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "All right. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, guys. Based on what we've heard from peers in the group, I think it's fair to assert that your organic revenue growth performance in the quarter and your guidance for Q4 looks fairly solid, certainly relatively speaking. Other companies do seem to have suggested that the end of the quarter was maybe not as strong as expected and that the order book at the end of Q3 and in the early part of Q4 maybe didn't build as much as they might have expected.", "Could you comment on end of quarter and early Q4 order trends? Relatedly, if there's anything notable by geography or end market? And I guess also relatedly, in a seemingly more uncertain environment, are there any changes you're making regarding spending or operational plans relative to how you were planning a quarter ago?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, in terms of the sequencing of the quarter, nothing really jumped out as particularly meaningful in terms of what happened in each month. And obviously we have the benefit of the first three weeks of October's results, so if they were off that trend line, that would have factored into our thinking, and it wasn't. So from that perspective, we didn't really see anything from a calendarization that was any particular impact.", "In terms of spending and those things, we're managing the business like we always do, which is we spend aggressively in the areas to drive value-added, and we're very conservative and frugal on the things that are low value-added, and that's kind of how we run the company day in and day out. So no significant changes on that front either.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks for that, Marc. And then a quick follow-up. Would you guys be willing to provide growth by end market in Europe and parse out how growth compared in Eastern versus Western Europe?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I don't know the growth by end market by Europe because we don't manage the company that way. Qualitatively, Western Europe was a little bit stronger than Eastern Europe in terms of performance, but that's not a change in the trajectory over the last several quarters. But that's what we've seen. And from recollection, Germany had a pretty good quarter in terms of growth within the Western Europe, but that's not implying anything in particular about any of the other countries.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks again.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Steve, are you there?", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I am. Sorry. Got a little feedback there. Good morning and thanks for taking the questions. So we've covered a lot of ground here in the Q&A and discussions around what's going on out in the end markets. But, Marc, I wonder if you could put it into broader perspective for us and think about as you go into business planning for 2017, from your perspective, what are the two or three things that you want to focus on most acutely as you make a decision about where to put the budget within the 4% to 6% range?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, the things that I think about in planning, it always goes through the, one, new product launches and what are the exciting things we've got in the pipeline and what the impact is going to be and making sure that's well characterized. Two, any particular special causes year-over-year one way or another. And at least as I sit here today, I don't see any special effects one way or another, so next year should look like this year in terms of some of the high-level things.", "One of the things we mentioned at the beginning of the year, which we're continuing to execute on, which I'm encouraged about, is when the medical device tax was put on a two-year hiatus, we spent the savings on investing in some mid-term restructuring activities. We will get one more year of that hiatus and we will invest those monies as well. So there's no effect year-over-year, but that means we'll have invested about $30 million in actions to drive more efficiency in the second half of 2017 and 2018, which I think is really good and encouraging and is something that we embedded into our long-term model. So those are some of the things we're thinking about. And I know that Stephen is looking forward to giving a detailed set of guidance at the beginning of 2017.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And a follow-up for me is actually on competitive positioning. I think, as you can tell from the questions here in Q&A, we're all struggling to try to develop a broader perspective on the environment, given the fairly varied results in terms of growth from the companies in broader lifescience tools and diagnostics here over the last few weeks.", "Marc, do you think that you're getting stronger over the course of the year in terms of your competitive positioning? Is market share, even in certain specific verticals, a driver for you more so than it was even 12 months ago now that, in some areas, thinking about eCommerce, you're a stronger player than arguably you were 12 or 24 months ago?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, it's our job to widen the gap versus others in the industry every day, right? That's what we're paid to do is to make the company stronger and get better every day. And when I think about how we're performing this year, I think the company is performing very well. I'm very proud of the effort and the capabilities of our team, and they're delivering. So I think that's very positive.", "Obviously, we benefit from the strong competitive position we have. We have a very strong eCommerce platform, as you said. We have the largest commercial team. We have the best commercial team, in my mind. And, when I think about it, we've got great products; we've got a unique position in the emerging markets, which allows us to capitalize on those opportunities.", "I highlighted a couple during the quarter, but the way I really believe it is when I visit a customer in China, it's rationale for them to doing a disproportionate amount of their business with us because they simply get a better experience. We've got better people, better supply chain, and a more comprehensive set of offerings. So I think we're very well positioned, and we feel good about the outlook for the balance of the year and certainly as we get into 2017 and beyond.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Really appreciate the perspective. Thanks again.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just maybe one more question on the academic side. We're obviously trying to reconcile what we've seen elsewhere in the sector this earnings season versus what you guys are saying, which is clearly more dovish. And as we look at the end of this year and into next year, it seems like the overall budget, at least in the U.S., should be a little bit better, Europe hopefully stable, and China hopefully better. So if we look at sort of the global picture for academic funding, is there any reason to think why we might see pockets of softness?", "And I know you guys can only speak for yourselves, but as the prior question pointed out, we're just trying to reconcile disparate data points in the context of a generally better funding environment", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, I guess it's hard for \u2013 there's always challenges in the world. We do our very best to navigate through them so that we don't have to spend a lot of time explaining all of the things that go wrong. I think we do a good job of that because we deliver good results consistently. I guess it's \u2013 I really can't reconcile for you. I think the only two comments I can make is that, we had very good growth in chrome and mass spec. So if I look at what I have read about that, we did really well in that end market. And when I look at our clinical next-gen sequencing business, we grew very quickly. So I really can't reconcile for you what others are saying. It's hard to do.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Sure, sure. I understand that. Maybe I'd just follow up on the NGS comment you guys called out in the script. You mentioned it again here. Can you talk a little bit about the types of customers where you think you're seeing the most traction? Clearly, it's a high growth marketplace, and a rising tide floats all boats, but it has been a market where we had one pretty strong player here, and in the context of that competitive dynamic, I'm interested to know where you guys are finding the best upside and kind of the path forward to continue that momentum. Thank you", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, Isaac, our business is really focused on the clinical applications of sequencing, and we benefit from the ease of use, the low capital cost, and, most importantly, the very low volume of sample that you need to run oncology panel on our sequencer. And that's allowed for really good adoption, and you're seeing a steady cadence of new assays that we're launching, which reaffirms to our customers that we're investing and meeting their needs. So that's the area that we have seen good momentum in. Thanks, Isaac.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias of Citi. Please go ahead.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, hi, good morning. Thanks, guys. Marc, maybe just on pricing, obviously a mixed operating environment for interest and sales with industrial pretty choppy but pharma doing well. So can you maybe just touch on net pricing in the AI business and then what your expectations there are as we look out a bit?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Hi, Dan, this is Stephen. I'll take the pricing one. So we look at pricing in total for the company, and we're about 60 basis points of price. So it's very consistent with what we've seen for the rest of this year, and actually what we saw pretty much for all of last year. We're kind of lapping some of the things that we did in Japan in terms of the FX offsets, but that's going to be offset by some pricing actions we're taking in the UK as well. So pricing has been pretty consistent for us.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Okay. And then maybe just a follow-up on China and what you're seeing there with the precision medicine programs that you highlighted. I'm just curious about how you're finding predictability there or just maybe visibility there. Any reason that would be more or less sort of speculative in nature than some of the other things going on in China?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "We've been on a really nice consistent roll for a number of quarters, and having visited China twice last quarter, the business is performing well, the bookings are strong, the outlook is good, and so we really haven't seen anything that would say that visibility is any different or if there's any particular storm clouds on the horizon. The business seems to look good, and we're benefiting from our strong competitive position here.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks very much", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Operator, we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Sung Ji Nam of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.", "Sung Ji Nam - Avondale Partners LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Marc, I was wondering, you know, you guys seem to have a pretty unique diagnostic business with decent margins. Given your recent announcement about the cancer \u2013 your participation in the cancer moon shot initiative, and I believe you also have a prostate cancer testing under development, I was curious as to if your kind of interest in the diagnostic market has shifted a little bit and potentially considering, you know, higher risk opportunities.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "We have a really strong position there. It's been a core part of our business for a long time. But we really haven't changed the risk profile of it as much. We do have, obviously, a couple big investment areas that will position us for accelerating growth over time. One is in the adoption of clinical next-gen sequencing into those applications, and our announcement, as you highlight, on the cancer moon shot is an example of that. And the other is obviously in the area of mass spectrometry where we've got a fairly big program as well.", "So we're not really taking a different strategy, but we've been pursuing for a number of years on driving new applications into the clinic while benefiting from a very strong highly profitable consumables business.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, thank you for the question. Let me wrap up with just a quick comment, which is as I reflect back, we're certainly on track to deliver another excellent year, and we look forward to announcing our year-end results early in 2017.

Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Ken, thank you, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q1 call. We accomplished a lot in the quarter, and we had a great start to the year. We delivered strong financial performance on both the top- and bottom-line. We had a very productive quarter for innovation across our businesses. We continued our strong growth momentum in Asia-Pacific, and we enhanced our customer value proposition with two strategic bolt-on acquisitions while continuing to return capital to our shareholders. Our team executed well to deliver a strong Q1, and we're well positioned to deliver another excellent year.", "I'll cover each of these highlights in my remarks, starting with our financial results. We delivered excellent adjusted EPS growth in Q1, with a 16% increase to $2.08 per share. Our revenue in Q1 grew 11% year-over-year. Our adjusted operating income increased 16%, and we expanded our adjusted operating margin by 90 basis points to 22.6%. So we clearly had a great start to the year.", "Turning now to our performance by end market, in pharma and biotech, we continued to see good growth and our performance in Q1 was in the high-single-digits. The combination of good market fundamentals and the strength of our unique value proposition continues to drive demand from these customers.", "We had another strong quarter in our bioproduction business, and we also saw strong demand for our biosciences products.", "Our performance in academic and government end markets in Q1 was similar to what we saw last year and we grew in the low-single-digits. In health care and diagnostics, conditions really haven't changed since last year, and we grew in the low-single-digits in this end market as well.", "Last, in industrial and applied, we grew at the company average. Applied markets continued to be strong, and we saw good growth in our research and safety market channel with industrial customers.", "Now let me turn to our growth strategy and touch on some of the great progress we made in Q1 to position Thermo Fisher for an even stronger future. As you know, our growth strategy is based on three pillars: developing high-impact, innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering our unique customer value proposition.", "I'll start with innovation, and we got off to a strong start here as well with new products launched across our technology portfolios. Let me highlight a few of them. In Analytical Instruments, the new Thermo Scientific products we showcased at Pittcon really emphasized the success of our R&D strategy in this part of the business, which is essentially twofold.", "First, we continued to strengthen our leading mass spectrometry and chromotography platforms. And a good example of that was our new iCAP triple-quad mass spec system for clinical research in pharma QA/QC. This is an extension of our successful iCAP product line and combines high-powered analysis with simpler operation.", "Second, we're using these advanced systems to create specific workflows that are powerful yet easy for our customers to use in applications ranging from pharma compliance to clinical research. The new iCAP system allows customers to switch between single and triple-quad modes so they can keep their existing workflow as well as add new capabilities over time.", "In our Laboratory Products business, we launched a novel cloud-based application that connects electronic pipettes among individual users in the lab. It's designed to enable centralized programming, storage and sharing of protocols which increases efficiency in what has traditionally been a tedious and inefficient process that's prone to human error. This new product is a great example of how we leverage our deep applications knowledge to help our customers improve efficiency at all stages of their workflows.", "We were also pleased to learn in the quarter that our TSX Series blood bank refrigerators were recognized by the EPA as the first ENERGY STAR certified lab-grade refrigerators currently available in the market. This demonstrates our commitment to offering customers new technologies that meets their goals for sustainability as well as productivity.", "In Genetic Sciences, where our strategy is to extend the menu of assays that run on our instruments, we launched the CarrierScan Assay. The new microarray-based solution detects more than 6,000 genomic variations associated with 600 inherited diseases. CarrierScan is the first pan-ethnic research assay, which means it can serve as a single solution for an increasingly diverse population that helps labs greatly accelerate the screening process.", "Turning to the second pillar of our growth strategy, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we had another strong quarter in this region. China led the way again, with growth in the high teens, and we also reported strong growth in India and South Korea.", "Our strategy of leveraging our unique scale in (sic) [is] (7:43) driving growth across the region. And we continue to build on our industry-leading presence there as well.", "A quick note on China. I spent time with a number of our customers there a few weeks ago, and I continue to be energized by the long-term prospects for this important end market and the incredible opportunities we have to continue to gain share. The funding environment overall in China continues to be very positive. And we're well-positioned to lead in several areas that are a high priority for the government, such as precision medicine, pharmaceutical production, and environmental monitoring.", "While I was there, I participated in the opening of a new customer demo laboratory for cryo-electron microscopy at Tsinghua University, one of the world's premier academic institutions. The lab was built by the University to train China's top scientists in the use of these highly sophisticated tools, including our Titan Krios system, the gold standard for structural biology.", "At the new lab, we're also sponsoring research and educating students through hands-on cryo-EM courses provided by our experts. Understanding the structure of proteins in our blood is a key to advancing precision medicine. And our cryo-EM and Orbitrap platforms are essential to this research.", "As you recall, cryo-EM is a powerful technology that we added through our acquisition of FEI. One of our key strategic objectives in acquiring FEI is to use our leadership in life sciences to drive adoption of this technology with those customers. Our collaboration with Tsinghua University is a great example of how we're leveraging our leading presence to achieve this goal.", "I'll make a quick comment on our progress with FEI, now that it's been part of Thermo Fisher for about six months. The integration is going very well. The technologies are fantastic. And we're thrilled to have the FEI team as part of the company.", "In terms of financial performance, we're running ahead of the year one accretion target that we articulated at the time of the acquisition. This is driven by both the contribution of synergies and the strong growth of the FEI business. Longer term, we're on track to deliver our year three synergy targets. And we look forward to the new growth opportunities we have now that FEI is part of our company.", "Turning to the last pillar of our growth strategy, our customer value proposition. In the first quarter we completed two bolt-on acquisitions that strengthen our offering in areas with great long-term growth potential for us, bioproduction and digital science.", "In bioproduction we acquired Finesse Solutions, a leader in the development of scalable measurement and control capabilities. These proprietary universal systems can be integrated seamlessly with our single-use technologies to further optimize the bioproduction workflow. We continue to increase our bioproduction capabilities and capacity to build on our strong momentum in this high-growth market.", "The other opportunity I want to highlight is the emerging trend towards the digital lab. To add to our capabilities here, we acquired a small but well-respected company called Core Informatics. Core provides a leading cloud-based information management platform that's used in a range of applications from biopharma and genomics to applied markets and manufacturing. This is a scalable platform that complements our existing informatics offering. It's another step in our strategy to develop new digital solutions that support the way our customers want to work, connecting instruments, data, and scientific expertise.", "Let me give you a quick summary of our capital deployment activities so far this year. We had a busy Q1 including strategic M&A, stock buybacks, and dividends. And in April, we continued to deploy our capital, buying back an additional $250 million of our shares. So at this point we've deployed just over $1.1 billion of our capital year-to-date.", "Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising our guidance to reflect our strong Q1 performance, a slightly more favorable FX environment, and the recent acquisitions we completed. Stephen will cover the details. But at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion, which would now result in 7% to 8% growth over 2016.", "In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $9.12 to $9.28 for 2017, for 10% to 12% growth over 2016.", "Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our takeaways from Q1. First, we delivered strong financial performance on the top and bottom line. We also continued to strengthen our position with strategic investments in innovation, emerging markets, and our customer value proposition. We feel good about our strong start to the year. And we're confident we'll deliver another excellent year in 2017.", "With that I'm going to hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll take you through our first quarter results for the total company. I'll then provide some color on our four business segments, and conclude with our updated 2017 guidance.", "Before I get into the details, let me start with a high-level view of how the first quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call.", "We delivered 4% organic growth in Q1 which was approximately one point higher than we had expected at the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by strong operational execution during the quarter.", "From an earnings standpoint, we finished $0.06 higher in Q1 than we'd assumed in the midpoint of our initial guidance. This was primarily driven by the pull-through on the additional point of organic growth and a stronger-than-expected contribution from the FEI acquisition. So we're clearly off to a great start to the year.", "Now let me give you more color on the quarter. Starting with our total company financial performance for Q1, as you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS by 16% to $2.08. And GAAP EPS was $1.40, up 39% from Q1 last year. On the top-line, our reported revenue grew 11% year-over-year. The components of our Q1 reported revenue included 4% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% headwind from foreign exchange. Looking at growth by geography in Q1, North America grew in the low-single-digits while Europe grew in the mid-single-digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low-double-digits with continued momentum in China, which grew in the high-teens, and Rest of the World was flat organically for the quarter.", "Turning to our operational performance, Q1 adjusted operating income increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was 22.6%, up 90 basis points from Q1 of last year. Looking at the components of our adjusted operating margin performance in Q1, we achieved solid expansion from our organic growth driven by strong contributions from our PPI Business System and volume leverage and this is partially offset by strategic investments and the expected modest headwind from acquisitions. Foreign exchange did not have a material impact on operating margin during the quarter.", "Moving onto the details of the P&L, total company adjusted gross margin came in at 49.3% in Q1, up 110 basis points from the prior year. The increase in gross margin in Q1 is primarily attributed to the positive impact of our PPI Business System and acquisitions; this is partially offset by strategic investments. Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 22.2% of revenue, which is 20 basis points favorable to Q1 2016 and R&D expense came in at 4.5% of revenue, up 40 basis points versus Q1 last year. And R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue in Q1 was 6.8%, up from 6.4% in Q1 2016, primarily due to the impact of the FEI acquisition.", "Looking at our results below the line, net interest expense was $117 million, up $22 million from Q1 2016, mainly as a result of incremental debt financing to support our capital deployment actions over the past year. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter of $5 million which is $4 million more of an expense than 2016, driven primarily by changes in non-operating foreign exchange. Our adjusted tax rate in the quarter was 14% flat to last year, just slightly higher than the expected full-year tax rate of 13.3% due to the timing of discrete tax line items within 2017. The average diluted shares were 394.1 million, down 4.6 million year-over-year, mainly result of the buybacks, partially offset by option dilution.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations through Q1 was $360 million and free cash flow was $270 million after deducting net capital expenditures of $90 million. Free cash flow is $45 million favorable to Q1 2016. We ended the quarter with $715 million in cash and investments. As for capital deployment activities, we had a busy quarter. And as you heard from Marc, we closed two bolt-on acquisitions, Finesse Solutions and Core Informatics.", "We also completed a total of $500 million of share buybacks in Q1 and returned $60 million to shareholders through dividends. As Marc also mentioned earlier in Q2, we also completed an incremental $250 million of share buybacks. That brings us to $750 million of share buybacks for the year, which is right in line with our previous guidance. Our total debt at the end of Q1 was $17.1 billion, up $500 million sequentially from Q4, mainly driven by the increase in short-term debt relating to our acquisition and share repurchase activities. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 3.6 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA.", "And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, ROIC improved once again in the quarter, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC at the end of Q1 was 10%, up 10 basis points sequentially from Q4 and up 40 basis points over Q1 2016. So we continue to see good underlying performance in this metric.", "So now I'll provide some color on the performance of our four business segments. Starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue increased 12% in Q1 and organic revenue grew at 7%. In the quarter, we continued to see strong growth across all four of our businesses in this segment, bioproduction, next-generation sequencing, genetic sciences, and biosciences. Q1 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 23% and adjusted operating margin was 31.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw strong productivity, volume pull-through and favorable business mix, partially offset by strategic investments and the dilutive impact of acquisitions.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, which includes the FEI acquisition, reported revenue increased 39% in Q1 and organic growth was 5%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spec businesses. Q1 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 72% and adjusted operating margin was 18.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year. In the quarter, we saw good volume leverage, strong productivity and a positive impact from the FEI acquisition. This was partially offset by strategic investments and foreign exchange.", "Turning to Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q1, total revenue grew 1% and organic revenue growth was 2%. We saw good growth in our clinical diagnostics business. Adjusted operating increased 2% in Q1 and adjusted operating margin was 27%, up 10 basis points from Q1 at the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively affected by good productivity, volume pull-through, and favorable FX, offset partially by strategic investments.", "Finally, in the Lab Products and Services segment, Q1 reported revenue increased 3% and organic revenue growth was 4%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in both our Channel and Laboratory Products businesses. Adjusted operating income in this segment decreased 9% and adjusted operating margin was 12.7%, down 170 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from both volume leverage and productivity; however, this was more than offset by the expected impact of unfavorable business mix by the Biopharma Services business and, to a lesser extent, strategic investments.", "So now I'll review the details of our updated full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. We're increasing revenue guidance by $110 million at the midpoint and increasing our adjusted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 at the midpoint.", "Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue. We continue to expect to deliver 4% organic revenue growth for the full-year 2017. Of the $110 million increase in revenue guidance at the midpoint, $50 million reflects a slightly less adverse foreign-exchange environment, and $60 million reflects the expected increase in contribution from acquisitions, principally the addition of Finesse Solutions and Core Informatics, as well as an increase in the revenue outlook for FEI.", "And in terms of adjusted earnings per share, the $0.05 increase at the midpoint of our guidance reflects $0.02 dilution from the Core Informatics acquisition, a $0.04 benefit from improved operational performance, and a $0.03 benefit from less-adverse FX environment.", "And finally, with one quarter of strong performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $200 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.16.", "So to sum all this up, the revised 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $19.51 billion to $19.71 billion. That would represent 7% to 8% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just over 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and FX is expected to be a headwind of just under 1.5%.", "In terms of earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.12 to $9.28 with a midpoint of $9.20. This represents growth of 10% to 12% versus 2016. Excluding the negative impact of FX, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 14%.", "A few other details behind revised 2017 guidance. We're assuming that foreign exchange is now a $250 million revenue headwind for 2017, or just under 1.5%. The FX headwind on adjusted earnings per share is now assumed to be $0.17 or just over 2%. We expect acquisitions will contribute just over 4.5% to our reported revenue growth in 2017 and $0.31 of adjusted earnings per share increase year-over-year. We continue to expect 40 to 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion year-over-year, consistent with our prior guidance.", "We're expecting net interest expense to be about $450 million, which is at the high-end of our previous range, primarily as a result of the incremental debt financing for acquisitions we completed in Q1.", "We're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be 13.3% for the year, consistent with the previous guidance. And as a reminder, this does not include the benefit of any potential tax reform that may occur in the U.S.", "In terms of capital deployment, our guidance continues to assume $750 million of share buybacks in 2017, and these have all been fully executed. We continue to assume to return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends, and our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million; no change from the previous guidance. We're still expecting about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for the full year 2017, consistent with previous guidance. And full year average diluted shares are estimated to be in the range of 393 million to 394 million, also consistent with previous guidance.", "And finally, in terms of phasing we're expecting organic growth to be relatively even over the remainder of the year. And for adjusted EPS we expect that it'd be phased across the remaining nine months of the year in a similar way to the same period in 2016. As always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoints as the most likely view of how we see results playing out.", "So in summary we executed well in Q1, and we're well-positioned to achieve our goals for the year. With that I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to take questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Derik. How are you?", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. So lot of questions, but I'll limit it to one just in the spirit of things. So some of your competitors were talking about some weakness in the U.S. pharma businesses. It doesn't look like that materialized for you. Could you just talk a little bit about that environment? And I guess the commentary on the LPS margin being offset by the mix of biopharma services, is that \u2013 could you elaborate a little bit more on that in terms of what you're seeing on that one? Then I've got a follow-up.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Sure. Derik, thanks for the question. At a high-level, when I think about the quarter, obviously a very good start to the year. And the team executed well, serving all of the markets. We came out of the quarter very confident with the 4% organic growth guidance that we outlined back in January.", "In terms of the color around pharma and biotech, it was a good quarter. It was once again our strongest end market. As I mentioned, it grew in the high single digits. In addition to the strength in bioproduction and biosciences, we also had good strength from chromatography and mass spectrometry. So really a good quarter.", "As Stephen mentioned in the LPS segment, you saw margin dilution. That was really driven by something we expected in our biopharma services business, which was at the end, in Q4, one of our customers canceled a large Phase III study, a very public one. It had nothing to do with us. The study itself was canceled. And that was a good-sized contract and a profitable piece of business. So it shows up really more in the margin profile within LPS. And we'll sunset that after the third quarter of this year.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So that was the clinical trial logistics business, right? That...", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Exactly. Correct.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. All right. And then...", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "A single study that was canceled, basically.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thanks for the color on that. And I guess as you \u2013 have you noticed any sort of slowdown or hesitation in the academic labs? It doesn't look like it based on your 7% LSS number. But I would love some commentary on that. Then I'll shut up.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Well, you don't have to shut up. But from the quarter, academic and government was low single digits, very similar to what we've been seeing in recent quarters; Asia-Pacific being strongest. In terms of the U.S. academic and government, we grew slightly. And we would have expected by this point to be operating with a budget as opposed to under a continuing resolution. So we didn't see really significant change. If you get into the details of the U.S. academic and government, consumables was stronger than instrumentation. But again in aggregate, a low-level of growth in the U.S.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Derik.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. Nice quarter, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you, Tycho.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Maybe starting with FEI, obviously the commentary there pretty constructive. Can you talk a little bit on demand trends for cryo-EM adoption and interest you're seeing from pharma? It sounds like you're starting to bundle a little bit with Orbitrap per your commentary.", "And then separately on the semi-side of that business, can you talk a little bit about how much you're seeing a pickup there? I guess what I'm getting at is, in prior cycles that business can be kind of high single digit or double digit at the right point of the cycle. So just wondering what the inflection point looks like for that business.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Tycho, thanks for the question. Good chance to just talk about FEI broadly. First, from an integration perspective, going very well. Really a fabulous team and very good complement to our company.", "In terms of the growth performance, we had a very strong quarter within FEI. And we're expecting to have very strong growth. As you know, because we won't anniversary it until the very end of the third quarter, it's not going to be meaningful contributor to our organic growth. But on a pro forma basis, the business is growing very well.", "When you look at the pieces of the business, the life sciences portion of the business, which is driven by cryo-EM, is going incredibly strongly and there's excellent interest both in the academic community as well as you're seeing the beginning of interest in the pharmaceutical community as well.", "We've had some orders put in place, we also had, importantly, those customers kind of sharing some of the academic instruments, doing some studies which shows their interest and, ultimately, we think that they'll become purchasers as well. So that's very strong growth. Material science, which incorporates all of the non-life-sciences, semiconductor, academic, material science, oil and gas, every single thing that's not life sciences within the FEI business had very strong bookings growth in the quarter. Revenue growth was more muted in aggregate, but that will pick up as the year goes on, and that's driven by semiconductor being very strong on the bookings side. So a very encouraging first six months of the integration and we feel very good about the FEI business and how we'll add value to it and how it will add value to Thermo Fisher Scientific.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then maybe for a follow-up, just on industrial commentary in general, you talked about research and safety doing pretty well, I think last quarter you've made some comments about metals and mining picking up. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about incrementally relative to last quarter where you've seen some improvement? And we have heard some peers about more of a pickup in Asia industrial as well. So just wondering if you could comment on that, too.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, of course. Thanks, Tycho. So as I mentioned in the beginning, industrial and applied grew at about the company average for the quarter. Applied markets were good. Industrial clearly is progressing as we had talked about last quarter. So when you look at the pieces, the shorter cycle portions of the business and the channel reflects that as would some of the lower purchase price, lower aggregate priced instrumentation, had a good quarter in terms of growth and what was also encouraging is that bookings were continuing to grow in the longer cycle products, the things that we mentioned last quarter. So that's two quarters in a row of bookings growth there, and that bodes well for the industrial end markets to play out in line with the expectations that we had articulated back in January, which is growth around the company average, and that would be a nice improvement over what we had seen over the last few years. So that's encouraging.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good morning. What assumptions are embedded into full year guidance for revenue growth by end market and geography? And how have they have changed, if at all, relative to what you embedded into guidance coming into the year?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, I'll take that one. So, Doug, nothing much has really changed when we look at it by end market from where we were at the beginning of the year. Some minor puts and takes across it. So biopharma will still be the strongest grower, expecting that to be kind of mid-to high-single-digits. Industrial and applied, as Marc said, would be about company average, and diagnostics and health care, and academic and government would be about kind of low-single-digits for 2017, same as 2016.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Stephen. And...", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "From a geographic...", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Oh, go ahead, sorry.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "From a geographic standpoint, Doug, Asia-Pacific, really no significant changes from the guidance back in January. Asia-Pacific, by far the strongest, and both Europe and North America just below the company average would be our expectations.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. So just a couple of quick follow-ups. I mean, it does seem like pharma is holding up at least as well as expected, if not better, NIH uncertainty doesn't seem to be hitting you and you already had low expectations for that end market and industrial seems to be tracking a smidge ahead of plan. You beat your Q1 expectations as you indicated in your prepared remarks. But why not bump up organic revenue guidance a bit based on all of these observations? Is it just a function of being early in the year and wanting to have a little bit more confidence before making any changes?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, you know Doug, it's a good question. The way that we think about it is twofold. First, it is a bit early in the year, and, well, obviously we're encouraged by the good execution in Q1, so it's a bit early to make changes on that. The second thing is one of the assumptions that's embedded in the guidance both in January, in particular was that we would be operating with a U.S. budget and, obviously, that budget that's been talked about is going to have a nice increase for NIH funding. Obviously we're sitting here at the end of April and we're still under continuing resolution. So that's something that we're just paying attention to and, obviously, three days ago, the news was discouraging, this morning the news is encouraging, and we just look forward to actually going from continuing resolution to budget and that can be a positive as the year unfolds.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And one last follow-up on this topic. Marc, you have better visibility than many if not most of your peers given the size of your business in China and how much time you spend there. Do you have any sense if there's stimulus-like activities or anything else that might be contributing to outsized growth in the near-term? Really what I'm getting at is it doesn't sound like you have any concerns about the sustainability of recent strong trends in China. I just want to make sure you haven't picked up on anything that would change your conviction on the durability of trends.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "No, when I was in China at the beginning of April, where we're seeing this excellent, excellent activity is very much aligned with the five-year plan. It's not a stimulus-driven thing. It's really around precision medicine. We had a great interaction with a number of thought leaders there, and they're very aligned with what we're doing and obviously in food safety, environmental and the expansion of healthcare. Those were really core parts of the five-year plan in China. So we're not \u2013 we hadn't heard much about, if any, about a short-term stimulus effect but rather really alignment with fundamental government priorities. So we think we're very well positioned and, obviously, have a very strong team there.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks again.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Jack.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I wanted to start digging on mass spec and chromatography. You talked about the nice growth there. I was just wondering if any of the underlying drivers have changed. And, Marc, do you have any updated views on the clinical opportunity?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, Jack, good questions. From the chroma, mass spec area, we continue to drive good growth. We saw strong performance in our high-end mass spectrometers, the Orbitrap family in particular was very strong, chromatography was quite strong across the board, so there wasn't anything that particularly jumped out as something special. Obviously, the applied markets in Asia helped drive some of the growth, but we saw a really widespread adoption across the business. So that perspective we feel good about. In terms of our clinical mass spec, a program that something we're targeting for a launch in 2018 and we're looking forward to it. As we get to some of the upcoming conferences, ASMS, in terms of the research market, you'll see some really exciting launches. And in AACC, you'll get some more views on what we're doing in the clinical space. So this late spring and summer will be super-exciting for Thermo Fisher Scientific as well.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great, looking forward to it. And then just wanted to follow-up on the margins in Analytical Instruments, maybe for Stephen, up 350 bps. I know some of this is mix, but how much leverage do you think you can drive here with better top-line performance through the year?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah. So roughly half of the margin expansion really came from the FEI acquisition. The rest came from the core business. So there is good volume pull-through and using our PPI Business System, we think we can drive significant leverage of additional revenue.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Jack.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just two quick ones, one for Marc and one for Stephen. Marc, during the quarter, there's been some, I suppose, up and down in terms of sentiment and expectations around bioprocess, clearly, a good quarter for you guys. It's an interesting business relative to the business overall, in part because it's a very long-cycle business. I would think you have a good degree of visibility in terms of capital projects and capacity plans for your customer base. It'd just be helpful, given all the questions out there, for you to give us a sense of what you're hearing from the customer base in terms of how they're thinking about capacity needs and what that means for the business.", "And then one quick one for Stephen. Look, really good quarter on the margin front, right? 90 basis points and guidance is still for 40 to 60 basis points. Can you just help us understand why, over the balance of the year, we might expect to see some moderation in the year-on-year trend? Or is this another case where we're just taking kind of a wait-and-see approach given how early it is in the year? Thanks a bunch.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve. I'll take the margin one first. So we delivered 90 basis points of expansion in Q1. For the full-year, we're still \u2013 I reiterated 40 to 60 basis points with a midpoint of 50 basis points. So if you do the math, we would be delivering just under 40 basis points for the remainder of the year, on average. A couple of key drivers between that and the Q1 expansion: timing of investments, more loaded into Q2 and Q3, a little bit in Q4; and then the other piece is that we had a very profitable stub period in Q3 last year from the FEI acquisition. We had a lot of revenue and very little cost, so that's causing a little bit of pressure on the Q3 margin. But overall, 50 basis points for the year.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Steve, in terms of bioprocess, really a very strong fundamental end market. And we have a very, very strong competitive position. So we've had good growth for a number of years in that business. Q1 was a good quarter for us as well, with high growth as well.", "As a reminder, we have leadership positions in the media used to grow the product. And then obviously in terms of the single-use technologies that the products are made in, we have market leadership positions.", "We're excited about the Finesse acquisition, because it complements our single-use technologies. We've been expanding our capacity in terms of our manufacturing plants over the last few years. And we've had a number of openings, both in Grand Island and in Inchinnan in Scotland, where the customer feedback has been incredibly positive. So we feel good about the underlying aspects.", "There's always some lumpiness in the business, so we don't over-read that too much. I mean, yes, you have a lot of visibility. But sometimes shipments happen in one quarter, move to the next quarter. But for us, we've had pretty smooth growth over the last few years.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks a bunch. Have a good morning.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, guys. I just want to dig a little bit more into the organic growth assumptions by division for the rest of the year. And starting with Diagnostics, I mean you had a pretty tough comp in the first quarter, so that's understandable. But as we think about the rest of the year, is it fair to assume that the organic growth will pick up?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So in terms of what was in our initial guidance and still in our revised current guidance, Life Sciences Solutions will be the fastest-growing segment that we have. Analytical Instruments will be about the company average. Lab Products and Services will be slightly higher than company average. And Diagnostics will be similar to what we saw last year, is the way we're thinking about that.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then just in terms of LPS, if I think about the overall end market, you guys went through the various customer segments. I'm curious about just market share trends. Where do you feel like you're executing the best in terms of share gains in LPS? Where could you be doing better? Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, when I look at the three sub-components of Lab Products and Services, you have the channel business, you have our manufacturing business for lab products, which is basically when you walk through a lab, kind of everything you see, the plastics, the equipment, the refrigeration, all of that. And you have our clinical trials logistics, or what we call biopharma services.", "I actually think all three teams executed very well in the quarter, right? And when I look at the channel business, we had very strong growth in the channel business. Really both in North America and Europe, the business is doing very well. Lab Products had a very strong start to the year in terms of growth.", "And when I look at the biopharma services business, the activity excluding sort of the one large trial that a customer discontinued, I feel good about the execution there. And then obviously that's going to take a few quarters to sunset. So I don't think there was areas that we under-executed. But we always try to be better, right? And our goal is to continue to drive additional growth, and our teams are focused on that.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Isaac.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citi. Your line is now open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Good morning, guys. Thank you. Marc, maybe just back on FEIC. Can you just talk a bit about where you are in the new product cycle there? When you guys did the deal, Don [Kania] sounded pretty good on some of the things coming down the pike. So just curious about how much of what you're seeing has to do with new introductions? And then what you think about portfolio additions or refreshes there?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "In terms of where the momentum is coming from currently, it's really the existing range of products. We have some exciting products in the pipeline. So that will help sustain a very bright outlook for the business. But the momentum you see right now is not really being driven by new products, per se. So that's something that will unfold as the year progresses.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. And then maybe just back on industrial, I'm looking at the developed markets. Can you compare U.S. to Europe? And to the extent that the recovery carries through the year, do you see one of those leading the way versus the other? Or should it be pretty balanced? Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I would say that from the industrial, our channel business performed well in both geographies. So we didn't see a big difference versus our expectations there. I would expect pretty balanced improvements in both the U.S. and Europe and encouraging signs in Asia.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks a ton.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney. Your line is now open.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey, guys. This is actually Bill March on for Paul. How are you doing?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "First question, if I could, on microarray. Last summer, you talked about seeing some pricing pressure from a competitor in that business. And with the new product launch, just an update on that end market and your channel strategy there.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah, so in terms \u2013 Bill, thanks for the question. In terms of the microarray business, we're expecting modest organic growth for 2017 for that business, as we said shortly after the acquisition. The first year of ownership, which we sunsetted in March, was softer for that business, primarily about pricing that the competitor had dropped during the sale process of that business. And we launched a number of products and commercial initiatives, and we expect to see some momentum build as we move through the course of 2017.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. And then just one question on organic growth in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of what the organic growth was for recurring revenues versus instruments? Just trying to understand the growth dynamics, considering the tough 1Q 2016 comp with the extra week of selling days. Thanks, guys. Have a good one.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Bill.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So the growth was actually good across both instruments and consumables for us. Yeah, so good growth across both areas.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.", "Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. My first question, Marc, has your outlook on the U.S. changed at all given the discussion of cuts in science funding and also environmental?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yeah. In terms of the outlook for the U.S., not really. Pretty consistent with the original guidance provided we get a budget at some point in time, right? The continuing resolution is probably a month later going on and we had put into our original guidance we would've thought sometime in early April we would move to a budget, something of that standpoint in our original plan. So if that plays out, then the U.S. should be similar to what we thought. In terms of the science funding, Congress continues to be very focused on strong growth and support for NIH in particular. You can see that in the 21st Century Cures, you can see that in the funding for the Cancer Moonshot. I've had the opportunity to be in D.C. and meet with a number of members of leadership and there's strong support there from that perspective. So that's \u2013 that we're focused on making sure that that continues and feel like that's \u2013 it should be okay.", "Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And I know your environmental business is headquartered in China, but nothing to flag on the environmental front?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "No, I thought about that in more detail as we're in the discussion around policy, around the EPA. So obviously the business is primarily driven by activities outside the U.S. in terms of our air monitoring business in particular, primarily in China. In terms of the U.S., the Federal EPA is a tiny customer directly. So truly, hundreds of thousands of dollars, nothing significant. In terms of \u2013 bigger customers are really the states' EPAs that do the monitoring of the air quality and those regulators are typically more stringent than the federal level, so that's encouraging. Longer-term, obviously, a less desire for regulation on EPA is going to be a longer-term headwind for the air quality business. And to frame the magnitude domestically, that business is maybe $50 million, roughly in size. So it's a very small business. Short-term, you don't really see any effect. And with these policies, no new regulations go into effect over the next four years, then obviously that has some longer-term headwinds on that business.", "Dan Leonard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you for all the color.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Dan.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Operator, we're going to take one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Catherine Schulte with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. Going back to China, you talked about being well-positioned to continue to gain share there. Are there particular areas within your portfolio or particular end markets where you're seeing the most share gains in China or is it more broad-based?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "We've had broad-based success, Catherine, but clearly precision medicine, the food safety, kind of chromatography and mass spectrometry, genetic sciences, businesses have done very well. There's lots of demand and interest in vaccines and pharmaceutical production. That's been good for both our biosciences business and bioproduction. So it's been pretty broad-based but precision medicine, food safety are probably the two areas that jump out the most to us as big opportunities for continued momentum.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks for the question.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So let me wrap up the call. First, thank you for joining us. We're very pleased to have delivered a strong start to the year. We feel we're very well positioned to deliver another great year in 2017. And of course, thanks for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone.", "Operator", "And this concludes today's conference call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.", "Thank you. I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin you call.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until November 3, 2017. A copy of the press release of our third quarter 2017 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our third quarter 2017 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So with that, I'll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our Q3 call.", "I am pleased to report that Q3 was another excellent quarter for Thermo Fisher Scientific. We achieved strong growth on both the top and bottom line thanks to sharp execution by our team. We had a number of developments in the quarter that strengthened our leadership and innovation and in emerging markets. And we significantly enhanced our customer value proposition by adding new capabilities through the acquisition of Patheon, which we were able to complete earlier than expected. With an excellent nine months behind us, we're well positioned to achieve our growth goals for the year.", "So let me start with a quick overview of our Q3 financial highlights. First, we delivered another quarter of strong adjusted EPS performance, achieving a 14% increase to $2.31 per share. Our revenue in Q3 also grew 14% year over year. Our adjusted operating income increased 13%.", "Before I turn to our end markets, I wanted to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our teams. The natural disasters during the past couple of months have been unprecedented, and our teams have managed through very effectively. I've been inspired by how our colleagues across the company have stepped in to offer their support in many different ways from both a humanitarian and an operational perspective. For us, the most significant impact was in Puerto Rico. About 700 colleagues and their families are located on the island, and we were relieved to learn that they were all safe.", "Even with tough challenges at home, it was humbling to see colleagues return to work focused on doing everything they could to meet customer requirements. It reinforced our culture of intensity and involvement, which is the foundation for how we work every day, but really stands out in times like these. Our legacy Patheon site in Manati, Puerto Rico is the only one still experiencing disruption, but we're making steady progress in getting the facility back to full operation.", "Now let me provide you some color on our Q3 performance relative to our key end markets. Starting with pharma and biotech, we grew in the mid-single digits in Q3. Our chromatography and mass spectrometry and biosciences businesses performed well. We also had strong growth in our research and safety market channel. Our value proposition for these customers remain a key competitive advantage for us, and we continue to build on our leading position.", "Diagnostics and healthcare grew in the low single digits, in line with what we've been seeing all year, with good growth in our transplant and immunodiagnostic businesses.", "In academic and government, we were pleased to report mid-single-digit growth, driven by strong performance in Europe and China.", "Last, in industrial and applied, we continued to benefit from increasing global demand and grew here in the mid-single digits. We saw particular strength across our analytical instrument businesses in Asia-Pacific.", "We also continue to make excellent progress in setting Thermo Fisher up for an even stronger future. As you know, the three elements of our growth strategy are: developing high-impact innovative new products; leveraging our scale in Asia-Pacific and emerging markets; and delivering a unique value proposition to our customers. I emphasize these each quarter because it illustrates our commitment to a consistent and well-defined strategy that continues to strengthen our competitive position.", "So with that, I'll get into our Q3 highlights, starting with innovation. First, we launched four new Thermo Scientific products at the Microscopy & Microanalysis meeting in early August to strengthen our leadership in electron microscopy.", "For material science applications, we launched two new scanning electron microscopes, the Quattro and the Talos F200i, to help scientists advance nanomaterials research. And for life sciences applications, we launched the Krios G3i and Glacios Cryo-EM systems to make the analysis of proteins and other biomolecular structures faster and easier. Our goal is to bring Cryo-EM to a broader range of scientists and raise the standards of performance and workflow automation.", "We were also very pleased to learn in early October that the three scientists who won the Nobel Prize in chemistry work with our Cryo-EM systems. As a result of their efforts, scientists can now routinely produce high-resolution 3D images of protein structures. These developments can lead to a better understanding of biological function and ultimately to new therapies.", "As you know, we gained these groundbreaking capabilities through our acquisition of FEI, which is part of our analytical instruments offering. We surpassed the one-year anniversary of this transaction in late September, and the teams are doing a great job with the integration. The business continues to perform extremely well, and we're on track to achieve our synergy targets.", "Another notable launch in our Analytical Instruments business was our new line of Thermo Scientific air-quality monitors, called the iQ Series. These new instruments are designed to help global customers in the power industry and government agencies more easily gather and manage critical air quality data. The iQ Series platform includes mobile applications for remote monitoring and control as well as wireless connectivity and enhanced services.", "I also want to quickly mention that our new mass spectrometry systems launched at ASMS [American Society for Mass Spectrometry] in June, including the Q Exactive HF-X and our new Altis and Quantis triple-quads, have been exceptionally well received. Our innovative mass spec platforms are really resonating with customers working in both research and applied markets.", "Last, I'll touch on a significant development in our Life Science Solutions business. Our Dynabead technology was integral to the first FDA-approved gene therapy, which will be used to treat a specific form of leukemia in children and young adults. These magnetic beads are able to isolate, activate, and amplify T-cells that have been genetically programmed to identify and fight cancer cells in individual patients. This groundbreaking innovation in gene therapy was a result of our longstanding collaboration with Novartis. It's another great example of our commitment to advance precision medicine by partnering with leaders in industry, government, and academia.", "Turning to our second key growth driver, Asia-Pacific and emerging markets, we continued our strong performance in the region in Q3. China again led the way with growth in the high teens, and we also had strong results in South Korea and India.", "In China, we continued to build on our leading presence with the opening of our Precision Medicine Customer Experience Center in Guangzhou in the quarter. The facility is an impressive showcase for our wide range of workflow solutions to advance research in genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. And it also serves as a hub for customer training, collaboration, and application development.", "This milestone is a continuation of our strategic collaboration with the Guangzhou government. Earlier this year, we kicked off another collaboration with the Mab-Venture Pharmaceutical to jointly establish a new center to accelerate the development of biopharmaceuticals. Guangzhou is at the heart of healthcare innovation in China, and these are good examples of our in-China for-China strategy to introduce new capabilities geared specifically to local customers.", "Our third growth driver is our customer value proposition, and we continued to invest significantly to enhance our offering and strengthen our competitive position. As you know, in late August we closed our acquisition of Patheon, which was ahead of the timeline we communicated when we announced the transaction back in May. We welcomed 9,000 new colleagues to our team, and it was great to be at the Greenville, North Carolina site to participate in the day-one event.", "I've been at a number of the facilities. The operations are impressive, and the teams are energized to take the great business they've built to the next level as part of Thermo Fisher. We're only two months into the integration, but we're already more excited about the opportunities we have to become an even stronger partner for our pharma and biotech customers.", "As we communicated previously, we expect to realize total synergies of approximately $120 million by year three following the close. This would consist of approximately $90 million of cost synergies and about $30 million of adjusted operating income benefit from revenue-related synergies. It's early in the integration but we're off to a great start, and we look forward to updating you on our progress over time.", "So it was another active year for capital deployment. As you know, in addition to buying back our stock, we continued to strengthen our strategic position by completing a number of acquisitions, with Patheon being the largest this year.", "In terms of our short-term capital deployment priorities, they're twofold. First, with the close of the Patheon acquisition, we're already paying down debt. And second, the manner in which we financed the Patheon acquisition also gives us the capacity to continue to capitalize on M&A opportunities. Our pipeline is active, and we continue to evaluate new opportunities to create shareholder value.", "Let me now turn to our guidance for 2017. As you saw in our press release, we're raising both our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance for the full year. This reflects the addition of Patheon, the strength of our operational performance, and our ongoing commitment to delivering the benefits of a more favorable FX environment. Stephen will cover the details, but at a high level, we're raising our revenue guidance to a new range of $20.50 billion to $20.66 billion, which would now result in 12% to 13% growth over 2016. In terms of our adjusted EPS, we're raising our guidance to a new range of $9.29 to $9.38 for 2017, which also represents 12% to 13% growth year over year.", "Before I turn the call over to Stephen, let me summarize our key takeaways from Q3. We delivered another excellent quarter financially and operationally. We completed our acquisition of Patheon, and the integration is off to a strong start. We made terrific progress in the past nine months, and we're on track to deliver another excellent year.", "With that, I'll now hand the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I'll take you through an overview of our third quarter results for the total company, and then I'll provide some color on our four business segments and wrap up with an updated 2017 guidance.", "Before I get into the details, let me remind you that our results now reflect the addition of the Patheon acquisition, which we closed on August 29. Patheon's results are now part of the Laboratory Products and Services segment.", "So with that, let me start with a high-level view of how the third quarter performed versus our expectations at the time of the last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we delivered a very strong quarter with 5% organic growth in Q3, which was above the midpoint of our previous guidance range and was driven by strong operational execution.", "We were also able to deliver $0.11 more adjusted earnings per share in Q3 than we had assumed in the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by four factors of roughly equal magnitude: the pull-through on the incremental organic growth; a more favorable foreign exchange environment; the timing of our discrete tax planning actions; and the contributions from Patheon.", "Now let me give you more color on the quarter, starting with our total company financial performance. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q3 by 14% to $2.31. GAAP EPS was $1.34, up 13% from Q3 last year. On the top line, our reported revenue grew 14% year over year. The components of our Q3 reported revenue included 5% organic growth, 8% growth from acquisitions, and a 1% tailwind from foreign exchange.", "Looking at our growth by geography in Q3, Europe grew in the mid-single digits. North America grew in the low single digits. Asia-Pacific grew in the low double digits, including high teens growth in China. And finally, rest of the world grew in the mid-single digits.", "Turning to our operational performance, Q3 adjusted operating income increased 13% and adjusted operating margin was 22.9%, which contracted 10 basis points from Q3 of last year. Patheon was 40 basis points dilutive to margins in the quarter and FX a further 10 basis points dilution.", "As a reminder, Patheon is a scale acquisition, with gross margins and adjusted operating income margins lower than the company average. So as we incorporate the results of Patheon into our financials over the first 12 months, it will have a dilutive impact to year-over-year margin expansion.", "The rest of the business saw good margin expansion, driven by our PPI Business System and volume leverage, partially offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments.", "Adjusted gross margin came in at 48.4% in Q3. This represents a contraction of 50 basis points from the prior year. The combination of Patheon and FX lowered gross margins by 100 basis points in the quarter. The rest of the business saw good gross margin expansion, driven by very strong contributions from our PPI Business System, partially offset by business mix.", "Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 21.2% of revenue, which is 60 basis points favorable to Q3 2016. And R&D expense came in at 4.3% of revenue. R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue was 6.6%, up 50 basis points over Q3 2016.", "Looking at our results below the line. Net interest expense was $132 million, up $29 million from Q3 2016, mainly as a result of our incremental debt related to the capital deployment actions this year. Adjusted other income and expense was net income of $7 million within the quarter, which is $6 million favorable versus Q3 2016, driven primarily by non-operating FX gains.", "Our adjusted tax rate in Q3 was 11.8%, which is 130 basis points lower than last year, due to our tax planning activities and the impact of Patheon. The timing of discrete tax planning actions within Q3 and Q4 of 2017 is different versus our previous guidance. As a result, the Q3 tax rate is slightly lower than previously expected and the Q4 tax rate will be slightly higher, with no net impact expected on the year due to the shift in timing.", "And average diluted shares were 399.6 million, up 2.2 million year over year, due to the completion of the recent equity offering and option dilution, partially offset by previous share buybacks.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet, cash flow from continuing operations for the first nine months of the year was $2.15 billion, and free cash flow was $1.85 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of $290 million. Free cash flow is $85 million higher than the same period of last year and includes approximately $200 million of one-time cash payments related to the Patheon acquisition.", "We ended the quarter with $745 million in cash and investments. And similar to previous quarters, we paid $60 million of dividends in Q3.", "Our total debt at the end of Q3 was $22 billion, up $5.2 billion sequentially from Q2, as a result of the financing related to the Patheon acquisition. Our leverage ratio at the end of the quarter was 4.4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA on a reported basis and 4.1 times on a pro forma basis, which is in line with our expectations.", "And wrapping up my comments on our total company performance, our trailing 12 months adjusted ROIC was 9.8%, flat versus prior year. This represents approximately 100 basis points of operational improvement over Q3 2016, in line with our expectations.", "Now let me give you some color on the revenue and operational performance of our four business segments. Starting with the Life Sciences Solutions segment, reported revenue grew 5% and organic revenue increased 4% in Q3.", "Our Biosciences business delivered another strong quarter of growth. Q3 adjusted operating income in the segment increased 17%, and adjusted operating margin grew 320 basis points year over year to 32.8%. In the quarter, we saw very strong productivity, volume pull-through, and positive business mix, partially offset by strategic investments.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 32% in Q3 and organic revenue growth was 11%. This segment includes our FEI electron microscopy product line, which is part of our materials science business. In the quarter, we had strong growth in our chromatography and mass spec and our materials science businesses. We also continued to see growth in our chemical analysis business.", "Q3 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments grew 35% and adjusted operating margin was 21.6%, up 40 basis points year over year. In the quarter, adjusted operating margin benefited from our PPI Business System, volume pull-through, and acquisitions, partially offset by strategic investments and foreign exchange.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment, in Q3 revenue grew 6% and organic revenue growth was 4%. We saw good organic growth contributions from all of our businesses in the segment in Q3, with particularly strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and transplant diagnostics businesses. Adjusted operating income increased 2% in Q3 and adjusted operating margin was 25.9%, which represents a contraction of 90 basis points from Q3 of the prior year. Adjusted operating margin was positively affected by volume and productivity. However, this was more than offset by strategic investments and business mix.", "Finally in the Laboratory Products and Services segment, which now includes the Patheon acquisition, Q3 reported revenue increased 15%, and organic revenue growth was 3%. Our channel business once again delivered strong growth in the quarter. Adjusted operating income in this segment increased 1%, and adjusted operating margin was 12.6%, down 170 basis points from the prior year.", "Adjusted operating margin benefited from strong productivity and volume leverage. However, as expected, this was more than offset by the impact of unfavorable business mix, driven by our clinical trials business and by strategic investments. As a reminder, the clinical trials business was affected by the discontinuation of a large Phase 3 clinical trial in late 2016, and the impact will sunset by the end of Q4.", "With that, I'll now move on to our full-year 2017 guidance. As you saw in our press release, we are raising the revenue and adjusted earnings per share guidance. Let me walk you through the details, starting with revenue.", "The midpoint of our revenue guidance is increasing $780 million to reflect $670 million from Patheon, an $80 million improvement in foreign exchange, and a $25 million increase in organic revenue as a result of our operating performance in Q3. The full-year organic growth outlook is therefore $25 million higher than our previous guidance, but it did not change the ramp for the full year, so we still expect 4% organic growth for 2017.", "On adjusted earnings per share, we're increasing the midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance by $0.12. This includes $0.05 impact from Patheon, $0.04 improved operational performance, and $0.03 from a less adverse FX environment.", "And finally, with three quarters of strong operational performance behind us, we're narrowing our revenue guidance range to $160 million and narrowing our adjusted earnings per share range to $0.09.", "As Mark mentioned, Hurricane Maria caused widespread damage to Puerto Rico last month, and our thoughts and prayers are with the people affected. We have three operational sites on the island. The largest, the legacy Patheon site, is still offline. We're working with our customers to get that site back online as soon as possible. We currently estimate the impact of the site being offline to be approximately $0.05 of adjusted earnings per share, and that is factored into the guidance I just outlined.", "So despite this headwind, we're still able to increase guidance at the midpoint by $0.12, which indicates that we're executing very well.", "To sum up the guidance changes, the increased 2017 revenue guidance is now a range of $20.5 billion to $20.66 billion, which would represent 12% to 13% growth versus 2016. We expect acquisitions to contribute just under 9% to our reported revenue growth in 2017, and FX is expected to be a year-over-year headwind of $10 million, a negligible impact on growth.", "In terms of adjusted earnings per share, our increased 2017 guidance is now a range of $9.29 to $9.38, with a midpoint of $9.335. This represents growth of 12% to 13% versus 2016. We now expect a headwind from foreign exchange of $0.12 for the year. Excluding the impact of FX, this would represent adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% to 15%.", "A few other details behind the revised 2017 guidance; as I mentioned earlier, Patheon's margin profile is lower than the average for the company, so it will be dilutive to the overall operating margins for the first 12 months. Our revised guidance now assumes that we will deliver 20 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion in 2017. Excluding Patheon, the revised guidance is 60 basis points expansion, which is slightly higher than our previous guidance.", "Net interest expense has increased $30 million from our previous guidance to $510 million as a result of the financing of the Patheon acquisition. And we're forecasting our adjusted income tax rate to be 13% for the year, which is a 30 basis points reduction from our previous guidance due to the positive impact of the Patheon acquisition.", "We've completed $750 million of share buybacks this year, all in the first half. And at this point, we do not expect any additional buybacks in 2017. We continue to assume we'll return approximately $240 million of capital to shareholders through dividends in 2017. Our guidance does not include any future acquisitions or divestitures, and full-year average diluted shares are now estimated to be 398 million, which is a 4 million increase from the previous guidance due to the completion of a recent equity offering. Q4 average diluted shares are estimated to be 404.5 million.", "We're assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $500 million, no change from the previous guidance. And with respect to free cash flow, as I mentioned earlier, we've incurred approximately $200 million of one-time cash payments related to the Patheon acquisition. This is being offset by improved operational cash flow, including a small benefit from the Patheon business. So we continue to expect to generate about $3.15 billion of free cash flow for 2017. As always, in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see results playing out.", "So in summary, we delivered three strong quarters of operational performance, flowed through the benefit of a more favorable FX environment, and executed really well on our capital deployment strategy. All of this keeps us well on track to deliver an excellent 2017.", "With that, I'll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you, Stephen. Operator, we're ready to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin, Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So a couple of questions. So the 11% organic number in Analytical Instruments, what was the FEI contribution to that?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Derik, in terms of Analytical Instruments, we had very strong performance from our chromatography and mass spectrometry business. It's good to see chemical analysis also return to growth. FEI had strong double-digit growth in the quarter. Obviously, it was a partial quarter impact just given the anniversary, but obviously, electron microscopy also contributed to the strong growth.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And so staying on the Analytical Instruments side, and this is a question for both your industrial and your pharma customers, as we talk about increasing interest in tax reform in the U.S. and there's talking about immediate expensing of capital, are you seeing any potential hesitation in terms of people looking to spend in Q4? The question on the budget flushing, thinking about if people think tax reform is coming, would they push instrumentation spending off into next year?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "If I think about what's happened in industrial and applied end markets, we saw real strength in Asia-Pacific. The U.S. has been pretty consistent. Customers really haven't talked much about sitting on the sidelines because of potential tax regulations. So I think the U.S. has not been strong with industrial. It's been slowly recovering. So I don't think we're expecting a big factor one way or the other from U.S. tax policy on demand.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great, and I'll get back in the queue.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thank you, Derik.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Derik.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks, great quarter. Marc, I want to maybe follow up on that questioning on FEI. I'm curious how much of the growth is coming on the semi side versus Cryo-EM uptake. And then with the new systems, is this reflecting some strong early interest on the pharma side? It seems like the new platforms are geared toward drug development.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Tycho, thanks for the question. When I think about how the FEI business has performed, given that it's just past the one-year anniversary, it's a good time to reflect on what's happened.", "I think at the highest level, the business has benefited tremendously from our integration approach, right? Our PPI Business System has helped them expand capacity. And our business management system, part of PPI, ruthless prioritization on the most important things has allowed both the materials sciences businesses and the life sciences businesses to really significantly accelerate growth over anything the business has delivered over the last number of years, and the team has done a fabulous job of executing.", "When I think about the two end markets, materials sciences is in a strong part of the cycle. That's both industrial and semiconductor customers. Semiconductor has been very strong, but we've also seen a nice acceleration in our life sciences customers as well as strong bookings growth as well. So the businesses are performing well across all fronts. The new products are geared towards both the nano material research on the materials science side. And on the life sciences side, we are getting some level of interest from biotech and pharma customers, although it's still a bit early, but the feedback has been positive.", "When you summarize the whole story on FEI, I think the way I would characterize it, performance has been so strong that relative to the underwriting case that we talked about when we announced the deal on the call a little over a year ago, we're going to meet our ROIC hurdle a full year earlier than what we articulated back then. So it's been a great acquisition, off to a great start, and we're going to fully capitalize on the opportunities ahead.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks. And then a follow-up, I'm just curious on your comments on bioprocess. There's a fair amount of noise in that market now with biosimilars and some of the drug companies working down inventory at both the supplier and the manufacturer. You see both sides of it. I was just curious \u2013 your comments on the outlook for that market, I know it slowed a little bit last quarter. That was more timing on the supplier side, but I was curious how you see the outlook there.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Tycho, in terms of bioproduction, we had moderate growth, very similar to what we saw in Q2. We continue to see very strong early indicators that really showed up in the biosciences business for cell culture media and sera as well as in the smaller biotech demand for our clinical trials activity. So the early indicators, leading indicators are very strong, and conditions were similar to what we saw in Q2 with moderate growth.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Tycho.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Good morning and thanks for the time here, everyone. First question is actually on the fourth quarter, the implied fourth quarter expectations. It would be really helpful if you could try to frame up for us, quantify for us what you think the bottom line impact in the fourth quarter would be from Patheon specifically and from any lingering impacts from the situation in Puerto Rico or the natural disasters, more specifically top/bottom line. Whatever you have on hand would be very, very helpful. Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So I'll do a little bit of it and then Stephen will give maybe a more comprehensive view. In terms of the fourth quarter, other than bringing our Manati, Puerto Rico site back online, we're not expecting really any impact from weather. So what you would see from that in the fourth quarter is embedded in our guidance of about a $0.05 headwind, probably a little bit we got at the end of the third quarter, but a $0.05 headwind in Manati based on just getting the operation back online. And, Stephen, you might want to discuss some puts and takes.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, so just some additional color. So the $675 million of revenue for Patheon that we've added to guidance, $190 million of that was recognized in Q3. And then in terms of Q4 for the net accretion, including the impact of the Puerto Rico issue for that site, it's still $0.02 additional accretion in that $0.12 change that I gave you at the midpoint.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, got it. I really appreciate that. And then, Marc, it's always really helpful to hear how you're thinking about a couple of things going forward. I think one is it's very helpful to hear how you think what the critical factors outside the company's control are with regard to where the trajectory of the business is within the 4-to-6 framework. And then maybe a subcategory of that framework is always the NIH, not necessarily budgets but more disbursements, and then I'll get back in queue. Thanks so much.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks for the question. So the company is performing extremely well. When I think about the quarter, 5% organic growth. When I think about the end markets, we saw improved performance and really strong execution, both academic and government and industrial, applied, very, very positive.", "When I think about the outlook for Q4, basically we've raised our outlook for organic growth based on the Q3 performance. We've maintained for the fourth quarter the same level of organic growth that we assumed back in July. And the reason we did that is there's always a range of outcomes on what year-end spend is, and we're obviously going to drive to the highest possible number.", "So I think in the fourth quarter, the things we look at is where does FX rates finally settling at, and ultimately what's the level of year-end spend. And as you look back over many years past, we'll do a good job of capitalizing on all the market opportunities out there and creating some new ones as well.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks so much.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Doug.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "You increased full-year organic growth revenue expectations by $25 million. This is about the magnitude of the Q3 beat. It seems like you have stronger than expected FEI momentum. AI grew I think around 6% the last six months with no signs of slowing momentum. And Specialty Diagnostics growth is actually improving to levels that we haven't seen in a little while, just to name a few observations. Your guidance doesn't seem to reflect a continuation of improving momentum. Could you just speak to why that might be?", "And then I guess relatedly, is some of this weather, and would you be willing to quantify specifically what you believe the impact of weather was in the third quarter?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Doug, in terms of the fourth quarter, a couple points, the first of which is we were very comfortable banking everything we delivered versus our expectations organically in Q3 and then subsequently raising the guidance. We chose to keep the Q4 number the same as it is because, as you know, it's the one with the widest level of variation based on year-end spend, and we've assumed year-end spend to be exactly the same level as last year. So we believe that the range of outcomes has the possibility for better performance. So I think that's one way to think about it.", "I think the other way is, just when you go through the numbers, we have a more challenging comparison in our electron microscopy business in the fourth quarter. So it will be above the company average and we're very confident of that, but the contribution might be a little bit smaller in Q4 than what we saw in Q3.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And the...", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Are you talking about weather?", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "The weather impact.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Weather here just in terms of customer demand in Q3 was probably about 0.5 point of impact.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And the expectation is some of that lingers into Q4.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Not a material amount.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, and just one more follow-up. I know Tycho asked the earlier question on bioproduction. I apologize if I missed it in his answer, but when do you expect that to pick up a little bit more with the bioproduction revenue trend? And specifically on destocking, which is what we've heard from a few of your peers, have you seen any impact from destocking in that part of your business?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Probably from our company perspective, it's better to give the pharma and biotech as an end market. And when I look at that, obviously, solid mid-single-digit growth in the quarter, real strength in the research applications. Bioproduction had moderate growth. It was a little bit slower, but still a good contributor.", "We saw some of our customers managing their inventory. Really with the advent of biosimilars becoming more important, I think customers are just managing inventory in a more prudent fashion. But the pipeline of new molecules is quite promising, and it will take some time to ramp up. So we're very, very bullish on the long-term prospects of bioproduction. We're very bullish on our competitive position across pharma and biotech, and it continues to be a great end market for us.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you for all that. Have a good day.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Dan Arias of Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks, maybe just two on FEI. Stephen, on the top line, I'm just curious how much of the organic growth that you're seeing is actually falling through versus being reinvested. And then along those lines, we're coming into year-one accretion that's more like $0.40 than $0.30. And so is that right? I'm just wondering maybe if you have a view on year-two accretion or synergies given where the performance is.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Sorry, can you just clarify the first question? I didn't get it, sorry.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "I'm just trying to understand how much within that business you're actually letting through to the bottom line. And then on accretion, for the year-one target that you had of $0.30, we're looking at more like $0.40. I'm just looking to see if that was right.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, so we're appropriately investing in that business for the long term. And you see that, the results of that in the new products that have being introduced this quarter. But we're also printing very good EPS from the high growth that we're seeing this year.", "As you look at the first 12 months of this acquisition, as you said, we outlined $0.30 back at the beginning of the deal, and I think the actual number was $0.43, so very strong contribution from the acquisitions. And a significant amount of that was basically the base business revenue being higher. The synergies are running a little bit ahead. Probably $0.01 \u2013 about $0.02 of that beat was synergy-related. The rest was really from the base revenue.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then Marc had highlighted the new products that you've launched there recently. So I guess as we think about the gross margins for the AI business, I'm just curious whether you think that segment can benefit from an improving profile there. Prior to the deal, those guys had emphasized better gross margins on the newer instruments that were being launched. So I'm just curious if you think that's something that's meaningful at all going forward.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, I think you'll continue to see gross margins expand, and certainly in the electron microscopy business just given the mix over time. The life sciences business a number of years ago was a lower-margin business for legacy FEI. And through our PPI Business System as well as our commitment to innovation, those products are increasing their margins. The materials science applications are, of course, still higher margins. They're a more fully established set of products. So mix matters within the business, but in the underlying pieces, margins are expanding in both.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "And just one other factor, the life sciences side of the businesses, the service stream for that is really ramping up. And that's slightly \u2013 that delays from the ramp-up in the instrument placements. So that will also help gross margins as we go out the next couple of years.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Super. Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Meehan of Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good morning.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Jack.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I have two biopharma questions. So I wanted to start with Patheon. So now that you've owned the acquisition for about two months, just talk about conviction in the revenue synergy's long-term trajectory there. And near term, if I think about the implied fourth quarter from Stephen's guidance, I think it's down a little bit year over year, maybe just how you think that turns going into 2018.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "In terms of the fourth quarter guidance, we're actually quite bullish on what the outlook is for the business. The end markets actually look good. So it is obviously \u2013 roughly around the 4% range would be what's implied based on the July guidance. And as we've talked, there's obviously a range of outcomes, with a good year-end finish could drive that higher. So that's the way to think about it.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "But one additional factor is, Jack, is that we have deferred revenue accounting adjustments at the beginning of the transaction, and it's fairly sizable for this deal. It's about $20 million of impact on revenue and profitability in Q4 for the Patheon transaction.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So we feel good about Q4. From that perspective, everything looks strong and solid. So I don't think there's much there.", "In terms of going into 2018, looking at the end markets, we'll obviously give the more holistic view for the year when we get on to the January call. But based on what's going on in Washington, we're expecting a budget to get into place with NIH growth towards the end of this year, which would set up as a positive for next year.", "Obviously, in industrial and applied, at the beginning of this year we're talking about a recovery, and obviously we're seeing good growth there. And pharma and biotech has been solid throughout the year. So at least as we see the world right now, we're entering 2018 with a lot of really good things going on. So I feel good about how the team is executing.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great, that makes sense. And then I just wanted to nitpick the trends in Lab Products and Services a little bit, sequentially 3% growth, but a little bit softer. I think your overlapped the clinical trial logistics in the fourth quarter, but maybe just talk about the trends there and what we should think about comp-wise in 4Q.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So sequentially, really the impact is weather. It was fairly concentrated in that segment, so it was about a percentage of growth for the segment. That's really the sequential change. And then the clinical trial, we will sunset that by the end of Q4. There's still some run-over revenue that were lapping in Q4. We'd probably be done with that by the end of the year.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, Stephen.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Patrick Donnelly of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thanks, maybe one for Marc. Just on Patheon, I know it's early, but how are things compared to your expectations when it comes to utilization levels at the facilities? It feels like cost synergies are going to be driven more by improved efficiency there rather than facility consolidation. So I just wanted to hear your general thoughts now that you've had a chance to see them from the inside.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Patrick, great question. So I've had a chance to visit a number of the sites and meet with all the general managers of each of the sites and all the quality leaders. It's a really strong team. There's plenty of capacity to be leveraged, right? So what's exciting about the Patheon business is that it really is about driving operational efficiency and then leveraging our commercial reach to further fill up the plants. So incremental volumes really does flow through at an attractive rate. So driving the top line here is going to be a key driver, and our PPI Business System is going to help drive further benefits within the plants.", "Some of the cost synergies, obviously, is duplicative corporate costs and things of that sort. So you get those right away, and that flows quickly. And as we continue to drive volume growth, you'll see it flow through at an attractive rate. So it's early days but very, very encouraging, and we're looking forward to really leveraging our commercial infrastructure because the customer feedback has been great about the combination. So we're very bullish. It's early, but very bullish at this point.", "Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Okay. And then on industrial, I know in past quarters you talked about core industrial orders trending up a little bit in the U.S. and showing signs of life, and the hope was revenue would follow suit in the back half. Could you just talk about an update on the market there and how you feel?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Yes, so mid-single-digit growth in industrial, another quarter of growth in our chemical analysis business, really strong Analytical Instruments performance across chrome, mass spec, electron microscopy, environmental instruments, so good demand there. Asia-Pacific was very strong. The U.S. is growing but it's growing moderately. So that obviously still hasn't fully benefited from the recovery, but we're definitely seeing real strength in Asia.", "So pretty encouraging in terms of where industrial and applied is. And the applied markets continue to be very, very positive. And certainly, we saw that in our environmental instruments, and we just launched a new air monitor and that makes a difference for that marketplace as well. So really a much better part of the cycle than we've been reporting over the last couple of years.", "Patrick Donnelly - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Paul Knight of Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hi, Marc. Can you talk about NIH, what you're seeing there? And then the second question I have is Europe has been better. Why do you think Europe is better?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So, Paul, thanks for the question. So in terms of academic and government, it was really good to see mid-single-digit growth globally. That's a very strong quarter. North America was consistent with the last few quarters with modest growth, and we're expecting an NIH budget to show an increase of $1 billion to $2 billion ultimately, and that should continue momentum into 2018 as well. So generally, conditions here in the U.S. are stable and growing modestly.", "Europe was very good, right? So we saw that across a variety of our instrument offerings. In particular, Germany was releasing funds, which was good, but we saw broad-based demand from a number of countries. So I think getting back to a more stable, growing European economy, you're seeing governments invest in academic and research, and that was a real positive in the quarter. And it was great to translate it into our whole business, which grew mid-single digits in Europe. So it's very encouraging.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then lastly, FEI, obviously a good quarter. How do you view that business in terms of predictability? It still has semiconductor exposure. Is there backlog, is there orders? What's your visibility on FEI going forward?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "So orders grew strongly in the quarter. We have a very strong backlog and good visibility for the business. The life sciences business, you can think of it as a rapidly growing business, and therefore it's not really subject to the economic cycles as much.", "The materials science business does have a cyclical nature to it. It's in a really very positive part of the cycle. And as we read, certainly for the next quarter, that's very strong. The next year's comparison will be more challenging just given how strong the growth was this year, but we're very positive on the outlook for the electron microscopy business.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Steve Willoughby of Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Most of them have been asked already. Just one question for you, Marc, on your AI business on LC and mass spec. I'm just wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what you see going on there as it relates to the strength you're seeing. Is it your new products? Is it underlying market growth? Is it potential share gains in some of those markets? Just any more color there would be helpful.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "When I look at the chrome and mass spec growth that we've delivered for a number of quarters relative to what we can see from the external market, we've been gaining share, meaning we're growing faster than the others that are reporting the numbers. And as you recall, when you look at the growth, up until the last quarter or two, the chemical analysis business, which is not a mass spec business, had been declining. So when you looked at the segment, it looked like moderate growth, but underlying that was strong mass spectrometry growth.", "The reasons for that I think are twofold. One of the things is, as you advance technologies, it opens up new desire for the leading researchers to buy the products. So we continue to innovate, and therefore the funding cycle actually follows that innovation. So as long as the industry is bringing out relevant new products, these best researchers get the money. So the funding environment has been good.", "And ASMS was a great conference for us this year back in June, and it's rare that I highlight the quarter after product launches how well received they are, but our two triple-quads and our new Q Exactive really are off to a fantastic start. So it's a good market and really solid execution for share gain has been what's driving that.", "Stephen Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay, thanks very much.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Catherine Schulte of Baird. Your line is open.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "I was just thinking into the Analytical Instruments growth a little bit more. I'm wondering if you could walk it through by either end market or geography. I'm just trying to get a better sense of what was unique in this quarter to get to that 11% number.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "I think probably it's more the macro of chemical analysis growing versus being a headwind because they had been shirking for several years. It's been a couple quarters of growth. So that really makes a big difference. Even though it's moderate growth, it really does matter because chrome and mass spec has done well. And then we got some benefit from electron microscopy, which had a very strong quarter. So that combination really was the big driver.", "In terms of geography, the one area I would call out as being just very strong was Asia-Pacific. It was very good across all segments for our Analytical Instruments markets.", "Stephen Williamson - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "And just as a reminder, the electron microscopy is currently showing up in industrial and applied and academic and government, where the concentration of revenue is.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just quickly on companion diagnostics, you have a number of FDA approvals under your belt and now starting to get some reimbursement. How big of a business do you think that could be in 2018?", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "When I think about the programs in companion diagnostics, we are getting our lab partners up and running on our Oncomine Target DX companion diagnostic. LabCorp was up and running; more will get online. So that business will build throughout the fourth quarter and into 2018. As you know, the entire next-gen sequencing business is less than 2% of our total revenue. So it's not a huge business, but certainly the oncology portion is encouraging in terms of the actions going there.", "Catherine Ramsey Schulte - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.", "Great, thank you.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Kenneth J. Apicerno - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Operator, we're going to take just one more.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, my questions have been answered.", "Marc N. Casper - Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.", "Great, Derik, thanks. So let me wrap it up. First of all, when I think about where we are at this point in the year, we're really in a great position to finish the year strongly, and I look forward to reporting a successful 2017 in January. Of course, thank you for your support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Thanks, everyone. Have a good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "I would like to introduce our moderator for the call, Mr. Kenneth Apicerno, Vice President, Investor Relations. Mr. Apicerno, you may begin you call.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Good morning and thank you for joining us. On the call with me today is Marc Casper, our President and Chief Executive Officer, and Stephen Williamson, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.", "Please note, this call is being webcast live and will be archived on the Investors section of our website, thermofisher.com, under the heading Webcasts & Presentations, until February 16, 2018. A copy of the press release of our fourth quarter 2017 earnings and future expectations is available in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Results.", "So, before we begin, let me briefly cover our Safe Harbor statement.

A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available in the press release of our fourth quarter 2017 earnings and future expectations and also in the Investors section of our website under the heading Financial Information.", "So, with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Marc.", "Marc Casper", "Thank you, Ken. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today for our 2017 Q4 call.", "As you saw in our press release, we delivered an outstanding year. We achieved strong growth in revenues and earnings; we executed well to take advantage of good conditions across our end-markets; and we became a stronger partner for our customers by successfully executing our growth strategy and completing strategic M&A. The excellent progress we made in 2017 has significantly strengthened our leadership position and sets up very well for the year ahead. We have a lot to cover this morning. So, I will hit just some of the highlights from the quarter and the year.", "Let me begin with our financial performance, starting with the quarter. We delivered very strong adjusted earnings per share growth in Q4 with a 16% increase to $2.79 per share. Our revenue in the quarter increased 22% year-over-year to $6.05 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 18% to $1.45 billion and our adjusted operating margin in Q4 was 24%. ", "Turing to our result for the full year. We extended our long track record of consistently delivering strong earnings performance in 2017 with a 15% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $9.49 per share. We increased revenues by 14% for the full year to $20.92 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 15% to $4.86 billion with adjusted operating margin of 23.2%.", "So, it was a great year. Our team did an excellent job of driving our growth initiatives forward and successfully completing and integrating new acquisitions. As a result of their efforts, we\u2019re in a stronger position to serve our customers, provide opportunities for our collogues and create value for our shareholders.", "Turning to our performance by end market. Conditions were strong and we executed very well to take advantage of our growth opportunities. I will give you some specific commentary on the quarter and a little additional color on our results for the year.", "Starting with pharma and biotech. We delivered strong growth in Q4 across all of our businesses that serve these customers including good contributions from our bioproduction and clinical trials businesses. This resulted in 10% growth for the quarter in this end market. We continue to capitalize on the underlying strength of pharma and biotech and the deep relationships we\u2019ve built over time to deliver our unique value proposition for these customers. Our leading position in this end market, led to high single digit growth for the year.", "In academic and government, we grew in the high single digits during the quarter. Geographically, we performed well across our key regions; and from a product perspective, we saw a strong demand for our mass spectrometry and electron microscopy systems. For the full year, we delivered mid single digit growth in this end market.", "In diagnostics and health care, we were pleased to deliver a very good quarter with high single digit growth. Our performance in this end market was driven primarily by strength in our seasonal businesses as well as good demand for our biomarker tests. For the full year, our growth here was in the low single digits.", "Last, in industrial and applied, we achieved mid single digit growth for the quarter and the year. In Q4, we saw strength across our various businesses serving this customer base. In particular, it was great to see continued good growth in our chemical analysis business.", "So, to summarize our performance. Good market conditions across the board and great execution by our teams led to strong growth for the year.", "Now, let me shift gears to talk about our accomplishments in the context of our growth strategy, which is based on our ability to continuously develop high impact, innovative new products, leverage our scale in emerging markets and deliver a unique value proposition to our customers.", "I\u2019m pleased with the excellent progress we made in 2017 in all three elements of our strategy. Starting with innovation. This is one of our core values as a Company, and we invested about $900 million in R&D, in 2017. We had a number of milestones during the year across all of our key technology platforms, and I am going to cover some of the highlights.", "First, the mass spectrometry. We continued to build on the long-term success of our Orbitrap platform by launching the Thermo Scientific Q Exactive HF-X system for life sciences research. We also expanded our offering for applied markets for the new triple-stage quadrupole instruments.", "Turning to electron microscopy. It\u2019s been a little over year since we acquired FEI, and we launched a number of new products since then, among the highlights for material science applications, we expanded our Thermo Scientific Helios G4 DualBeam platform and for structural biology, new systems such as our Thermo Scientific Krios G3i are helping us to increase our presence in that fast-growing market.", "You may recall that the winners of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Chemistry achieved breakthrough developments in structural biology using our cryo-EM technologies. This is a terrific business that we continue to make even stronger through our leading presence in pharma and biotech.", "In Specialty Diagnostics, we launched a number of new assays during the year. This included receiving FDA clearance to expand the use of our BRAHMS PCT test as a biomarker for bacterial infection, helping doctors to make better decisions regarding the use of antibiotics.", "We have a number of highlights in our genetic analysis business as well and the most significant was our new Applied Biosystems SeqStudio instrument for Sanger sequencing. This cloud-enabled system was designed for simplicity and affordability to serve customers working in low to mid throughput laboratories. Especially exciting were two new cancer treatment breakthroughs that in 2017 were enabled through our innovations. One was the first FDA-approved companion diagnostic for non-small cell lung cancer using our NGS-based Oncomine Dx Target Test; another was the first FDA-approved CAR-T immunotherapy for treating a specific form of childhood leukemia which use our Dynabeads technology. These are both examples of our significant contributions towards advancing precision medicine which will continue to be a priority for us going forward.", "Turning to the second element of our growth strategy. We continue to leverage our scale to drive growth in emerging markets. As of year-end these high-growth regions represent 21% of our total revenue. China, India, and South Korea all delivered strong growth. China grew in the high teens once again in 2017, and remains a key growth market for us, constituting about 10% of our total revenue today. We continue to fuel the long-term growth in China through targeted investments. And during the year, we opened two new customer demo centers that showcased our leadership in electron microscopy and precision medicine. These new capabilities are helping us to capitalize on the priorities outlined in China\u2019s five-year plan. We\u2019ve also invested significantly in our digital capabilities and are pleased that our ecommerce revenues in China grew 50% in 2017. In addition to China, we\u2019ve continued to increase our scale and depth of capabilities across emerging markets from India to the Middle East to Southeast Asia.", "Turning to our customer value proposition which is the third element of our growth strategy. We invested significantly to enhance our offering through a number of strategic acquisitions during the year. In Q4, we completed two small bolt-on acquisitions that expand our air quality monitoring and scanning electron microscopy platforms.", "As you know, the most significant transaction from 2017 was our acquisition of Patheon, a leading provider of contract development and manufacturing services for pharma and biotech customers. These capabilities are a perfect complement to our leading clinical trials logistics services and allowed us to create a $3 billion pharma services business. We\u2019ve owned Patheon for about five months, the integration is proceeding well, and we\u2019re on track to achieve our cost and revenue synergy targets for year one. I recently met with our sales team in this business to help them kick off the year. They\u2019re super excited about the opportunities they have as part of Thermo Fisher and I believe their enthusiasm is a reflection of what they\u2019re hearing directly from our pharma and biotech customers.", "I\u2019d also like to update you on the Patheon site in Puerto Rico that was impacted by the damage to the island\u2019s power infrastructure after the hurricane. Our teams there really stepped up, and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of the way they responded, making sure all of their colleagues were safe and getting the facility back on line to help our customers deliver critical medicines to patients. The site began shipping in late Q4 and was fully operational as we entered 2018.", "Turning to capital deployment, 2017 was another very active year for us. All told, we deployed $7.8 billion on M&A to expand our customer offering and strengthen the strategic position of Thermo Fisher. Looking forward, we continue to have a very active M&A pipeline. We\u2019re focused on paying down debt and we\u2019re committed to driving high returns from the investments we\u2019ve made.", "We also returned $1 billion of capital to our shareholders in 2017 through stock buybacks and dividends. As we said in the past, we intend to grow our dividend over time. And this morning, we announced that we increased our dividend by 13%. Returning capital remains an important part of our overall capital deployment strategy.", "Before I wrap up, let me make a quick comment on the other announcement we made this morning. As you know, the new tax law is a real positive for Thermo Fisher and will further lower our tax rate. We\u2019ve decided to reinvest some of the benefit in our colleagues, customers and communities.", "In 2017, we invested $34 million of the tax benefit by paying a one-time bonus to all of our non-executive colleagues around the world as a way to thank them for their commitment to our success. In 2018, we\u2019ll invest $16 million to accelerate breakthrough R&D programs and also to increase the impact of our STEM education and sustainability activities. We\u2019re pleased to take advantage of this unique opportunity to complement our ongoing investments in Thermo Fisher\u2019s future growth.", "So to summarize, our strong Q4 really capped off a great year. Our teams executed very well to deliver strong revenue and earnings growth. We strengthened our leadership by advancing our growth strategy and continuing to gain share. We also continued to successfully execute our M&A strategy to create significant value for our customers and our shareholders.", "Looking ahead, as you\u2019d expect, we\u2019re planning to extend our long track record of consistent, strong financial performance in 2018. Stephen will outline the assumptions that factor into our revenue and earnings guidance, but let me quickly hit the highlights.", "In terms of our revenue, we expect to deliver from $23.42 billion to $23.72 billion in 2018 which would result in 12% to 13% growth over 2017. We\u2019re initiating adjusted EPS guidance for 2018 in the range of $10.68 to $10.88 per share. This would lead to 13% to 15% growth over the strong adjusted EPS performance we delivered this past year. Our excellent result in 2017 really sets us up for another successful year ahead.", "With that, I will turn the call over to our CFO, Stephen Williamson. Stephen?", "Stephen Williamson", "Thanks, Marc, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll take you through our fourth quarter and full year results of the total Company, then, I\u2019ll provide some color on our four segments, and conclude with a detailed review of our 2018 guidance.", "Before I get into the details of our financial performance, I thought it would be helpful to provide a high level view of how the fourth quarter played out versus our expectations at the time of our last earnings call. As you saw in our press release, we had a strong finish to the year and delivered 8% organic growth in Q4. This was driven by good market conditions and great operational execution.", "From an earning stand point, we delivered adjusted earnings per share that was $0.15 higher than the midpoint of our previous guidance. This was driven by pull-through on our organic growth and more favorable FX environment, and good performance from the Patheon acquisition, partially offset by the $34 million onetime bonus for our non-executive collogues across the Company that Marc highlighted. So, for the year as a whole, we delivered 5% organic growth, 15% growth in adjusted earnings per share and $3.5 billion of free cash flow. So, overall, excellent financial results in 2017.", "So, now, let me give you more color on our performance. Starting with adjusted earnings per share. As you saw in our press release, we grew adjusted EPS in Q4 by 16% to $2.79. For the full year, adjusted EPS was $9.49, up 15% versus 2016. As you know, U.S. tax reform legislation was enacted during the quarter. And as we expected, it will have a positive impact on the Company. I will cover the 2018 impact in detail in the guidance section of my comments later on. The impact of the legislation on Q4 2017 was a onetime GAAP only charge of $204 million. This represents the transition tax on deemed repatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by the remeasurement impact of U.S. deferred tax balances at the new lower corporate tax rates. As a result, GAAP EPS in the quarter was $1.30, down 18% from Q4 last year and for the full year 2017 was $5.59, up 10% versus 2016.", "On the top-line, in Q4, our reported revenue increased 22% year-over-year. The components of our Q4 revenue included 8% organic growth and 11% impact of acquisitions and the 3% tailwind from foreign exchange. For the full year, 2017 reported revenue increased 14% year-over-year. The 2017 reported revenue includes 5% organic growth and 9% impact from acquisitions and an immaterial impact from foreign exchange.", "Looking at our growth by geography in Q4. North America grew in the high single digits, Europe grew mid single digits, Asia Pacific grew in the low teens with another strong contribution from China which grew in the high teens, and the rest of the world grew in the low teens. For the full year, all geographies grew in the mid single digits except for Asia Pacific, which grew 10%.", "Turning to our operational performance. Q4 adjusted operating income increased 18% and adjusted operating margin was 24%, down 80 basis points from Q4 of last year. As a reminder, Patheon is a scale acquisition with gross margins and operating income margins lower than our Company average and was just over 80 basis points dilutive to total adjusted operating margins in the quarter. The addition of Patheon will continue to be dilutive to our adjusted operating margins over the first 12 months of ownership.", "The one-time bonus payments to our non-executive colleagues was a cost in Q4 2017 and was dilutive to adjusted operating margins by 70 basis points in the quarter. So, our underlying operational performance was strong in the quarter at 70 basis points of expansion, driven by very good volume pull-through and productivity, partially offset by strategic investments and unfavorable business mix. For the full year, adjusted operating income increased 15% and adjusted operating margin was 23.2%, up 10 basis points from 2016, in line with our expectations.", "Moving on to the details of the P&L. Total Company adjusted gross margin came in at 47% in the quarter, down 240 basis points from the prior year. For the full year, adjusted gross margin was 48.2%, down 60 basis points from 2016. For both the quarter and the full year, gross margin contraction was driven by the dilutive impact of acquisitions and unfavorable business mix; this was partially offset by strong productivity.", "Adjusted SG&A in the quarter was 19.2% of revenue, which is down a 110 basis points versus Q4 of 2016, and R&D expense came in at 3.9% of revenue, down 40 basis points versus Q4 of last year. For the full year, adjusted SG&A was 20.7%, down 90 basis points compared to full year 2016, and R&D expense was 4.2% of sales, up 10 basis points compared to the prior year, and R&D as a percent of our manufacturing revenue for the year was 6.6%.", "Looking at our results below the line. The net interest expense in Q4 was $146 million, which is $29 million higher than Q4 last year, mainly as a result of the incremental debt related to our capital deployment activities this year. Net interest expense for the full year was $511 million, an increase of $90 million from 2016. Adjusted other income and expense was a net expense in the quarter at $3 million, which is $14 million unfavorable versus Q4 2016, driven primarily by changes in non-operating FX.", "Our adjusted tax rate was 13.3% in the quarter, right in line with our prior guidance; this is a 130 basis-point lower than Q4 2016 due to the timing of discreet tax planning items as well as the impact of Patheon. Our full year adjusted tax rate was 13%, which is 80 basis points lower than full year 2016.", "Q4 average diluted shares were 405 million, slightly higher than our previous guidance of 404.5 million due to slightly higher option dilution. For the full year, average diluted shares were 398 million, up 0.5 million from 2016.", "For the full year, FX was a year-over-year tailwind of $70 million on revenue and immaterial impact on adjusted operating income. Other income had an $11 million FX headwind for the full year, resulting in a $0.02 headwind on adjusted EPS from FX in 2017.", "Turning to cash flow and the balance sheet. For the full year, cash flow from continuing operations was $4 billion and free cash flow was $3.5 billion after deducting net capital expenditures of approximately $500 million that is $665 million higher than 2016 and ahead of our previous guidance, primarily due to strong operational performance and effective working capital management.", "During 2017 we continued returning capital to shareholders with $750 million of share buybacks and $240 million in dividends. As Marc mentioned, we successfully deployed capital to strengthen our customer value proposition through strategic acquisitions including Patheon as well as a number of smaller bolt-on acquisitions. All told, our total capital deployment in 2017 was approximately $8.8 billion. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.3 billion in cash, just slightly higher than normal as we were preparing to pay down a $450 million senior note in the first week in January.", "We finished the year with total debt of $21 billion, down $1 billion from the end of Q3, driven by debt pay down during the quarter. Our leverage ratio at the end of the year was 4 times total debt to adjusted EBITDA on a reported basis, which is down from 4.4 times at the end of Q3 and in line with our expectations.", "So, wrapping up my comments, our total Company performance, we continued to drive strong ROIC performance in 2017. Adjusted ROIC at the end of 2017 was 10%; this is up 10 basis points compared to the prior year, demonstrating the strength of our underlying businesses offsetting the impact of a significant capital added from our acquisition activity in 2017.", "So, with that, I\u2019ll now provide you some color on the performance of our four business segments, starting with Life Sciences Solutions segment. Reported revenue increased 11% and organic revenue growth was 8% in Q4. We saw strong growth across the segment, particularly in our bioproduction and biosciences businesses. For the full year, reported revenue increased 8% and organic revenue growth was 6%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Life Sciences Solutions increased 20% and adjusted operating margin was 35.6%, which is 270 basis points higher than Q4 of 2016. Adjusted operating margin expansion was driven by strong productivity as well as volume pull-through and foreign exchange; this was partially offset by strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating margin was 33.1%, an increase of 310 basis points over 2016.", "In the Analytical Instruments segment, reported revenue increased 16% and organic revenue growth was 11% in Q4. In the quarter, we benefited from strong growth contributions across all of our businesses within this segment. For the full year, reported revenue in the segment increased 31% and organic growth was 9%. Q4 adjusted operating income in Analytical Instruments increased 16% and adjusted operating margin was flat year-over-year at 24.5%. In the quarter, we saw a very strong productivity and volume pull-through; this was offset by the impact of strategic investments, foreign exchange and unfavorable business mix. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 38% and adjusted operating margin was 21.3%, 100 basis points higher than 2016.", "Turning to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. In Q4, reported revenue increased 10% and organic revenue growth was 7%. In the quarter, we had strong growth in seasonal products and good performance in our clinical and transplant diagnostics businesses. For the full year, we grew both reported and organic revenue 4%. Adjusted operating income grew 6% in Q4 compared to 2016 and adjusted operating margin was 26.5%, down 70 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin within the quarter benefited from positive contributions of our PPI Business System and volume pull-through; however, this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 2% and adjusted operating margin was 26.7%, down 50 basis points from 2016.", "And finally, I will cover the Laboratory Products and Services segment, which as a reminder, includes the Patheon acquisition. In this segment, Q4 reported revenue increased 43% and organic revenue growth was 9%. Our channel business once again delivered strong organic growth from the quarter and it\u2019s good to see all businesses in this segment growing well, including the clinical trials logistics business. For the full year, reported revenue increased 16% and organic growth was 5%. In Q4, adjusted operating income in the segment increased 28% and adjusted operating margin was 12.5%, down 150 basis points from the prior year. Adjusted operating margin benefited from strong volume pull-through and the accretive impact on the segment from acquisitions; this is more than offset by unfavorable business mix and strategic investments. For the full year 2017, adjusted operating income increased 4% and adjusted operating margin was 12.9%, down 150 basis points compared to the prior year.", "With that, I would like to review the details of our 2018 guidance. As Marc mentioned, we\u2019re initiating a 2018 adjusted EPS guidance range of $10.68 to $10.88, which is a 13% to 15% growth over 2017. In terms of revenue, our guidance range is $23.42 billion to $23.72 billion, which is growth of 12% to 13% over 2017. And for 2018, we\u2019re expecting to deliver between 4% and 5% organic revenue growth.", "Let me now cover the key assumptions that we factored into our guidance. We\u2019re assuming this foreign exchange is a $300 million revenue tailwind to 2018, which should represent a positive impact of just over 1%. This reflects the average of rates over the past two months. We assume that this pull through at approximately 20%, given our current mix of currencies, the addition of Patheon and potential transactional FX. This translates to an EPS tailwind from FX of $0.13 or just over 1%.", "We expect acquisitions completed in 2017 will contribute 7% to our reported revenue growth in 2018. From an adjusted operating margin standpoint, as I mentioned earlier, Patheon\u2019s margin profile is lower than the average of the Company, so it will be dilutive to the overall operating margins until the anniversary date in late August. The impact of this in 2018 is 50 basis points of dilution. Despite this headwind, we\u2019re still expecting to deliver 20 to 30 basis points of expansion year-over-year in 2018, reflecting strong operational performance.", "Moving below the line, we expect net interest expense to be in the range of $550 million to $555 million, about $40 higher than 2017, primarily as a result of the debt we took on for acquisitions in 2017 and assumed rate increases in 2018. For guidance purposes, I\u2019ve assumed that the Fed increases rate 25 basis points per quarter in 2018.", "We\u2019re assuming other income and expense will be an immaterial net expense in 2018. As I mentioned earlier, as expected, the impact of U.S. tax reform is a positive for the company. As a result, in 2018, we\u2019re assuming an adjusted income tax rate of 12%; this compares to 13% for 2017.", "The detailed regulations supporting the new tax law are still being finalized by the U.S. Treasury. But, based on where we anticipate the final wording to land, factoring in our tax planning activities, we expect no cash impact from the transition tax charge that we incurred in Q4 of 2017. And in addition for 2018, we expect cash taxes to be slightly lower than the adjusted P&L tax cost. We\u2019re assuming net capital expenditures to be approximately $700 million to $730 million for the year. The increase over 2017 is due to the timing of projects and the full year impact of Patheon. We anticipate receiving approximately $30 million of customer funding towards this CapEx.", "Free cash flow is expected to be approximately $3.8 billion in 2018; the increase over 2017 is mainly due to higher earnings. And in terms of capital deployment, we\u2019re assuming that we\u2019ll return approximately $275 million of capital to shareholders this year through dividends, reflecting the increase in dividend we announced earlier today. Our guidance also assumes a total of $500 million of share buybacks in 2018, which we assume will be completed during the second half of the year. We estimate that the full year average diluted shares will be in the range of 405 million to 407 million, up approximately 8 million from the average in 2017, primarily due to the equity offering last year. Our guidance assumes that we\u2019ll continue to use excess cash to reduce debt and as always does not assume any future acquisitions or divestitures.", "And finally, I wanted to touch on quarterly phasing for the year. In terms of organic revenue growth, we\u2019re expecting Q2 and Q3 to be slightly higher than the average for the year. This phasing is driven by the timing of holidays in the first half of the year and strong comps in Q4. In terms of adjusted EPS, we\u2019re expecting the same phasing as 2017 when you look at each quarter as a percentage of the total year. And as always in interpreting our revenue and adjusted EPS guidance ranges, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view on how we see the year playing out.", "So, in summary, we delivered excellent financial results in 2017 and look forward to doing the same in 2018. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Ken.", "Kenneth Apicerno", "Thanks, Stephen. Operator, we are ready to open it up for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Tycho Peterson", "Marc, I wanted to start off with biopharma, obviously great growth there, 10%. Just wondering if you can provide a little bit more color, any budget flush dynamic? Can you comment on January trends? And then, as we think about bioprocess, any commentary there? We\u2019ve seen some good results out from your peers. So, can you guide us through kind of the inventory destock noise that we heard earlier last year?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. We had a very good year in pharmaceutical and biotech with high single-digit growth for the year, and in the fourth quarter was 10%. So, when I think about the fourth quarter, we really had strong quarter across the board, biosciences, analytical instruments, our research channel all did very well; bioproduction was very strong; clinical trials business, logistics business also grew, so really very positive. The way I see, the customers really understand the value we bring and we continue to gain share there. From a bioproduction standpoint, it was a good year for bioproduction, grew above the Company average. And as you know, we\u2019re very bullish about the mid and long term prospects for that business; it\u2019s got great tailwinds from a macro perspective. And we like the way we finished the year with a quarter of very strong growth.", "Tycho Peterson", "And then, for the follow-up the Lab Products and Services had a big step up sequentially here. Can you maybe just comment on what drove that? And I think you called that academic being up high single digits, just curious what the driver there was.", "Marc Casper", "The Lab Products and Services, really a very strong performance across all of the businesses. Our channel business had a very good end to the year. And sequentially, really one of the big drivers was our clinical trials logistic businesses returned to nice growth, right. As we mentioned a year plus ago, we\u2019re going to have a difficult first three quarters just based on a large study cancelation late in 2016. So, once we anniversaried that, you saw that business, which was great tailwind, returned to nice growth. So that\u2019s probably the biggest sequential change in that business.", "Tycho Peterson", "Okay. And then, can you just comment on the academic high single digit growth? And I\u2019ll leave it there.", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, academic and government was very strong in the quarter. We saw a good growth across all of the key geographies and we saw really good growth in our analytical instruments, particularly mass spectrometry and electron microscopy in that segment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken", "Good morning guys and I appreciate the whole organization welcoming back with such a good quarter. So, Marc, obviously, the macro backdrop is pretty good and the end markets you serve are quite healthy. But, it still feels like last 12 to 24 months incrementally your business is sort of doing better than peers. And it feels like whether it\u2019s mix or share or new technologies, you guys have been kind of gaining momentum on the top line. And so, how, when you think about sort of the more recent performance, are you kind of teasing out? How much of this is sort of the macro and some of the markets or some of the acquisitions versus some of the hard work the organization\u2019s doing to really have better results on the organic line?", "Marc Casper", "So, Ross, thanks for the question. And obviously, the end markets are good. And the biggest change really in 2017 was that industrial and applied turned back to mid single digit growth. So, that helps the industry, and obviously we benefited from it. But, we are performing much stronger over the last couple of years, as you highlighted, based on the success of the growth strategy. And when I think about last year, we delivered 5% organic growth and we would have delivered 5% organic growth even if you took out the contribution from FEI in the organic growth. So, we had a really strong year across the business. And it was really good execution. Our channel business had another really good year, when you look at our analytical instruments business, strength across the portfolio, and it was a good year on spend. So, all of those factors contributed to a very strong 2017, and it\u2019s another step up in performance in terms of our strategy.", "Ross Muken", "That\u2019s helpful. And may be just on China, I mean, lot of attention being focused there. You guys had another fantastic year. In terms of sort of differentiating between both the industrial and biopharma side there, how are you seeing sort of trends and how are you thinking about comps in that region as we enter next year and what\u2019s kind of the assumption baked into the 2018 guide.", "Marc Casper", "We continue to expect that China is going to be our fastest growing major geography within the Company. Our book to bill was above 1 in China and momentum is strong. There is a tremendous amount of interest in the diagnostics area, expanding healthcare and the applied markets, food safety, environmental protection. We\u2019re obviously benefiting a little bit from the industrial recovery as well, but it\u2019s really the alignment with the five-year plan that\u2019s driving the strong growth. And while we obviously will have a challenging comparison in 2018 in China, the team is off to a good start.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin", "So, just one cleanup question and one other one. So, on Q4, can you sort of break out -- you can do this as an aggregate; they don\u2019t have to be individual. But, sort of like what you thought the contributions were from the flu season being stronger, hurricane catch-up, any sort of budget flushes? I\u2019m basically just trying to figure it out to like model Q4 2018 better.", "Marc Casper", "Yes. So, I guess, the way I characterized the quarter, no real hurricane catch-up; we didn\u2019t see a significant impact in Q3 and it might be a small amount but really nothing creating the noise. The seasonal products were very strong. So, that\u2019s probably about half a percentage point in the quarter and then it\u2019s really about year-over-year spending at the end of the year by our customers, was slightly weaker last year, saw a good strength this year. So, maybe, in total a couple of points.", "Derik de Bruin", "Okay, great. Thanks. That\u2019s really helpful. And just I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m going to actually ask you a DNA sequencing question but I\u2019m going to. You\u2019ve made a lot of news -- there has been a lot of news following your sequencing business in 2017. And I\u2019m just wondering it\u2019s been a while since we sort of have an update on the overall size of that business and sort of like how the business has been growing. Can you guys provide us that? And then, I want to ask what sort of drove the decision to sort of do the relationship with Illumina for the AmpliSeq product? ", "Marc Casper", "Derik, in terms of next gen sequencing, represents just under 2% of our revenue in kind of order of magnitude. It\u2019s a business that is growing reasonably well. We\u2019ve had a lot of good product launches during the course of 2017. At the very beginning of this year, we announced a new line of sequencers, two new Oncomine panels, one focused on immuno-oncology, which is obviously very important; and one focused on liquid biopsy. The early feedback from customers on all of the new products is very positive. We\u2019re also launching in chemistry for our sequencers. Terms of Illumina obviously they have a very large install base of instruments. And our amplification chemistry is very well regarded. And we made the decision to supply them with those chemistries so that they can mark it on their install base. And we felt like that\u2019s a good growth opportunity. And given the fact that we continue to launch new products, we were comfortable with that combination of moves.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel", "So, you closed out 2017 with your net debt to EBITDA ratio below 4 times, as currently built, we see that getting close to 3 times by the end of this year. Is it fair to say that you\u2019re open for business for the right acquisition, based on where your balance sheet is today? And if so, I guess, a multiparter here, how should we think about your capacity, how do we think about the application of your typical ROI criteria in the continue high valuation environment, and how does certainty, on the tax law, impact the M&A environment?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. We\u2019re open for business and being here time, we\u2019ve never been closed. But, we have a very active pipeline. And part of the reason the way we financed the Patheon acquisition was we issued some level -- modest level of equity as part of that, so that we would never take ourselves out of the market at this point in time, because the Patheon integration really is only one narrow part of the Company. So, we felt like we had the management bandwidth to push through good opportunities. And so, we\u2019re in that mode. We really have a substantial amount of capacity. So, I don\u2019t feel constrained financially in terms of deal size from that perspective.", "In terms of ROI on transactions, as you\u2019ve heard me say in the past, when valuations are higher, we always have used the criteria that we don\u2019t do bad transactions, meaning that we really focus on the downside scenario of the transaction and ensure that we\u2019re going to drive good returns, even if something doesn\u2019t work out. So, it does inform the kinds of transactions that we do in this type of market. And if you look at it, we avoided speculative transactions, we bought really great businesses. FEI is a good example where it\u2019s a business that we spent years looking at and thinking about, understanding the business and bought it at a part of the cycle where it was growing around 3%, we were able to grow it in the first year of ownership in the strong double digits. And that\u2019s kind of a nose we have for M&A. So, we\u2019ll buy things that we feel we understand the downside scenario with and are going to make good returns for our shareholders on ROI under all the different scenarios that are possible.", "Doug Schenkel", "And I just want to go back to two topics that came up earlier in the Q&A session but I don\u2019t think were addressed completely clearly. First, just to be clear, based on what you\u2019re seeing thus far in 2018, are you confident that there was no meaningful pull forward of revenue into Q4 at the expense of Q1? And on the question of bioproduction destocking, the dynamic that was out there across the industry earlier in 2017, are you confident that that\u2019s largely abated?", "Marc Casper", "So, I\u2019ve never heard someone say to answer that question. So, that\u2019s a first. So, Doug, I guess, the year\u2019s off to a good start consistent with our guidance. When I look at how bookings were for the last year, they were above 1. So, we enter the year with a good backlog, and there\u2019s nothing unusual about how the year started that would indicate some sort of customer pull forward or something that was meaningful. So, I think that\u2019s the view.", "In terms of bioproduction, it\u2019s a business we\u2019ve been in for a very, very long time. We really don\u2019t spend a lot of intellectual energy around quarter-to-quarter movements there because customers shouldn\u2019t pull forward and push out orders all the time. What I would say is that the pipeline is strong, the business had a very good year and the customer activity is really positive. So, we feel good about the outlook for that business for 2018 and feel like the end was a good sign. But, we don\u2019t get too hung up on as a quarter strong or weak. It\u2019s business as lumpy and that\u2019s why I said the mid-term and long-term look really excellent for us.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan", "Thanks. Good morning, guys. I wanted to start with Patheon. Could you give us an update on the outsourcing discussions there with customers since the acquisition, just traction on revenue synergies? And then, has the dialogue changed at all since the beginning of the year with tax reform?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. Jack, thank you for the question, good morning. In terms of performance services business or Patheon, the customer feedback has been incredibly positive and we\u2019re having meaningful dialogue with a number of customers. This is a business that doesn\u2019t turn quickly in terms of there\u2019s a long process of getting products, tech transfer and things of that sort. But nonetheless, the early feedback is very good and the revenue synergy work -- we already have achieved some revenue synergies between our clinical trials logistics business and our new pharma services capabilities. So, those are happening and they will ramp up over time. We have really interesting work going on with our bioproduction business and the biologics portion of that business as well. So, we\u2019re very bullish about the revenue growth outlook in the midterm for that business.", "On the tax side of the equation, I think really the pharmaceutical customers have to think through how does the tax law change their manufacturing strategy because a lot of their older strategies were about putting plants in low tax jurisdictions of which some of the advantages to those are no longer as compelling. And therefore, it\u2019s possible that opens up new opportunities over time. So, that\u2019s something that we will continue to explore with our customers.", "Jack Meehan", "Great. That\u2019s helpful. And just if I could step back, you have long term organic growth target of 4 to 6%, you ended 2017 with a lot of momentum and portfolio is moving in the faster growing areas with FEI and Patheon. Just how would you frame the guidance of 4 to 5% in that context and what are some of the puts and takes as you sit here today?", "Marc Casper", "Yes. As we\u2019ve thought about the outlook for the year, we felt good about the 4 to 5% initial guidance for organic growth. And the way we think about it is, as the year unfolds, obviously we adjust the guidance. We felt like -- we like the way the end markets are, we like the way the year ended, we obviously feel good about our orders as well. The things that we will pay attention to later in the year is we\u2019re going to have a challenging fourth quarter comparison because of the year-end. So, we\u2019re assuming in the guidance a normal year-end spend as opposed to the very strong year-end spend. So, that\u2019s one we\u2019re not going to know obviously until the fourth quarter, but that would be one of the factors. And then, obviously, if GDP growth continues to accelerate, which appears to be accelerating around the world that obviously could be a tailwind as well. And you could flip it the other way on what would be things that would be headwinds would be if it goes in the opposite direction.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Steve Beuchaw", "First question is with regard to the analytical instruments business. You saw a nice pick-up there recently. It would be helpful, if you could sort of talk through what you saw second half of the year in a retrospective. How much of this is improvement in the end markets and how much of it is new product flow? And then, for 2018, any color you can give us on how you\u2019re thinking about modeling the business would be really helpful, not only with regard to the sustainability of some of those divers but because we\u2019re including FDI in the organic component, which can be a pretty significant benefit to the organic profile of that business. Thanks.", "Marc Casper", "So, in terms of looking back, and then I will talk looking forward. Looking back in the second half, we obviously had good new products across the portfolio. So, that\u2019s a contributor, mass spectrometry big beneficiary, electron microscopy as well. The other thing in second half is our chemical analysis business, particularly our handheld portable instruments, which kind of represents short cycle industrial recovery, was very good. So, it was very broad base in terms of the growth and the instruments business throughout the year and in the second half. As I think about 2018 and FEI and how to think about it. FEI had very strong growth; our electron microscopy had very strong growth in 2017. That makes for a challenging comparison this year. We anticipate that the business will be a contributor to our growth and grow above the Company average during the course of this year. So, it\u2019s how we would think about it, based on a spectacular 2017, and we see momentum continuing into 2018, but obviously not as big of contributor because of the comparison.", "Steve Beuchaw", "And then, just a couple of housekeeping items, one is, I wonder if you could speak at all what fourth quarter underlying growth was in Patheon, how the impact of some of the Puerto Rico challenges impacted that and do we capture some of that back in the first quarter potentially? And then, Stephen, could you give us any sense for what the working capital outlook is year-on-year embedded in the guidance assumption for free cash flow? ", "Marc Casper", "In terms of Puerto Rico, we don\u2019t believe that we will see a pickup in Q1 at normal rates. But, the customers effectively had big products they had to source, so likely bought the product form other source at that point. We may see a little bit of uptick during the course of the year, but I wouldn\u2019t think that\u2019s a particularly big factor. Underlying growth for the Patheon business for 2017, if you -- obviously not in our numbers but mid single digit year-over-year growth for that business. So, solid growth here and obviously they had headwind. So, I feel good about performance there.", "Stephen Williamson", "In terms of working capital assumption for 2018, it is essentially kind of a normal year of need for working capital to grow the business organically at the 4% to 5% level, so not expecting a significant difference in the norm there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Patrick Donnelly from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Patrick Donnelly", "Maybe just following up on Jack\u2019s question about the long-term organic growth rate, 4 to 6. In the past, you\u2019ve always talked about one end market has been a headwind, preventing you from getting towards the upper end. But, in the current setup, I know Marc you noted a few weeks ago, end markets are as healthy as they\u2019ve been. Do you view 2018 as the best shot you can recall getting towards that 6% number, assuming the current macro backdrop holds up and you have full year of FEI contribution?", "Marc Casper", "Every year we\u2019re always working to maximize the performance of the Company and strengthen the strategic position. And as we go into the year, we feel good about the outlook. And historically, we\u2019ve generally been around 4% as our opening view on organic growth; and this year, obviously, we did 4% to 5%. So, it reflects the momentum. And we\u2019ll drive to the best possible performance. Patheon is not a big contributor to our organic growth this year; it doesn\u2019t flow in until the final four months of the year. So, while it\u2019ll contribute, it is not going to contribute meaningfully to organic growth this year. So, we\u2019re going to deliver four really strong quarters, and we\u2019ll see ultimately where that winds up in terms of organic growth.", "Patrick Donnelly", "And then, obviously, your LPS results speak for themselves to a degree but would appreciate if you could just maybe provide some color on the Amazon threat to your business. It seems like that\u2019s got a little more air time this past quarter, in spite of their presence not being particularly new. So, have you seen any change in the market from them, are you expecting anything different? We would appreciate your thoughts?", "Marc Casper", "In Amazon, we take it extraordinarily seriously, right? And we\u2019ve taken it extraordinarily seriously over the last five years as they thought about and tried different things in this market, and they\u2019ve largely been unsuccessful, and there\u2019re reasons for that. And I think a lot of the reasons for that is that we\u2019re relentlessly focused on doing a great job for our customers. And many of you have heard me say, we\u2019re the Amazon of scientific supplies. We do a great job of aggregating a complex set of categories, providing a very cost effective way for our customers to drive productivity, world-class logistics, on-site personnel handling very technically difficult products, hazardous fluids, refrigeration, we have great supplier relationships. And at the end of the day, we\u2019ve built an amazing web capability to make it very easy for our customers to transact with us. So, we\u2019ll take it very seriously. We have seen momentum from Amazon. And we\u2019ve had great performance in our channel business the last couple of years and ended on the strong note. So, we\u2019ll continue to pay attention to it, but feel good about our competitive position.", "Patrick Donnelly", "Very helpful. Thanks.", "Marc Casper", "Operator, we have time for just one more.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Dan Arias", "Marc, just following up on academic, what\u2019s your assumption for NIH funding this year? Obviously some good legislation out there, but it kind of also feels like we could live in continuing resolution land for a while, so just wondering whether your base case, so to speak, as U.S. funding going up in fiscal 2018?", "Marc Casper", "In terms of the outlook for academic and government for the year, we\u2019re assuming in our guidance low to mid single digit growth. We\u2019re assuming that we will get a budget at some point in the year and that in that there\u2019d be a modest level of growth. And that\u2019s why you have the range for the segment between low and mid single digits, just depends on when a budget gets passed. I did have a chance to meet with NIH leadership recently. And they\u2019re operating under a stable environment and expect over time when the budget gets passed, it should get better. If I think about the other end markets, diagnostics and health care, we\u2019re also assuming low to mid single digit growth for this year; pharma and biotech, we\u2019re assuming mid to high single digit; in industrial, we\u2019re assuming mid single digit. It kind of gives you a holistic view of the year.", "Dan Arias", "Yes. That\u2019s great. Thank you. And then maybe just one for Stephen. Stephen, what is necessary for LPS margin to be up in 2018? It looks like you\u2019ll be up against a favorable comp obviously but just wondering more fundamentally what the key factors are to getting back to the mid teens.", "Stephen Williamson", "So, I think the individual businesses are doing well; it\u2019s really been around business mix has been driving the change; this year has been the principal driver. You\u2019re going to see actually benefit from margins from Patheon through the anniversary date for the LPS side of the equation. So, I guess the underlying businesses are actually doing well.", "Marc Casper", "So, let me wrap up the call with a couple of quick comments, the first of which is I\u2019d like to thank Seth Hoogasian, our General Counsel who\u2019s been our General Counsel for more than 20 years, retiring at the end of the quarter. He\u2019s been the silent right hand of the management team for a long period of time. And we wish him a happy retirement and thank him for his service to the Company. And then for the reflection of the year, obviously, 2017 was an excellent year and has put us in a great position to achieve our growth goals for the year. And as always, thank you for the ongoing support of Thermo Fisher Scientific. And I look forward to interacting with you during the course of the year.
