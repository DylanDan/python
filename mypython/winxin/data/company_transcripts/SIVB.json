My name is Adrianne and I'll be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded. I'll now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary. Meghan O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Adrianne and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our first quarter 2017 financial results and we'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We expect the call, including Q&A, to last approximately an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Gregory Becker", "Great. Thanks, Meghan. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. In the first quarter of 2017, SVB delivered earnings per share of $1.91 and net income of $101.5 million. These results reflect solid loan growth, healthy growth in total client funds, higher net interest income and NIM and stable credit quality despite higher NPLs. And although, we experienced some seasonal slowness in core fee income, year-over-year fee income trends are positive.", "Looking at the first quarter of 2017 versus the same period last year, we saw good growth. We grew net interest income by 10%. We grew core fee income by 8%. We grew loans by 18% and both average and period-end loan balances exceeded $20 billion for the first time. We grew total client funds by 5% and we grew our net commercial client count by more than 12%.", "Overall, our business is performing well. Our pipeline for 2017 is solid. And we finally received some help from higher rates. With positive impact of rate increases as well as a more visibility into full year deposits and credit trends from our performance in the first quarter, we will be updating several of our full year 2017 outlook items. Mike will go into detail on those in a few minutes.", "Now I'd like to discuss the market environment and provide some perspective on why we remain positive about 2017. The environment for our clients remains healthy, although, not without its challenges. Raising money was the top challenge identified by startup executives in our recent annual Startup Outlook Survey. Fortunately, there is continued investor appetite and capital for good companies, especially those that can demonstrate growth. While U.S. venture capital investment in the first quarter pulled back from its 2016 highs, the number of deals in the first quarter was still healthy and dollars invested increased over the fourth quarter. Overall, we view this progression as an expected and desirable return to normalcy. With estimated levels of dry powder in venture capital greater than $100 billion, most of that raised in the last 2 years, we believe there is sufficient capital to fuel the innovation ecosystem and that good companies will continue to get funding.", "Having added more than 1,000 new clients in the first quarter, we see evidence that new company formation is still healthy, even if it's down from historic highs. Exit markets were relatively active in the first quarter, although, they too remain below historic highs. There were 7 U.S. venture-backed IPOs in the innovation space in the first quarter, 3 of which were SVB clients. Another 7 VC-backed technology and life science companies have filed to go public in the second quarter and there is a healthy pipeline of companies that reportedly planning for an IPO later this year.", "In M&A, the total number of deals in the first quarter declined by 18% over the first quarter last year, although, the value of these deals rose by 9%. Nevertheless, corporate acquisitions remained a significant force in exit markets, driven in part by strategic acquisitions by companies positioning themselves to remain competitive in the future. Among our clients, the pace of M&A remain brisk and M&A remains the most common exit for startups. Half of the respondents to our Startup Outlook Survey indicated they expect the pace of M&A to increase this year. We believe the current VC market conditions represent a sustainable pace of fundraising and investment. And while exits are off to a modest start, we still expect 2017 to be a better year for liquidity for our clients relative to 2016. In the meantime, we remain focused on building our business, expanding our global reach and providing our unique value-add to our clients in the innovation ecosystem.", "We continue to build momentum in our payments business, increasing card revenue 14% year-over-year in the first quarter. This growth was driven largely by accelerating activity in our multicard program which provides integrated purchasing and corporate [indiscernible] functions, including secure virtual cards which grew by 63% during that period. And despite seasonal slowness in credit cards in the first quarter, activity accelerated from January to March, with March being the highest card spend month in our history.", "We're building out our global footprint and capabilities, providing partnership and support to high-growth innovation companies doing business around the world. We have generated significant momentum as a key player in the thriving innovation ecosystems of the Western Europe and Israel. Our U.K. and Israel offices today have more than 1,400 clients, representing a 28% growth rate in the past year.", "Loan balances for the combined regions increased 25% year-over-year on a constant-currency basis. FX trade volumes increased 41% and payment volumes increased 55%. We continue to move our joint venture bank strategy forward. In February, our joint venture bank in China opened its second branch and now operates in Beijing as well as Shanghai. These 2 cities have historically been home to 60% of all VC-backed companies in China. And we're making progress in our plans to expand into Germany and Canada. We're close to submitting our applications in both locations and pending regulatory approval, we believe both branches could be operational in 2018. More broadly, we continue to leverage our unique position in the innovation markets on behalf of our clients to provide insight and partnership to entrepreneurs, innovators and investors.", "In addition to our 2017 startup outlook, we released our annual report on trends in healthcare investments and exits in January. This report predicts 2017 investments in IPOs on par with 2016 biopharma as the strongest sector and improving M&A activity among healthcare companies at all life stages.", "We also released our annual State of the Wine Industry Report which predicts higher premium wine sales in 2017. Obviously, if this forecast plays out, it's a good news for our premium wine clients. And in April, we launched the sixth class of our commerce innovated accelerator program. This program is designed to help commerce, payments and fintech startups grow by providing with mentorship, support, advice and introductions. This year, we're partnering with First Data which brings expertise and resources to the table that we believe will provide a significant advantage for our fintech startups. We launched the commerce innovated program in 2014 and to date, have worked with 24 commerce payments and fintech focused startups. More than half of this companies have raised funding or going to acquire it, since graduating from the program. These are a just few examples of the many ways in which we differentiate ourselves in the market.", "Regarding challenges. Little has changed with regard to the challenges we face. While the impacts of last year's market recalibration continue to fade, our clients are still feeling effects of access to capital and valuations. And while loan originations remain robust, a high rate of M&A activity among our technology and life science clients remains a drag on our loan growth.", "Stepping back to look at the broader industry, competition remains intense for all banks. Stagnating traditional banks and lightly regulated nonbanks are all searching for growth and the innovation economy is a key target for them. This competition has continued to drive down pricing and impact the pace of loan growth. While the broader markets have been more positive and less volatile than in recent quarters, there is still uncertainty about the health of the U.S. economy, the likely pace of rate increases and tax reform. We believe this uncertainty will likely cause more volatility over the coming quarters.", "The competition, market volatility and uncertainty have been the norm for most of the last decade. While we're always adapting to deal with challenge and change, at the same time, we're taking proactive actions to enhance our business in market position and improve our operational efficiency. Our strong growth has been enabled by our expansion into key markets, such as private equity and private banking and by our long-standing commitment to supporting our clients globally. A significant pace of new client wins is a direct result of our ongoing work to form relationships with each successive generation of new entrepreneurs, whether they're VC-backed or bootstrapped, located in Silicon Valley or on the other side of the world. Our continued fee income growth reflects our successful focus on creating cooperation across borders and teams that enable us to take a more holistic approach to understanding and solving our clients' problems. And our focus on creating operational efficiencies while investing in our growth has enabled us to drive down our efficiency ratio over time.", "On top of that, our unique position in the innovation industry and focus on being the best partner to entrepreneurs, companies and investors remain significant competitive advantage. Our consistency has allowed us to deliver growth and high-quality results over the long term, regardless of market and competitor dynamics. We intend to stay focused on strong execution and maintaining our distinct competitive advantage in the innovation ecosystem.", "Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg and good afternoon, everyone. I would like to start by talking at a high level about certain notable items that were included in our earnings per share of $1.91. I will get into further details on these items later in my comments. But I believe this overview will enable you to more easily separate the seasonal or notable items from fundamental trends which are generally positive and on track overall.", "On the plus side, we realized a tax benefit from a change in accounting rules for stock-based compensation which contributed $6.1 million to earnings. This accounting change affects all companies. We also had a benefit to earnings of $4.7 million due to the return of tax funds related to a prior year's tax return. Countering those 2 items, we incurred our typical first quarter seasonal compensation expenses from bonus-related 401(k) contributions and employer taxes of approximately $6.5 million. Premium amortization expense from investment securities in the first quarter was $3.5 million higher than last quarter. And there were 2 fewer days in the quarter compared to the last quarter which meant lower net interest income of approximately $4.8 million.", "Now I will get into the details of the quarter and highlight the following, first, solid loan growth; second, another quarter of healthy total client funds growth, driven by our off-balance sheet client investment funds; third, higher net interest income and a higher net interest margin; fourth, stable credit quality overall; fifth, higher investment securities and warrant gains; and sixth, slightly higher noninterest expense, including the seasonal expenses I noted. Additionally, I will comment on our capital ratios, tax rate and provide details on the changes to our 2017 outlook that Gregg mentioned.", "Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $809 million or 4.2% to $20.1 billion. Growth was driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and life sciences. Other parts of the portfolio were relatively flat in the first quarter, although, this is consistent with what we have seen in the first quarter in past years. Nevertheless, we're seeing a continued high pace of repayment due to M&A. On the upside, despite heavy competition and seemingly loosening terms in the market, new loan commitments were solid and advances were strong in the quarter. Client activity remains healthy across all portfolios and our pipeline is in good shape. As a result, we're maintaining our full year 2017 loan growth outlook of the high-teens.", "Moving to total client funds, that is combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. We saw another quarter of healthy growth due to client funding rounds and exit activity. Average total client funds grew $1.4 billion or 1.7% to $86.1 billion in the first quarter. This reflected average off-balance sheet client investment funds growth of $1.2 billion and average deposit growth of $261 million. This growth reflected strong activity among our life science and corporate finance clients. Although, that growth was offset somewhat by significant outflows related to our private equity clients making distributions to their investors.", "Period-end total client funds grew by $2.7 billion or 3.2% to $87.5 billion. This reflected off-balance sheet client investment funds growth of $637 million and deposit growth of $2.1 billion which means we're starting the second quarter on a positive note. This growth was driven by existing private equity clients, as well as strong new client acquisition in our life science and early stage technology segments. Nevertheless, we're narrowing our full year 2017 outlook for deposit growth to the mid-single digits from our previous outlook of mid- to high-single digits, although, we believe growth is likely to be at the high-end of our revised range. While strong new client acquisition continues to drive deposit inflows, it is offset by high pace of investment and distribution activity among our private equity clients.", "Turning now to net interest income and our net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $13.4 million to $310.3 million in the first quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher average loan balances and an increase of 11 basis points in net loan yield due to the impact of the December increase in the Fed funds rate. Interest income from fixed income securities increased by $4.1 million due to higher average balances which benefited from reinvestment of portfolio cash flows at higher market rates.", "I would like to provide some additional insight into the timing and impact on our results from increases in short term interest rates. The sensitivity of our net interest income to changes in rates was generally in line with our expectations. However, when comparing our first quarter results with the fourth quarter of 2016, there are few specific items that should be considered as they impacted the actual increases in net interest income and our net interest margin. First, as I mentioned at the beginning of my comments, we had 2 fewer days and higher premium amortization expense in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Additionally, there is a lag effect of the impact of higher short term interest rates on approximately 30% of our loan portfolio which is tied to 30, 60 and 90-day LIBOR. In short, this means it can take almost 2 quarters to see the full effect of rate increases on these loans. Finally, certain of our sponsored buyout loans have a LIBOR floor of 1%. It is important to note that we're seeing margin compression, both in newly originated loans and existing renewals, as a result of competition and tightening market terms, primarily in our private equity, sponsored buyout and accelerator segments. We estimate that this has resulted in approximately 15 to 25 basis points of margin compression in these portfolios since the beginning of 2016 which is the time period covering the Fed rate increases in December 2015 and 2016. This equates to approximately $15 million to $20 million of net interest income on an annualized net basis. We expect margin compression to continue to impact our net interest income and net interest margin throughout the year despite the benefit from rate increases.", "Moving onto net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by 15 basis points in the first quarter to 2.88% due to higher average loan and investment securities balances relative to lower yielding cash balances as well as the impact of the December rate increase. This impact was partially offset by the increase in premium amortization expense and the compression in loan yields from competition which I just mentioned. As a result of the 25 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate in March, we're raising our outlook for net interest income and net interest margin. We expect net interest income to increase at a percentage rate in the high-teens compared to our previous outlook of the low teens. And we expect our net interest margin to be between 2.9% and 3.1% compared to our previous outlook of 2.8% to 3%.", "These expectations take into account the impact of margin compression I noted earlier, but do not assume any further increases in short term interest rates. Clearly, any rate increases will help our net interest income and our net interest margin.", "Now let us move to credit quality which remained stable overall despite higher nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for loan losses was $243.1 million at the end of the first quarter or 1.18% of total gross loans, an increase of $17.8 million or 5 basis points compared to the fourth quarter. Our provision for credit losses which includes the provision for funded and unfunded commitments, was $30.7 million versus $16.5 million in the fourth quarter. The increase in our allowance for loan losses and the provision for credit losses in the first quarter were due primarily to 3 nonaccrual loans, 2 new ones in the software space and 1 previously impaired sponsored buyout loan. These 3 loans accounted for $16.7 million of the $25.4 million of specific reserves added in the first quarter. In addition, loan growth in the quarter contributed an additional $5 million.", "Net charge-offs were significantly lower at $12.2 million or 25 basis points compared to $21.3 million or 44 basis points in the fourth quarter. Approximately 60% of charge-offs had prior reserves and nearly 90% came from our early-stage clients. Nonaccrual loans increased by $19.8 million to $138.8 million or 68 basis points of total gross loans. This increase was primarily due to 1 late-stage and 1 early-stage client. We view this as a manageable level of - for nonperforming loans. However, it is near the high-end of our outlook range. As a result, we're slightly increasing our outlook range for nonperforming loans by 10 basis points to between 60 and 80 basis points of total gross loans. This increase reflects the gradual evolution of our loan portfolio over time to include more growth, corporate finance and sponsored buyout loans. However, we're maintaining our full year 2017 outlook for the allowance for loan losses which we expect to be comparable to 2016 levels and for net loan charge-offs of between 30 and 50 basis points.", "Now I will turn to noninterest income which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and PE and VC-related investment securities. I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. GAAP noninterest income was $117.7 million compared to $113.5 million in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP, noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $111.1 million compared to $109.1 million in the fourth quarter. The increase was mainly related to higher, though, still relatively modest net gains on investment securities and warrants which were offset somewhat by seasonally lower core fee income.", "Let me review the components. First, non-GAAP, net gains, net of noncontrolling interest on investment securities were $9.5 million compared to $5.3 million in the fourth quarter. Second, we had net gains of $6.7 million on equity warrant assets, primarily related to warrant exercises driven by M&A activity during the quarter. This compares to warrant gains of $4.6 million in the fourth quarter, primarily related to unrealized valuation increases.", "Moving onto core fee income which includes fees from foreign exchange, credit cards, deposit service charges, lending-related activities, letters of credit and client investment funds. Core fee income decreased by $2.1 million or 2.4% to $82.6 million in the first quarter. This decrease was due primarily to seasonally lower fees on credit cards and foreign exchange. These decreases were partially offset by increases in client investment fees, driven by higher balances and improve yields due to increases in general market rates and an increase in deposit service charges due to higher deposit, client counts and transaction volumes. We're reiterating our full year core fee income outlook of growth in the high-teens.", "Moving onto expenses. Noninterest expense increased by $2.4 million or 1% to $237.6 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense.", "Compensation and benefits expense increased by $7.3 million as a result of annual merit pay raises and higher number employees to support our growth and seasonal expenses related to 401(k) matching and employer payroll taxes. These increases were offset by lower share-based compensation expenses and incentive compensation plan expenses in the first quarter which were elevated in the fourth quarter.", "As a result of our improved outlook for the full year and our other initiatives to enhance return on equity, we expect our 2017 return on equity to outperform most of our peers, as defined in our 2017 proxy. Because part of our incentive plans are tied to return on equity performance versus our designated peers, we expect higher performance related incentive compensation expense. Consequently, we're increasing our 2017 noninterest expense growth percentage outlook from the high single-digits to the low double-digits.", "Turning to capital. Our capital ratios rose across the board as a result of increased capital from higher net income. Increases to holding company capital ratios were partially offset by higher risk weighted assets due to period-end loan growth.", "Lastly, I would like to provide some insights into our effective tax rate. As I mentioned at the start of my comments, we recognized a $6.1 million tax benefits as a result of implementing new accounting guidance that is applicable to all companies effective this quarter. Under this guidance, tax impacts from employee share based transactions are recognized in the provision for income taxes rather than directly in equity under the prior rules. This guidance will likely result in volatility in our effective tax rate. The magnitude of the tax impact of employee share based transactions is a function of one, vesting days for restricted stock units; two, the amount of in the money stock options that are exercised; and three, the change in our stock price relative to the grant date values of the share based compensation awards. Excluding the impact of both the required accounting change and the other tax item I noted earlier, we expect the tax rate for 2017 to be comparable to 2016.", "In closing, we're off to a good start in 2017. Our outlook remains positive and our expectations for net interest income and net interest margin have improved as a result of the recent increase in the Fed funds rate. Although, competition and a high pace of M&A activity among our clients continue to impact loan growth and margin, there is ample new loan activity in the pipeline going into the second quarter look solid. Fee income trends also remain positive despite some seasonal slowness in the first quarter. We believe our clients are healthy overall and we're maintaining our long term focus on expanding our client base, product offerings and global footprint, while delivering high-quality growth and maintaining stable credit quality. While we're not counting our future rate increases, tax decreases or significant changes on the regulatory front, any improvements in these areas will likely be positive to our current outlook.", "Thank you. And now I will ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tyler Stafford from Stephens.", "Tyler Stafford", "I just want to start on the margin Can you talk about what the current new pricing is on the PE portfolio? And how that has - that pricing has incrementally changed or worsened over the last couple quarters?", "Marc Cadieux", "It's Marc Cadieux. So we look at the private equity reserves portfolio really in 2 components, private equity funds; and venture capital funds. With the venture capital funds tending to be about plus or minus 20 basis points higher. Blended together, we're at a blended note rate in the mid-3% range and that is up roughly 15 to 20 basis points quarter-over quarter.", "Tyler Stafford", "Okay. And then, what are the new reimbursement yields on the securities portfolio in 1Q?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So roughly, approximately around 2.5% and we're primarily mortgage-backed securities or agency-backed securities.", "Tyler Stafford", "Okay. And then, maybe just last one from me. Just a question to the - the reference in the release about the 10% of the variable portfolio that won't reprice in 2017, is that because of the levels of the floors that are on those 10%? Or due to the frequency of the repricing of that variable book?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So there's a few things. I'm not quite sure what you referred to in the 10%, but if you're referring to the 30, 60, 90-day LIBOR-based loans or the sponsored buyout loans that have floors with the LIBOR floor of one.", "Gregory Becker", "Tyler, this Greg. My assumption is you are probably talking about the mortgage portfolio. So it is variable rate, but clearly, it takes - it's a longer tenure than just pricing - with repricing with prime and that price is about the 10%. It's the arms that we have in the mortgage portfolio.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "On the expenses, what changed this quarter that drove such elevated comp expense and the related increase in the expense outlook? Was it all this new incentive plan that Mike discussed?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Well, Steve, you may recall that in my prepared remarks, typically, each first quarter of the year, we have the seasonal expenses there, right? So that is what drives kind of the expenses. If you're comparing Q1 to Q4, so they were $6.5 million of seasonal expenses in Q1, so that's part of it. The other thing is, when you start to look at some of the incentive compensation levels, our stock price was up as well - stock-based compensation expenses compared to a year ago as well, so just depends on what you're looking at, but primarily with the seasonal expenses. As far as the outlook for 2017, the rise in price and there was a fact that some of our incentive compensation plans are tied to ROE. And given our outlook for the full year in terms of ROE, that is up compared to the designated peer set in our proxy. Therefore, the incentive compensation pool is going to be funded at a bit of higher rate. So primarily, the main driver of us moving up our expense outlook is driven by the more improved outlook view on the return on equity against our peers.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. That's helpful, Mike. Maybe for Marc, on the [indiscernible] increase, any read-throughs for the rest of the software and Internet portfolio? And when we look at the $34 million increase, the release says that there were 2 loans, I think, 1 early-stage and 1 late. But Mike, I thought you said there was also 1 sponsored-led buyout loan, so maybe you could reconcile that?", "Marc Cadieux", "Sure. So maybe just starting with the increase in nonperforming loans, it's up roughly $20 million quarter-over quarter and a couple of things, I think, that will - I think just help put things in perspective. So the first is, nonperforming loans. This really isn't unusual this quarter. For the last couple of years, we've had guidance that has ranged as high as 100 basis points of nonperforming loans. And so where we're at present, I don't think is being too terribly different from where we've been over the last couple of years. And again, this is a function of having more or large loans in the portfolio.", "Second, I just would note again, as Mike mentioned, that we're not changing our guidance for charge-offs or the ALLL. And while - finally, while nonperforming loans do tend to be dynamic by their nature, we do feel like we're adequately reserved for the potential loss exposure in there. Turning to your question just to sort out the 2 versus 3, we had 2 new nonperforming loans, 1 later-stage, 1 early-stage that are the primary driver of the $20 million increase. I think the reference to the 3 loans goes to what drove specific reserves for nonperforming loans which was higher reserves, related to those or new reserves related to those 2 new nonperformers and a higher reserve related to one existing nonperforming loan.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. That's helpful. If I can maybe squeeze one more. And I was just looking for more color on the slowdown in the deposit growth and the narrowing of the guidance range. Are you just seeing fewer startups getting funded bring cash into the bank?", "Gregory Becker", "So Steve, this is Greg. No, we add - as I mentioned in my comments, we added more than 1,000 new clients in the first quarter which is pretty consistent with what we've seen over the last really 6 to 8 quarters with some little bit bouncing around from quarter-to quarter, so that's still solid. And if you look at the total client funds, the total client funds actually was a healthy number for the quarter. And so you're really looking at just - we can't perfectly guide the balances, whether it's in deposits or off-balance sheet. And if you are little behind in the first quarter, obviously, that carries through for the balance of the year. And so we just said, when we looked at the numbers and we looked at where deposits flows were on-balance sheet that it made sense to kind of move towards the lower end of the range that we had already given. So I wouldn't read anything else into it. The total client funds numbers is still healthy and so as the new client count.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo.", "Jared Shaw", "Just circling back on the margin, you just spoke - I like the - you did a good job of explaining the difference between the competitive pressures this quarter, upsetting the benefit from higher rates, but if we expect or if we see higher rates, additional rate hikes this year, do you think that, that competitive pressure is now fully reflected in that margin guidance? Or would there be less asset sensitivity in the model incrementally as we go forward?", "Michael Descheneaux", "We believe we picked up that. But obviously, it is - it does change quarter-to quarter when you're on the market competition, it's also dictated by what your competitors are doing. So it's - obviously, it's a bit harder to predict. But, again, we would - the numbers we gave you just in the margin compression that we've seen in the last year. But generally, if you kind of use that as a rule of thumb, we're probably going pickup about 70% of the benefit going forward, somewhere around there is a current estimates, but just want to caution that can change up or down quite quickly.", "Jared Shaw", "Yes, sure. That's great. And then on the VC outlook when you talked about the dry powder sitting there in the market, what you think is really holding back some of that investment? Is it more the valuations that you're seeing in the market? Or is it just lack of opportunity? Or is it maybe more of a macro view on taxes and wanting to wait to make those investments?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. I think the important point to make is that, the level of investment that we see we would describe and many of the people in the market would describe is being a healthy level. So I wouldn't say it's being held back. Actually, for me, it's a healthy discipline that actually should be in place. And I've said this in prior quarters. If we see - if we've saw what we saw in '15 again, that pace of investment, those numbers of companies being funded, we should be a little concerned. And so I think this is a healthy level. I think it's great. We have the dry powder. It gives us a solid outlook for not just the next few quarters, but really the next 18 to 24 months. So I would just say it's healthy and I think they're being disciplined, so it's a good thing.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay. And then, finally for me on the international expansion, especially, with Canada and Germany, are those going to be more structured like we see in the U.K. where it's a full-service loan and deposit operation in those markets? Or is it just more of a maybe a deeper exposure for loan sourcing and funding?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, it's a great question. And it will be different than the U.K. Our intention against other 2 regulatory approval is that both the offices will operate more like loan production offices. There will be branches, but operate more as lending offices. And so it's not just that we'll have just loan related income out of it, because Canada, obviously, there's a lot of activity with those Canadian companies in the U.S. and other markets, so we'll have deposit activities with those. We'll have FX opportunities in Germany the same thing. But we won't have the same branch structure deposit taking capabilities that we have in the U.K. That could change over time. But right now, we think that's the right place to a start in both markets.", "Jared Shaw", "And how much of that expansion is - how much of the growth in the expense outlook is due to the branch expansion or not that much at all?", "Gregory Becker", "There's a little bit there. I mean, if you add up both areas, you're probably looking at anywhere from $3 million to $5 million would be my range for 2017.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore.", "Rahul Patil", "This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. Just going back to expenses, the FTE account was up 42 to around 2,300 this quarter. Where are the hiring efforts largely focused on? Is it mainly front-end lending officers? Or is it maybe on the back office compliance risk management? Just trying to get a sense for the potential upward pressure on comp expense going forward.", "Michael Descheneaux", "It's probably somewhere around 40%, 45% front office and the rest is back office, somewhere around that neighborhood.", "Rahul Patil", "Okay. And then, the efficiency ratio this quarter was around 55.5%. Longer term, where do you see this ratio heading toward? And what sort of rate outlook would be required to get you there?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Well, obviously, it all depends on the rate outlook and the efficiency ratio. Clearly, we've been trying to bring that down. And the trend has been coming down over the last couple of years, so that we've exhibited a really nice trend there. But, obviously, we still didn't make - need to make investments as well too, but again, I think, you can continue to see general trend. Certainly, the general trend is going down, but again, it all depends on what you're assuming for the rate increase, because clearly, when we have the rate increase, we get a significant amount of revenues without any real incremental expenses. So it really just comes back to how you're modeling to your interest rate changes.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW.", "Christopher McGratty", "Mike, quick question on the expenses. Just want to make sure I'm starting with the right figure for this year. I know, last quarter, you've reclassed some unfunded from the provision to the expense line. Is the right number to start with around 870 for the expenses and then build the growth rate off of that?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So well, I guess, what you do is, you look at the 2016 number, obviously that we finished out. For clarity, we did move the provision for unfunded credit commitments out of expenses to combine it with the provision for loan losses. So that in itself created a little bit of uptick in the interest rate - sorry, in the expense outlook as well too. But I think if you just do reconcile that, I can certainly work with you offline to show what to start with. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me.", "Christopher McGratty", "And maybe, Greg, for you. Last quarter, you talked about this year being the year of liquidity. Obviously, there has been some noted IPOs and exits in the first quarter. Obviously, it's only a 3-month change in terms of sentiment. But how would you characterize what if any change you're seeing in your customers behavior or you're feeling about the exit markets?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, so I think you brought up, although, I can describe it the right way. One quarter is a little bit difficult to judge where we're. But I'll tell you, Chris, when we talk to our clients, when we look at the pipeline of companies that are either have filed to go public, talking about going public or just M&A discussions that are going on in general, I still feel the same as I said earlier. I still think that 2017 is going to be a solid year for liquidity. Now, again, what I want to make sure we caveat is that, it's mainly [indiscernible] to '16, that's a low bar. So I don't believe it's going to be a gangbuster year, but at the same time, I would describe it and still believe it will be a healthy year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron Deer", "Congratulations on opening the new branch in China. So I guess following upon on the international discussion, can you give us a sense of kind of what the level of activity is over there at this point?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, so I'll start. Mike, may want to add, as Mike is also on the - our China JV board. Activity is strong, but, again, you're going from a very low base. So your growth rates are, again, very solid, but it's one of the things where it's kind of 2 step forward, 1 back when you have a small balance sheet that's what you have in the joint venture, you've got to manage deposits, you have to manage the loan growth and it's more complex which is why we continue to say that China is a long term play. The joint venture is hovering around breakeven. And we expect that even as it grows and makes more money, we want to plough that income back into the growth of the business. But we feel that, again, over time, we're adding value right now, enterprise value to the joint venture and we'll continue to grow that business, but it's still small.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. And then, on the core noninterest income guidance for kind of high-teens growth for this year, looking the year-over-year first quarters, it was up 8%. So I guess, I'm just - what gives you the confidence that you're going to see more of an acceleration here in '17 than what we see in the quarter-over quarter numbers?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, it's a great question. We obviously looked that as well when first quarter results came out. And Mike and I both try to provide a little bit color on that. So there's a couple components to it. So one is, you have to look at credit card fees. As I described, you had January and February where a little bit slow, march picked up dramatically. And we feel that spend rate is likely to continue to occur, March being an all-time high card spend. That's number one. Number two, we're hearing and we're seeing a lot more activity in the FX side on forwards and options and sitting and talking to or FX teams. There is high-growth expectations for the balance of the year and the team is comfortable with that as an outlook.", "And the third category would be client investment funds. And remember, those - that doesn't take much to change that. And you saw about $800,000 with the growth in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. You're averaging about 7.5 basis points of margin to us in that client investment fees. And we believe that can get up to 10 to 11 basis points with the rate increases that we have experienced, it just hasn't all translated to that yet. So if you take those 3 factors together and bake that into the outlook, that's where we end up with the guidance that we provided and - which is why reiterated the numbers.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Just wanted to make sure, given the magnitude of this. So your NII guidance does not include any additional rate hikes which totally understand. If we do get the one in June which I think, I saw like 60-something percent probability, is the magnitude right coming from low-teens to high-teens that come to June hike or after it passes that NII guidance, is it reasonable to assume like low-20s? I'm just trying to make sure I think about this in the right way?", "Gregory Becker", "So this is Greg. I'll start and Mike you may add some color. So if it happens in June, you got, firstly, you only have half year, half the benefit of it, that's number one. The second part is that from a competitive standpoint, you have that. And I think you're going to be - my view is, Mike can correct me, you probably end up at the high-end of the high-teens, it may tip over to low double, but you're going to be in that general ballpark if we got the 25 basis points in June.", "Michael Descheneaux", "The other thing as we're trying to get across in our prepared remarks is remember on the LIBOR-based loans there is a little bit of a lag. So if a client has a 90-day LIBOR loan and let's say, it just got repriced a day before, the rate increase comes out in June, let's hope there is one, it's going to be 90 days before that loan even reprices which means you still have 90 days after that. So you're kind of looking at in that example 180 days. So it can take almost up to 2 quarters to see a full effect on some of these LIBOR-based loans there. So again, it eventually does come. It is sensitive to that, but it's just a little bit of a lag when you're repricing these 30, 60, 90-day LIBOR loan.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Got. Understood. Okay. And then, just going back to the competition question, is the competition - I mean, is it mostly like the private equity capital call lines? Or does it - where are you seeing most of the competition that you talked about earlier?", "Gregory Becker", "So this is Greg. I'll add some color to it and then Marc may want to add on to it. It is I would say generally across the board. And as I said in my prepared remarks, you have banks. And so at the later-stage companies, you have the larger more traditional monies that are banks competing for those deals. When you're looking at banks at the lower end or earlier stage or mid-stage deals, you have, again, broad competition from a variety of smaller more niche banks. And at the same time, you have nonbank lenders, same thing in sponsored led buyouts.", "We're seeing less competition from banks, although, it is competitive, but the main competition is coming from nonbanks, who have raised significant amount of private capital to go after sponsored buyout, both senior and junior debt. And who - quite, frankly, they don't have the same regulatory restrictions that banks have in leverage lending. And then, of course, in private equity services, because of the low-risk nature of that client base of the target market, you see heavy competition there as well. So you're really seeing it across the board.", "I would say this, in general and this is played out for many years, because of our reputation, because of our team, because of the value-add we bring, we tend to get a premium, just that premium continues to go down as they're willing to price at even lower and lower amounts. So it's something we've dealt with for a while. We're just being cognitive of the fact that it is a competitive market out there.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray.", "Brett Rabatin", "I wanted to ask on the expense guidance. I know you went through it pretty thoroughly, but just any additional color around just $50 billion in interest spending any money for that this year? Any thoughts on infrastructure spend and compliance?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Absolutely, Chris. I mean, we continue to invest and spend on that. We've been doing that for a couple of years. Each year, it probably goes by a couple of million. I mean, $3 million to $5 million increases per year. I mean, last year, I think we increased it around almost $8 million. This year, we may, again, take it up a bit as well. So we continue whether it's for a CCAR, whether it's for SIFI, there's still the whole host of other areas of compliance, whether it's BSA, AML all across the board that we continue to invest. This is part of being a larger bank, but it is embedded in our expense outlook.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay. And then, the other thing is just, Greg, you kind of mentioned early on access to capital was more difficult for some early-stage type companies. What gives you the confidence on those early-stage companies where they're ending their life cycle and M&A may not be their path? How are you seeing some of those credits? And I think last quarter it was 11 or 13 that you are sort of looking at that maybe would fall out. What's - is an updated number on that? And how do you sort of see some of those trends?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, I'll start and then I'm sure Marc will want to add on this. When you look at the numbers what we've said is that, it's returning to a normal or stability and we saw that in '16. And, obviously, we see that this quarter too which means, you've seen the normal falloff, the normal what I'll call failure rate of these early-stage companies, obviously, we need to do a good job of working with the right ones, with the right investors at the beginning. But that being said, you still have issues and it always doesn't go well. We believe that is factored into our outlook. We've dealt with this for many, many years. Obviously, we experienced this in 2016. And we spent a lot of time thinking about the guidance for 2017.", "Marc Cadieux", "So what I would just add to that is really 2 things. The first is, I think, it's important to remember that the number of early-stage borrowing clients is a relatively speaking small fraction of the number of early-stage banking clients that we have. And so said another way, while early-stage investing and that's the early-stage segment continues to be under pressure, that doesn't correspond perfectly to pressure on the early-stage part of our loan portfolio. That's what we saw reflected in the first quarter, while that pressure remains out there, while we continue to read about it and hear about it, you don't really see it reflected in the numbers to any great degree.", "You'd ask about, I think, a client count and maybe just starting with charge-offs, they're really 4 early-stage loans that make up about 3 quarters of the total gross charge-off number in the quarter. And then thinking about new early-stage nonperforming loans, there were really - there was 10 in all, but only 6 of what I call of consequence. And that rate of charge-off numbers and new nonperformers from the early-stage segment is really more or like what you would expect to see in any given quarter in normal times as opposed to being reflective of increased stress.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson.", "Gary Tenner", "Just had a question on securities portfolio and reinvestment. It looks like based on your outlook for loan growth and deposit growth for the year, the deposit growth will effectively fund the loan growth leaving the securities portfolio probably unchanged or roughly unchanged for the year. What's the quarterly runoff in reinvestment in the securities portfolio?", "Michael Descheneaux", "The maturities are roughly around $800 million per quarter somewhere around there. That's been pretty consistent for the last several quarters.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Okay. And you said that this past quarter, the reinvestment rate was around 2.5%?", "Michael Descheneaux", "That's correct.", "Gary Tenner", "Okay. And then just one other quick question. Obviously, you've got a vast amount of client funds on- or off-balance sheet. Deposit rates have just leaped up a tiny bit the last couple quarters, but remain very low. What's the sense of the ability to keep them at this level? Or do they kind of creep up at the same level we've seen the last couple quarters in terms of the interest-bearing deposits, excuse me?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes, I mean, we're seeing very little modest increases in the interest rate increases on just a few basis points. And I think we recently updated around 5 basis points or so for some of the interesting-bearing deposit. So it's more or less coming in line as with our sensitivity tables that we've been working with, maybe a slightly little bit less than what we modeled out. But, again, no real uptick or significant pressure on that.", "Gregory Becker", "The only thing I would add to that is, you can - people forget that there's 2 parts to how we manage our client funds, right? So one is on the balance sheet which is the majority is noninterest-bearing with a little bit of interest-bearing. But when clients are looking for yield, we do have $45-plus billion of off-balance sheet client funds may get a market rate in those - on those. So unlike some banks where they keep everything on balance sheet and they have to figure out how to pay up to make sure they may keep clients given some yield. We have options for them off-balance sheet. So they look at the entire picture about what our clients can get from a yield perspective with their excess cash.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "The private equity and venture capital loans, they're now up to almost half of the overall loan portfolio. Could you give us a sense of how you expect that to keep changing over time? Is it going to go above half? And what - where would you we expect it to level out?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. Currently, we're at 41% of the loan book private equity and venture capital. So that's one part of it. Second part of it is to clarify we need to look at it not just on - just percentage of loan portfolio, but look at it as a percentage of total assets base. That's the second part. And then I'll get you answering your question which is, where do we see it going to from a limit perspective? Right now, we're comfortable in the high 40s approaching 50%. And the more we look at it from a volatility perspective and run our scenarios, it's possible we'll be able to go over 50% less from a risk perspective, more just from a how much of one category do you want in your overall loan portfolio. But I say right now, comfortable levels would be approaching 50%.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris York from JMP Securities.", "Christopher York", "I just have one quick follow-up here. The questions on competition from nonbakes which we've discussed, because I'm curious whether these nonregulated lenders present any opportunities for partnerships, either formally and like a joint venture or informally be first-out structures with some of these nonbanks giving differences in your risk appetite funding and then cost of capital?", "Gregory Becker", "So Chris, it's Greg. I'll start. Yes, we do that to date to a certain extent. And as we think about our outlook on a go-forward basis, clearly, there's an opportunity for us to partner that. We do that in the life science area. We do that in our mezzanine loans. And we can certainly see that broadening that out in a greater way. So yes, that is part of our playbook that we look to use.", "Operator", "This concludes the question-and-answer session. I'd now turn the call over to Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Before we move on to Greg Becker, I want to actually just clarify one question from Chris McGratty from KBW a moment ago. Chris' question was with respect to what is the basis of expenses for 2016 that we would be using when we apply our 2017 expense outlook? Because, again, just to clarify, we did make a reclassification or recasting of our numbers by moving the provision for unfunded credit commitments into the provision for credit losses. As a result, the provision for unfunded credit commitments came out in the expense line item.", "So long story short, the base is the way you look at as we start for 2016, you would take the number from the 2016 10-K of $871 million for expenses for the total year and then you would take out the expenses related to provision for unfunded credit commitments of $11 million which gets you to a net starting point for 2016 of $860 million approximately, of which you would apply that new outlook - expense growth outlook rate. So essentially what you're doing, yes, the expense outlook for 2017 is higher for the reasons we described, but you're also starting from a lower base in 2016. And nonetheless, I just wanted to clarify that for Chris and that was a good question.", "Gregory Becker", "Great. Thanks, Mike. So I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. As we stated, we believe we're off to a solid start in 2017. We've reiterated our expectations for healthy growth this year and obviously, that's regardless of tax reform. We think exit markets are going to be healthier than they are right now, so things will pick up. And obviously, there is upside if we do get some additional rate increases that hasn't been factored into our outlook.", "We wouldn't be able to do without great employees and I just wanted to thank our employees for doing such a great job. We've got phenomenal clients than it's - we get impressed every single day with who they are, what they do. And we're going to do everything in our power to continue to help them succeed. I also want to thank Mike Descheneaux, our CFO, currently CFO, soon moving into President's role. Mike, today will be his 40th earnings call. And if I do my job right and find a CFO in the next 90 days, it will be his last time as a CFO on the earnings call. And I want to thank you for the job over the last 10 years.", "And I'm looking forward to all of the great things he's going to do in the President's role for many years to come. With that, I look forward to speaking everyone next quarter. And have a great evening. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

My name is Sarah, and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]", "Ms. O'Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Sarah. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our second quarter 2014 results. As usual, they will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We will be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. [Operator Instructions]", "And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thank you, Meghan. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. SVB delivered net income of $50.8 million and earnings per share of $1.04, reflecting another quarter of outstanding balance sheet growth, high credit quality and strong new client acquisition.", "Average total client funds grew by $6.5 billion, a 37% increase over the same period last year. Second quarter growth was due to continued healthy funding for our U.S. VC-backed clients, strong new client growth and growth in our global business. Average loans grew by $313 million, and were 23% higher than in the same period last year, driven by our private equity and venture capital clients.", "Core fee income remained healthy, marked by growth in foreign exchange and continued strong credit card volumes, which were 31% and 35% higher, respectively, than 1 year ago. And credit quality remained excellent, with provision for loan losses of just $1.9 million.", "We estimate that losses from our FireEye-related investments reduced second quarter earnings by $0.38 per share, although it's important to note that our total gains from FireEye over the last 2 years have been more than $50 million.", "We are performing well as a result of our focus on the innovation ecosystem, where positive business conditions for our clients continue to support our strong performance, while expanding the broader market opportunity. For example, sources of funding for innovation companies are expanding, capital from angel, seed funds, incubators, crowd sourcing, peer-to-peer funding platforms and successful entrepreneurs, are funding a growing share of early-stage companies, where we've been seeing some participation in late-stage venture grounds from mainstream investment managers.", "Venture-backed funding is expanding. In the second quarter, VC funding reached its highest level since 2001 at $13.9 billion across 974 deals. In the first half of 2014, U.S. VC funding grew to $23.9 billion, a 71% increase over the first half of 2013. And corporate venture capital activity is also flourishing in the U.S. and globally, as established companies trying to avoid being disrupted by investing in new companies with innovative products and delivery models. By some estimates, corporate ventures now constitutes approximately 1/3 of all venture investing.", "In May, I spoke at a conference in London attended by 300 corporate executives representing more than $20 billion in venture assets under management. The view expressed by attendees was that growth in corporate venturing will only continue.", "This collective expansion of capital for entrepreneurial companies has been a significant factor in increasing liquidity for our clients which has, in turn, helped to drive our tremendous deposit growth. Our continued success at winning new clients has also been a factor in deposit growth, since the majority of these new clients are deposit only.", "The second quarter was our best ever, with 1,067 new client wins, nearly triple the quarterly rate of 5 years ago. Another factor of the positive growth has been continued healthy exit markets for our VC-backed companies. There were 28 venture-backed IPOs in the second quarter. 18 of these, or 64%, where SVB client companies. Year-to-date, 59% of all U.S. venture-backed IPOs have been SVB clients.", "As these companies go public, we're winning a significant amount of their IPO proceeds. In short, the level of funding activity for our clients remains healthy for portfolio companies at every stage, private equity and VC investors and corporates.", "Our position as the bank for the global innovation economy continues to develop. Let me highlight a few of these areas that gives me optimism. We're adding clients at a record pace across nearly every segment, as the innovation economy expands. Global loans and deposits now represent 7% and 13% of total balances, respectively. And we expect them to continue growing at a faster pace relative to the rest of our business.", "We expect core fee income growth in the high-teens this year, and we're working on ways to continue driving this growth. Our private bank, which we built to support the key influencers in our ecosystem, is seeing record growth in loan balances and client numbers, along with very positive feedback on our service. And we continue to support our clients through unique, value-add events designed to move their business forward and create meaningful connections that we are well positioned to provide.", "So I'm optimistic we have the right strategy, the right market and we are executing effectively. We do have some challenges, as I've outlined in prior calls. Competition is intensifying. That is affecting our loan income and net interest margin. We expect this very competitive environment to continue so we're making some hard choices about our willingness to adjust loan pricing, size and structure.", "The demands of meeting regulatory requirements are another challenge. We have proactively planned for and invested in infrastructure, people and technology to meet expanding regulatory requirements. We will continue to do so, as we expect both the regulatory bar and costs will continue to rise.", "Finally, let me try to preempt one of the questions I'm sure will be asked on this call, which is with all this new funding activity, higher valuations and more start-ups than ever, are we in a bubble? And if we are, what are we doing about it?", "The short answer is, we don't believe this is a bubble, but the valuations of some companies and a few industries reflect very high expectations. Here's what we're seeing. The pace of new company formations is high and the solutions these new companies are providing are broad-based, so the innovation economy is getting larger, and that's good for all of us.", "Companies today generally have better business models than companies 15 years ago. And most are performing well against revenue and growth targets, which allows them to command higher valuations. So for media and ad tech have experienced some frothiness, mainly due to the large number of companies being funded in this space, combined with high valuations. So-called sharing economy companies such as Uber and Airbnb have also been -- have also seen some impressive valuations, but the potential for this type of company to disrupt and dominate entire industries on a global basis appears to set them apart.", "Likewise, security firms may warrant higher levels of investment and exit activity, as mobile and online businesses become the norm, and as security breaches become more frequent and more public. And despite some frothiness among small-cap biotech companies, mid- and large-cap biotechs appear to be appropriately valued based on their very high growth rates.", "In our view, the innovation economy is thriving, and it's generally the disruptive companies, the best performers and those with the largest market opportunities that are achieving the highest valuations. As always, we remain focused on delivering healthy, high-quality growth regardless of the brighter broader environment. We are disciplined about investing in our business and committed to our strategy through client infrastructure and fee income initiatives. And we believe our talented team of SVB-ers, and the investments we have made to support our growth today will help us to continue growing over the long term.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg. And thank you all for joining us. We delivered a strong quarter of exceptional balance sheet growth, healthy fee income and outstanding credit quality. Our results were driven by continued strong execution of our strategy, and a positive operating environment for our clients, despite intensifying competition.", "I would like to call out a few highlights, which I will cover in more detail shortly. First, solid loan growth; second, exceptional growth in total client funds, which includes on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds; third, higher net interest income, despite a lower net interest margin; fourth, solid fee income with strong growth in foreign exchange fees; and fifth, excellent credit quality. Additionally, I will comment on investment gains and losses, expenses, capital and changes to our 2014 outlook.", "Let me start with loan growth. Please note that these are quarter-over-quarter comparisons except where noted. Average loans grew by $313 million or 2.9% to $11.1 billion during the second quarter. This growth was driven primarily by private equity and venture capital call lines of credit.", "Period-end loan balances grew by $515 million or 4.8% to $11.3 billion, also driven by capital call lines of credit, as well as our private bank. While we view this pace of loan growth as solid, some categories of loans are nevertheless being impacted by the intense competitive dynamic Greg referred to, especially sponsor-led buyouts.", "In addition, we have a growing number of loans that are beginning to mature in our buyout portfolio. While our high velocity client base has always generated relatively high turnover, the dynamics surrounding the competitive environment, coupled with the size of credits could make it somewhat more challenging to replace these high-yielding loans. Nevertheless, our loan growth in the first half of the year, and particularly the first quarter, has been very strong, strong enough that we are increasing our full year outlook for loan growth, which was in the high-teens. We now expect loan growth in 2014 in the high-teens to low-20s.", "Moving to total client funds. We continue to benefit from our strong deposit franchise. Average total client funds, that is on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds, increased by a phenomenal $6.5 billion or 12.8% to $57.3 billion during the second quarter. This tremendous growth was driven by continued strong funding and exit markets for our clients and our continued success at winning new clients.", "Average off-balance sheet client investment funds increased by $3 billion or 11.1% to $30.2 billion, primarily driven by continued growth in client funds managed by SVB Asset Management, due to a healthy IPO and funding environment for our clients. Average deposit balances grew by $3.5 billion or 14.8% to $27.2 billion, primarily driven by our accelerator and private equity clients. Our deposit growth has continued to exceed our expectations, and as a result, we are increasing our outlook for average deposit growth for the full year 2014. We now expect deposits to increase at a percentage rate in the low-40s compared to our previous outlook of the high-20s.", "Moving to net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $8.6 million or 4.4% to $205.4 million in the second quarter, driven by a significant increase in the average balances of our fixed income investment securities portfolio. Average balances of fixed income securities, which includes available-for-sale securities and healthy maturity securities, increased by $2.9 billion or 24% to $15.2 billion, resulting in an increase of $9 million in interest income in the second quarter.", "Period-end balances increased by $4.3 billion or 33% to $17.1 billion. Both the average and period-end increases were due to the deployment of excess deposits, which grew significantly. Overall, yields on our fixed income portfolio decreased by 13 basis points to 1.71%, primarily due to lower reinvestment yields on new investments made during the quarter, the impact of which was offset somewhat by lower premium amortization expense. We added new investments of $4.5 billion including $4.2 billion of U.S. treasuries, with the remainder in agency issued mortgage securities, as part of our continued focus on limiting our duration risk. The duration of our fixed income investment securities portfolio was 3.1 years in the second quarter compared to 3.3 years in the first quarter.", "During the second quarter, we redesignated $5.4 billion in available-for-sale securities as held-to-maturity. We expect that this change will help mitigate the potential impact on tangible book value of an increasing interest rate environment.", "Interest income from loans decreased slightly by $492,000 to $147.7 million, driven by lower loan prepayment fees recognized in Q2 compared to Q1, which included $2.1 million in prepayments related to a single client. This decrease was partially offset by loan growth and one additional day in the quarter. Overall loan yields declined by 23 basis points from 5.8 -- excuse me, 5.58% to 5.35%.", "Our ability to grow loans has historically driven higher overall net interest income, but we expect loan mix, competition and the low rate environment to continue to pressure loan yields moving forward. In addition, as I mentioned, we are starting to see turnover in our sponsor-led buyout portfolio, due to maturities, which affects loan income, growth and yield.", "Nevertheless, we are increasing our outlook for net interest income for the full year 2014, due primarily to the impact of our exceptional deposit growth on our investment securities portfolio. We now expect net interest income to increase at a percentage rate in the low 20s compared to our prior outlook of the high-teens.", "Moving to net interest margin. Net interest margin was 2.79% compared to 3.13% in the first quarter, which represents a decline of 34 basis points. The decline was largely driven by the significant inflow deposits deployed into our investment securities portfolio, and to a lesser extent, by changing loan mix and the competitive low rate environment.", "While we expect continued loan growth to partially offset pressure on our net interest margin, as a result of this factor, we are lowering our net interest margin outlook for the full year 2014 to a range of between 2.75% to 2.85%. This compares to our prior range of 3.1% to 3.2%.", "Now turning to credit quality. It remained excellent during the second quarter, marked by lower net charge-offs and continued positive underlying credit trends. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $1.9 million compared to $494,000 in the first quarter, albeit both are exceptionally low. Net charge-offs were $4.8 million or 17 basis points reflecting $6.4 million of gross charge-offs, primarily related to early-stage loans in the software portfolio.", "Our loans for -- our allowance for loan losses declined, due to the continued strong performance of our loan portfolio. The allowance for performing loans was 1.02% compared to 1.07% in the first quarter. Nonperforming loans decreased by $2.6 million to $22.4 million compared to $25.1 million in the first quarter when we resolve certain previously impaired loans. At 20 basis points of total gross loans, nonperforming loans are well below our 5-year average of 66 basis points and are at their lowest levels since Q3 2008. Likewise, criticized loans, at 5.5% of gross loans, are near their all-time low of 5.2%.", "Now let us move to noninterest income. Non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $49.5 million compared to $123.5 million in the first quarter. That decline was primarily driven by private equity and venture capital related investment losses of $22.1 million, net of noncontrolling interests. The majority of which were due to our FireEye-related investments.", "And to reiterate Greg's earlier comments, our FireEye related investments have performed extremely well with aggregate warrants and investment securities gains net of noncontrolling interest of more than $50 million over the life of the investment.", "Notwithstanding FireEye's impact in the second quarter, the positive overall investment and exit trends that have benefited our investment securities and warrant portfolios in prior quarters continued. The highlights of the quarter included: gains of $11.6 million on the remaining portion of our PE and VC-related investment securities portfolio; and gains on derivative instruments of $12.8 million, primarily driven by equity warrants. We also had slightly lower core fee income of $50 million, but it was still underpinned by stronger foreign exchange income and healthy credit card activity.", "Net investment securities losses from FireEye totaled $30.4 million in the second quarter. This number reflects an unrealized loss of $16.4 million from our managed direct venture funds, and a $14 million realized loss from the sale of all of our warrant-related FireEye shares, both due to decreases in FireEye stock price during the second quarter.", "At June 30, our managed funds still had exposure to FireEye shares. We estimate, based on their levels of exposure at June 30, that the impact of a $1 change in FireEye stock price would equate to a $1 million valuation change net of noncontrolling interests. To be clear, this is an approximation, and of course, it can vary.", "The gains on the remaining portion of our investment securities portfolio were primarily due to strong distributions and increases in valuations. Gains on equity warrants were $12.3 million in the second quarter, due to increases in private and public company valuations. This compares to $25.4 million in the first quarter, which benefited from $15.2 million in warrant gains related to FireEye.", "Now I will move on to core fee income. Core fee income remained healthy, with a solid performance in credit cards and foreign exchange, despite a decrease of $1 million in the second quarter to $50 million. The decline was primarily driven by a $1.3 million decrease in letter-of-credit fees due to a onetime fee adjustment, lower fees from syndicated lending, although deal volume was higher, and higher expenses related to our card rewards program.", "As a reminder, core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards and letters of credit, deposit service charges, lending-related fees and client investment fees. Foreign exchange fees remained strong, increasing by $732,000 to $17.9 million due to strong growth in transaction volumes, despite a seasonally strong first quarter.", "Revenue from credit cards was essentially flat quarter-over-quarter at $10.2 million, reflecting volume increases offset by higher reward expense as previously mentioned. But it is important to point out that gross revenues from credit cards increased by approximately 10%, reflecting our continued focus on penetrating and expanding our clients' use of cards.", "Total card revenues were 35% higher than the same quarter last year and transactions increased by 28% in the same period. As a result of continued healthy momentum in fees from foreign exchange and cards, we are increasing our full year 2014 outlook for core fee income growth to the high-teens compared to our prior outlook of the low-teens.", "Now turning to expenses. Noninterest expense increased by $1 million to $173.4 million, primarily due to an increase in the provision for unfunded credit commitments, and higher FDIC expense related to asset growth. These increases were largely offset by lower compensation and benefits expense, primarily due to seasonally higher first quarter expenses, and lower incentive compensation related to FireEye due to valuation decreases in the second quarter. While we are maintaining our current full year outlook of expense growth in the low-double-digits, we expect to come in at the high end of that range and could increase it if continued strong performance drives better-than-expected results.", "Moving on to capital. Growth in our core earnings continued to increase our capital base, and our capital ratios remained strong, and were further supported by our capital raise in May. In particular, our bank-level, Tier 1 leverage ratio, which has been impacted by strong deposit growth, increased by 79 basis points in the second quarter, to 7.51%. Tier 1 leverage at the holding company increased by 75 basis points to 8.74%, and our total risk-based capital ratio at the holding company increased by 195 basis points, to a very strong 15.36%.", "Looking ahead, we expect our capital raise and earnings to support a significant amount of deposit growth and continue to target a bank-level, Tier 1 leverage ratio of between 7% and 8%. However, given our increased outlook on deposit growth, we will continue to closely monitor the leverage ratio, to ensure we are well-positioned to support our future growth.", "In closing, we delivered strong results in the second quarter, and are well positioned as we move into the second half of the year. We have raised our full year 2014 outlook for loans, deposits, net interest income and core fee income due to healthy growth in the innovation economy, positive business conditions for our clients and our continued solid execution.", "While the rate environment remains uncertain, we are not waiting for rising rates in order to grow. We continue to add new clients, grow interest, earning assets, building core fee income and delivering solid performance. Competition remains intense and we are taking a measured approach where we feel it is warranted. However, we still see opportunities regardless of these challenges.", "Thank you. And now I'd like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Merrill Lynch.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So I guess just a quick question in terms of deposit growth. I'm just wondering, what's visibility in terms of any look at the second half of the year, in terms of your guidance relative to the strength that you've seen in activity? And I guess it's a good problem to have, but the risk of deposit growth surpassing your expectations and the bank and leverage ratio trending closer to 7% as we sort of get closer to the end of the year. Is that a reasonable concern? Or you think it's a stretch that we get anywhere close to that?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "This is Mike. It's obviously a real challenge to get visibility. And to your point, it is a high-quality problem to have. I mean, as you step back and look at the increasing sources of funds going into the VC environment, again, we continue to exceed expectations on this deposit growth. So I would admit that it is tough to see, to see that level of growth. But obviously, when we're talking about deposit growth, a lot about what we talk about is average growth. So being halfway through the year, you can pretty much get some visibility on some of the numbers, but clearly, you can have some upside surprises to the upside. But naturally, you also want to keep aware on how the general economy is going, how the general VC funding markets are going, because obviously, it could change. But nonetheless, what we see as of June 30, it certainly looks extremely strong.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Ebrahim, this is Greg. Let me just add on to it. When you look at the first half of the year, in fundings, right, you had about 9 -- a little more than $9 billion, almost $10 billion in the first quarter of venture capital activity, $13.9 billion in the second quarter. So like $24 billion for the first half. My view is, that number in the second quarter is not going to be repeated. It could be. But I just think it's going to slow down a little bit there and for the second -- fourth quarter as well. So I think you'll see some tapering. Obviously, we still expect to see growth in the second half, but I don't think it will be in the same level we saw in Q2.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And I guess my second question is, just in terms of, Greg, if you can talk about, obviously, we see the FTE headcount again went up and has been growing over the last several quarters, just in terms of how -- what the hiring outlook is? Where we've been hiring and competitive pressures in terms of competitors taking talent from SVB?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So on the headcount, yes, it has been growing. But remember, we've got a lot of different initiatives that are not only just supporting the growth that we're having. We're continuing to invest for the future growth. What I mean by that is just take global as an example. We're adding people in the U.K., we're adding people in China. And part of this is to support the growth that we have, but also we want to hire ahead of what growth opportunities we're going to have in the next 6 months, 9 months, 12 months. We need to get those people trained, up to speed, and ready to go and ready to perform. So that's one example. But we're also bringing it in, in operations. We're bringing it in, in IT. We're bring it in, in front-line sales support, client service. Again, we have a huge growth engine here, and we need to make sure we were supporting that. Regulatory side is part of that, but we've been hiring in that area for quite a while. So it's pretty broad-based and it's not just one area.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Greg, you've highlighted the increased competition that you're seeing. Can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of pricing and structure and kind of what are you seeing that would cause you to step back from a deal?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So Aaron, I'll start, then Marc Cadieux may want to add something to it. So it's really -- what's great about our business is that we have a lot of different growth opportunity. So it's not just one area. If it's just one area, I'd be more concerned, but you've got -- we got growth opportunities in global. You have growth opportunities in the private bank, and buyout financing in the growth stage and later stage. So what you're seeing in certain areas, such as our buyout financing, right, multiples are being pushed up from a leverage perspective. And we've been pretty disciplined about where we want to play and where we don't want to play. So when you start seeing leverage multiples above 4.5x, 5x, we start to ask ourselves the question is this company unique enough to really say to us that it justifies that higher leverage ratio. So it's both pricing we're seeing some pressure, and again, we're willing to move on that for the right company. You're looking at size of deal and you're looking at structure. And we're seeing, I guess, competition in kind of all 3 of those areas. That being said, you've got to remember, we still had growth during the quarter. We still expect to see growth for the balance of the year, but that's mainly because we have this -- a bunch of growth targets we're going after, not just one area. So lots of opportunities for us. It's just, we're being more selective in which ones we're picking and choosing to be more aggressive. I don't know, Marc, if you have any...", "Marc C. Cadieux", "It's Marc Cadieux. And I think you hit all the highlights. There's nothing to add.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "That, I guess, leads in to my second question, is on the international front, can you give us an update on kind of where balances are, I guess, in both loans and deposits coming out of London, that office? And then also, what the latest is in the joint venture with Shanghai Pudong, and when we can expect to here some more news coming from there?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So at a high level, I'm talking about global overall, and so it's kind of all the global businesses, both the -- what we're doing in Asia, at SVB, not the joint venture yet, what you're seeing in Europe and you add all those things together, you're looking at ballpark $900 million of loan outstandings collectively. And what we've seen a lot of growth in is the deposit side, from a global perspective. We were just over $4 billion, a little bit less than that at the end of the quarter. So that has grown significantly, right? And it's both because of new client count, and similar to the U.S., you're seeing the average funding size increase as well. So we feel really good. I feel really good about what's happening from a global perspective. Now let's talk about the joint venture. I'd say the short answer is, not a lot has changed. As everyone knows the big driver of a change in growth is going to be us getting our RMB license in the joint venture. Three years , which is the kind of the minimum time frame set to submit a request to get the RMB license, will be kind of the middle of 2015. We are hopeful, still remain a little hopeful, we'll get that license earlier, but let's just say we get it at that point. That's really going to be the first point when you start to see a growth in material balances in the joint venture. So between here and there or right now, the balances are pretty nominal. You're looking at balances below $100 million both in deposits and clearly a lot less than that on the lending side. So our outlook hasn't changed. Very excited about it long term, but it still is a long-term proposition.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "On the competition front, could you help us a little bit with how to think about the yields that you're bringing on some of the loans onto the book, some of the new production yields, by portfolio? I know you mentioned that certain portfolios, like the buy-out portfolio, is a higher yielding book and then obviously, the capital call line book is probably a lower yielding book. So can you give us some color on where the new production yields are now?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. I'll talk at a very high-level and I'll let Marc add to it. So private equity loans, you're looking at loans at prime or a little bit less than prime. I'd say, on average, when you look at that being brought on board. The buyout financing is you're looking at kind of the LIBOR plus 400 to 450, in that range generally or a little bit less than that depending upon, again, the quality of company. And again, that's where historically we've seen more of the growth, but this quarter, as Mike articulated, it's been mainly in private equity, which is where you saw or why you saw the more dramatic decline in loan margin and net interest income. But again, that was driven by deposits as well. So that's been the biggest catalyst. I'll let Marc add a little more color to some of the other areas.", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Yes. So I would add to that in our private bank, we tend to see average interests -- interest-only yields in the low-3% rate. In early-stage to the mid-stage companies, early-stage tends to be one of the better ones in the mid-5% range. You get into the mid-stage or growth stage, and that tends to be in the mid-4s, low- to mid-4s and that gets us to an average yield across the portfolio that's in the mid-4s.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then separately on the expense side, I know you mentioned that you've been investing, as you go along, in terms of regulatory compliance infrastructure. But just given the pace of growth here and given your asset level, and you still got a little ways before you get to $50 billion obviously, but here around $30 billion, and given your pace of growth I'm sure, there's a real emphasis around making sure you're up to snuff there, particularly given what you're seeing other banks are doing. So can you really give us a little bit more color on the pace of investment, and have you ramped that up significantly here, as your pace of growth is staying brisk?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, John. So I'd say one of the advantages that we've had is when we look at our business, you've got a global aspect of it. You've got a private banking aspect of it. You have a broad-based business line. So given that fact, we've been building out infrastructure around compliance in the regulatory side for quite a while. And so, even getting prepared for what I would say the stress test and things like that, years in advance of where we need to be. So from that standpoint, we've been building in expenses, regulatory resources, compliance resources for a while. That being said as, I said in the call, there's no question the bar is getting raised and we're spending time going through and saying what are we going to need to do to get to the $50 billion level. Now although we're thinking about that, we're talking about that, I think it's really important, from our standpoint, that it's not right in front of us. We do have some time to prepare for that, and again, even though we're preparing for it, there's still more work to be done. And I think one of the other drivers is that one of the big things that when rates do finally pick up, and again, when is that -- you can look right now, it's probably, the consensus would be second quarter of next year, ballpark, that's going to give us some more leverage to direct appropriately for our clients more of those deposits off the balance sheet to investment funds. And that is going to slow the overall balance sheet growth. That being said, over time, clearly, we expect to achieve kind of $50 billion at some point and we need to be prepared for that, but we're getting ready and we've been investing in that business for a while.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Great. If I just ask one more quick thing. On what you just said there, with the higher rates, have you put out an updated number on how much in deposits could move off the balance sheet as rate -- once rates rise, under a certain scenario?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "John, it's Mike. So actually, we have never put out a number about that. So no, there's no update. But when we think about it though, we have to, in our minds, be prepared for large amounts going off. Not to say that they will, but again, if that's one of the reflections of our investment securities portfolio why we maintain such a highly liquid portfolio, is in order to be prepared for that.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to start and follow-up on Mike's prepared comments regarding the potential drag from the sponsor-led buyout loans. Mike, what's the balance of those loans maturing in the second half? And what's your estimate of what could run off?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Steve, that's a hard one to answer at this point because a fair amount of those will also be in a competitive situation, where they essentially were mature, that we're taking out. But maybe to put it in a little bit of perspective, and we had a little bit over $2 billion of loans at the end of last quarter or the first quarter, so to speak, and the average balances were about down almost $200 million this quarter. So as Marc Cadieux and Greg were talking about, those tend to yield around a 5%, 5.25%, so the effect of a $200 million drag, at least in this quarter was certainly noticeable, but as far as the number going forward, I won't have that for you at this point.", "Gregory W. Becker", "And Steve, the only thing I would add on to that, from the standpoint of what's maturing. The second quarter, as Mike said, was a couple of hundred million dollars of a decline. My view is that is not something you would expect to see on a go-forward basis on a quarterly basis. So it could be flat, it could be up. The pipeline is still strong. I'll tell you the number of opportunities that we have is still significant and you're also starting to see more of these opportunities be global, especially in the U.K. and in Europe. So again, to me it's important, the number of opportunities are significant. And if we choose not to grow that business, it's more because we don't believe the return and the structure of those loans are appropriate. So I wouldn't read personally too much into the second quarter decline. I think that's a little more of an anomaly, so we expect to see that back to either flat or some growth in the future quarters.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Greg, can you talk about where this increased competition is coming from? Is this larger banks? Are they new entrants into your space? What's going on there?", "Gregory W. Becker", "The answer is yes. So it is across the board. As we've said before, I mean, quite honestly for the last 2 to 4 years, is we're in a market that is a very coveted market. It's growing at a very fast pace. You're seeing companies with lots of liquidity. They are users of fee income. And so the pie is getting bigger. And so as we look at this, although it's maybe frustrating, it's not surprising to us. And what we've been building for the last several years is a product set and a network and knowledge solutions set that basically is going to be competitive, where people want to come to and clients are going to get advantages they can't get any other place. And that's what we've worked on and that's what we continue to work on. So even though there is a competitive landscape out there that is intensifying, I would tell you that the amount of deals we're winning and the feedback we're getting from clients and venture capitalists and investors is still incredibly positive. So we are seeing it from larger banks. We're seeing it from nonbanks. We're seeing it from a variety of different areas. And again, that's not a surprise.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe just one final one, regarding the 71% increase you cited in VC funding in the first half. What's your take in terms of what's driving such strong inflows year-over-year, right? Corporate VC is a factor, but $14 billion applies traditional VCs putting a lot more cash to work. And is that carrying into the next third quarter of the year?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So I mean, second quarter, honestly, I was surprised a little bit by the level that it was at. I mean, I thought the first quarter was obviously strong at roughly $10 billion. But going back to this -- and that's why I wanted to answer the question, preemptively, about the bubble. What you're seeing here, and I want to reiterate, the company's performances that we're seeing with these growth stage and later stage companies is incredible. I mean, it's the best performance that I've seen, highest growth is collectively in my 21 years at the bank. And I think those companies when they're starting to hit revenue targets and they're being as disruptive as they are, are going to command higher valuations. The higher the valuation if you want a certain amount of ownership in these companies, you're going to but a lot more money to work in these companies. So we're seeing, on a regular basis, rounds of financing for private companies that are $30 million, $40 million, $50 million, $60 million, $70 million on a regular basis. That's something we haven't seen -- I haven't -- I actually have never seen that consistent number of companies raising that level of capital. And it's for growth, it's for acquisitions. And there are -- a lot of these companies are just keeping it on their balance sheet for liquidity. Essentially, one of the reasons why we haven't seen this much loan growth in the corporate finance area is because that market is so liquid. And -- so they have so much liquidity and they're asking themselves, why would they want to borrow money even at today's interest rates for doing acquisitions or anything else. They're just using cash to finance it.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I was curious I guess, Mike, if you could talk a little bit more about the key drivers to the increased guidance on the fee income side from low-teens to high-teens, partly since the core was down in the quarter? Is it really just the credit cards and FX or with the growth you're seeing off balance sheet? Is it client investment fees? Or it also looks like maybe the other category was low. Was there something unusual there?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Essentially 3 things that we're describing. Absolutely, foreign exchange fees are driving that. Again, they've been having another record quarter and just continue to perform extremely well. Then you look at the card fees. Now whilst it looks flat in the quarter, actually gross volumes were up, there was a little bit of a change in estimate on the rewards area, which maybe held back the revenue growth a little bit. But again, we don't view that as a, what's the word, to continuing on. So, in other words, we should see next quarter probably be back up again. So again, see good traction FX and credit cards are the primary drivers for sure. And then on the line of credits, as well, as we mentioned, we had a onetime adjustment as well. Again, not a sustainable item. So I think it's just a little bit of noise there, but again, you back that out, again, you would actually see some good growth in that core fee income. So that's why we're raising the guidance for the rest of the year.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then on the margin, the -- I mean, the quarter -- the margin for the quarter came in not much above the low end of your guidance going forward. Is that just because going forward you think -- seeing benefits from remixing of the earning assets? Or was some of the growth more late in the quarter in terms of the loans?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Part of that, as you also -- again, a higher number in the first quarter, right. So the effect of that -- so remember, when we talk about net interest margin, we're talking about a full year effect. So it's partly that, but then it's also about continuing to grow the loan portfolio as well, which has a nice health as well. And then even potentially bringing down some of the cash levels as well.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.", "Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I just had a question about the outlook for the allowance that you say is comparable to 2013. It looks like, by any measure, the first half of the year, credit costs were very low. Allowance came down quite a bit. So to be anywhere in the ballpark of 2013 would suggest a pretty outsized provisioning back half of the year relative to what you're credit quality is right now. Could you talk about that?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I'll take the first avenue. Comparable has a wide range and wide net, I would say. And the candid answer to you right away is we're not anticipating any significant changes in our trends. Now we did say that these are extraordinarily low credit performing levels, but again, we'll probably see our net charge-offs revert back to a more normal levels, which we've experienced in the past kind of 40 to 50 basis points. So don't read anything into it that we're expecting something big or disastrous in the second half of the year. Again, just recognize that comparable has a wide net.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I know you addressed this in your prepared remarks a little bit, but I was hoping that maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the comparison between today's business models in the innovation economy space and those of 14 to 15 years ago. Because obviously, that period, the '99, 2000 kind of period, I think is what everybody kind of remembers as a touchstone when they're trying to evaluate the frothiness or lack thereof of today's environment. So I'm curious, I mean, are the business models you're seeing fundamentally more sound? Is it easier or harder to take a concept from the draft room to taking it public? Are banks like yours approaching these new companies differently than they would have 14, 15 years ago?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. Gaston, this is Greg. There's a few things that I would say are different. One is the overall cost to get a company started is a lot -- a lot less. So on -- I would say, a relatively small amount of money, these companies can get formed, funded, with a little bit of money, and all of a sudden, hit revenue relatively early. And being back here in '99 -- I mean, '99, 2000, I mean, it would take a fair amount of money. And they would say, \"Okay, we're going to raise $20 million, $30 million, $40 million. And we're going to build something,\" and the valuation would be high, and they also wouldn't have any revenue yet. So when you're either lending money in that scenario or if the market turns down and the money goes away from an equity perspective, so people aren't willing to invest in these businesses, there's nothing left in the business, right. So the business goes away. What -- my view is, of the business models today, again, as they get -- revenue picks up, they get further along. Now the valuation may come down as the market corrects, but the company that's generating revenue is still going to have a value in general, and that's a big distinction. I mean a huge distinction from what it was a long time ago. And the costs, again, to go global are a lot less. The cost to just build the business. So from that standpoint, I think that's the biggest fundamental change from what we've seen today. The second part -- and again, with companies in the Internet space and social, et cetera, the revenue growth that they're having, I just can't recall growth as broad based -- you'd have seen some companies back in '99, 2000, that would see substantial revenue growth, but this is a much more broad based growth in revenue that what we're seeing today. So I think those 2 things are really what's driving different business models or our comfort today being higher than it was back then.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka with KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I have a question. Kind of thinking about, when is the rates rise sometime next year? Kind of thinking about the pace of growth that you have seen. When you think about your deposits potentially flowing off-balance sheet in a higher rate environment, are you thinking more realistically that simply your deposit -- net deposit growth on balance sheet will slow down, but you won't necessarily see a negative balance sheet deposit growth trend? Or do you think given how fast your deposits have grown, we might actually have to start thinking about negative deposit growth on-balance sheet, which would not be necessarily negative for profitability?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, Julianna this is Greg. So part of this depends upon what sort of rate increases you're seeing, and if it's one question, how fast it picks back up? If it's a gradual interest rate growth, so you look at 25 basis points here or there in a given quarter. I think it's going to be slow enough that, here's my view is, you're still going to see some deposit growth, but it's going to be a much, much slower level. And again, assuming that the funding environment is still relatively stable and general from where it is today. If you start to see a more material pickup, then it's going to be what we decide, I would say, mainly what we decide to do from an interest rate perspective, and what we want to pay on the balance sheet. And that's something we have models about and been thinking about, but we haven't communicated, I guess, externally yet, as far as what we think would happen to those rates. That's something -- as we get closer to that, clearly, we'll be articulating to you and other investors, and so we can lay that out there. But it's still far enough away right now, that we're not ready to kind of be public and open about what our plans are, what we think is going to happen.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And to follow-up on that, to ask the other side of that question. When thinking about your loan growth, one could say that some of the momentum to your loan growth could be driven by the ready availability of cheap money for VCs et cetera. So as you think about rising rates, do you think about any of your growth segments as having a potential reaction stronger or less strong in react -- in response to rates?", "Gregory W. Becker", "I think -- again, it almost, it goes back to the same question before, with deposit rates. If you're going to see a few -- 25 basis points here or there, I don't think you're going to at least see a lot of behavioral changes, from a -- whether they're going to borrow or not. I actually think that part of it is going to be what happens to the overall economy once you start to see interest rates starting to rise. Because right now, if you could see a scenario, rates start to pick back up, the funding environment starts to slow down, because there's a question about where the economy is a little bit. And if that happens, you could actually see some more borrowings, as people start to think about free money, free new equity isn't as available, therefore we want to borrow some money to do finance acquisitions. We're going to borrow money to finance working capital. So our utilization rates, over the last several quarters, have actually gone down. If you start to see rates pick back up, you can start to see utilization rates grow as well.", "Operator", "And at this time, there are no further questions. I will turn the call back to Mr. Greg Becker for closing comments.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great. Thanks. Just a few comments in closing. I just want to reiterate our -- the success we're having and the growth that we're having in our deposits and loans and fee income, et cetera, it's really a combination of a couple of things that are all about our strategy. Number one, we're executing our strategy to be the bank of the global innovation economy. But secondly, we're fortunate. We're in a market that is absolutely thriving on almost every level. So it's great to be here. We're not taking it for granted. We're continuing to invest in our business for the long term, and we want to continue to see that growth continue.", "I just want to thank all the SVB-ers for doing such a great job of taking care of our clients, and helping us deliver the results. And also for our clients in trusting us, and giving us the faith, and being a great partner.", "So thanks for joining us today.

(Operator Instructions) Ms O\u2019Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Today, Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO and Michael Descheneaux, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss SVB Financial Group\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end 2007 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of our management team will be available to take your questions. I\u2019d like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure.", "This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including, without limitation, financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2008. Forward-looking statements are just statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are just predictions and actual events or results may differ materially. ", "The information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking statements is provided in our press release and our last filed Form 10-Q. The forward-looking statements are made as of the date of broadcast and the company undertakes no obligation to update such forward-looking statements. ", "This presentation may also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure can be found in our press release. Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you, Meghan. Good afternoon to all and thank you all for joining us. By now you should have seen the press release and as you can see we had another excellent quarter to cap off an outstanding year. Not many banks can say that about 2007. ", "We delivered strong earnings per share of $0.96 for the quarter and $3.37 for the year. That\u2019s an increase of 42% over 2006. We realized net income of $34.3 million in the fourth quarter and $123.6 million for the full year 2007. That\u2019s a 38% increase over 2006. ", "Our performance on the metrics by which we have guided you throughout 2007 has been exactly on target in most cases. Most notably we met our targets for loan growth in excess of 20% and client investment fund growth in the high teens. We expected flat deposit levels and did far better than our expectations. ", "We maintained high credit quality, saw solid fee income growth, and achieved a net interest margin that, while somewhat lower than in 2006, is still more than double that of most banks. And while non-interest expense was somewhat higher in 2007 than our target owing in large part to better-than-expected performance, we have nonetheless instituted meaningful discipline around expense control and improved our operating leverage.", "We\u2019ve had a number of other successes in the past year and I want to touch on just a few of them. We introduced two new products that garnered over $400 million in new deposits. We closed two new investment funds including one in India, growing our family of funds by over $300 million. ", "We built our fledgling valuation services company, SVB Analytics, into the de facto leader in that growing industry. And we successfully launched an initiative to increase the business we do with larger companies and private equity firms, capitalizing on the enhancements we\u2019ve made to our product offering in recent years to drive revenue growth. We accomplished all of this and we did it during one of the worst years the financial services industry has had in recent times.", "This was no accident. Our performance in 2007 was a result of our deliberate intention and discipline as embodied by five factors: one, people; two, the strength of the innovations sector; three, our growing fee-based business; four, a solid and strengthening expense culture, and five, our well-established culture of credit discipline.", "Let\u2019s start with people, specifically, the right people. We have taken pains in recent years to develop and recruit the very best people to assume key sales, support, and leadership roles across the company. The team we have at SVB today is the strongest team we\u2019ve ever had and their efforts and abilities are what enable us to succeed.", "Another factor in our success is the strength of the markets we serve, collectively known as the innovations sector. The innovations sector has shown itself over time to be strongly resilient to negative market conditions. In fact, although the US economy ended 2007 on the verge of a recession, venture investment in the US grew 8% during that time to $30 billion, despite turmoil in the markets. ", "That\u2019s because venture capital firms are investing with a return horizon of eight to ten years so they are not necessarily inhibited by negative market cycles, especially in the short term. What\u2019s more, venture firms raised far more money last year than they invested. As a result of this dynamic, we at SVB have typically had a steady stream of new clients and ready access to new client funds. Moving into 2008, we have that as well as the reassurance of ample dry powder.", "Over the last few years we have parlayed this steady stream of emerging company clients and the changing needs of larger companies into a new, diversified income stream that constitutes an ever larger share of our revenues. That\u2019s been another factor in our success. That preparation allowed us to grow volumes strongly across multiple business lines during the year that for most financial services companies was consumed with subprime issues. ", "And while Mike will give you the specifics on our outlook for 2008, I\u2019ll tell you that we are forecasting continued volume growth in all the areas over which we have control; that is loans, deposits, and fee income.", "As we\u2019ve grown our income streams on both the non-interest and interest sides, we have also begun to improve our operating leverage through more effective expense control. We are justifiably proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished here. In less than a year we\u2019ve gone from having very few meaningful expense controls to creating a culture of cost control and efficiency.", "Through our five initiatives of process improvement, a universal banking system, vendor management, multi-sourcing, and continual optimistic expense cutting, we\u2019ve made tremendous progress toward our goal of reducing expense growth by half. We plan to maintain our focus on this goal in 2008.", "Our credit culture is the last factor in our success I\u2019d like to touch on. It\u2019s a discipline we\u2019ve built over time and our approach can be summed up in a few sentences. We lend to industries we know well. We have a deep understanding of the business models of our clients and the factors that drive their behavior. ", "We focused exclusively on a small number of industries and a large number of the people we work with we\u2019ve worked with before. Our long experience through market cycles in our target markets allows us to differentiate between real and perceived risk. It\u2019s a discipline, one we\u2019ve learned the hard way and from which we do not deviate no matter how exciting the markets get. ", "And as our credit quality over the last decade demonstrates, this approach works. I know many of you were skeptical in February when we said we\u2019d cut expense growth, increase deposits, and set and meet specifics performance metrics. But we did that and more in 2007.", "Moving into 2008, we expect to continue to meet the commitments we\u2019ve made to our stockholders, especially with regard to volume growth and operating leverage. We feel confident in our ability to do this because we have served our core industries for 25 years. ", "We\u2019ve weathered market cycles with our venture and technology clients. And we\u2019ve applied the lessons we learned from that experience to improving our focus and discipline and to being better at serving the innovations sector than any other company out there. And while other banks are distracted by credit quality issues, as we move into 2008, we are focused on growth and creating shareholder value. ", "We are in a strong position. We know exactly what we need to do in the coming year to accomplish our goals. From a broad economic perspective, the year ahead may be a difficult one for many people but we expect it will also be another good year for SVB. Thank you.", "And now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Descheneaux, who will discuss our fourth quarter and our 2007 results.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Ken, and thank you everyone for joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2007 financial results and our outlook for 2008. ", "Despite challenges in the broader economy and significant interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, our earnings remain strong. As Ken noted we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.96 and net income of $34.3 million in the fourth quarter. ", "For the full year 2007, diluted earnings per share were $3.37 and net income was $123.6 million, which includes a pre-tax charge of $17.2 million related to goodwill impairment in the third quarter. This represents an increase of $0.99 or 42% in earnings per share and $34.2 million or 38% in net income over 2006. We believe it is safe to say that very few financial institutions achieved such impressive results in 2007. ", "Overall our results for the fourth quarter in 2007 demonstrate the strength of our core markets. There are five areas I would like to highlight with respect to our fourth quarter 2007 results. ", "First, loans, we grew our average loan balances in Q4 3.8% or 16.1% annualized to $3.8 billion. For the full year 2007 we grew our average loan balances 22%. You\u2019ll also note that our Q4 period end balances grew $330 million to $4.1 billion from Q3 levels.", "Second, deposits, deposits were strong in Q4. We grew average deposits 6.9% or 30.6% annualized in Q4 to $4.2 billion. This increase resulted from elevated end-of-year activity among our private equity clients and the impact of two new deposit products we introduced in mid to late 2007. Our period end deposit balances at Q4 also increased significantly to $4.6 billion from $4 billion at the end of Q3.", "Third, non-interest income, non-interest income remained at solid levels in Q4. We had great Q4 growth of $3.1 million or 11.7% in our core, fee-based products, which includes client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, deposit services, charges and letter of credit income.", "Fourth, non-interest expense, our better than expected financial performance and unfunded loan growth caused non-interest expenses to be higher than expected in Q4. Specifically, we had higher than expected incentive compensation expenses and an increased provision for unfunded credit commitments related to strong growth. ", "Although we exceeded our 5% expense growth goal for the year, we are pleased that we improved our operating leverage from 61.6% in 2006 to 56.2% in 2007. We are committed to continued expense control and it will remain a high priority in 2008.", "Fifth, credit quality, credit quality remained excellent Q4. We experienced low levels of net charge-offs, which totaled $2.9 million in Q4, comparable to Q3 levels. Our loan provision increased by $2.8 million compared to Q3 due to the increase in the size of our loan portfolio, not as a result of any credit issues.", "Let\u2019s discuss some specifics regarding our fourth quarter results. We increased our net interest income to $97.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $95.7 million in the third quarter of 2007 despite the effect of the 100 basis point decrease in the Fed funds rate in 2007. ", "The rise in net interest income was primarily due to increased average loan balances, which we grew by $138 million during the fourth quarter. This growth was driven primarily by loans to our technology clients. Additionally, we benefited from an increase in loan prepayments in Q4 which added $2.3 million in loan fee income. ", "Our success in growing deposits also added to net interest income in Q4 by increasing short-term investment income and reducing our short-term borrowing needs and costs. Our net interest margin was 7.04% in the fourth quarter compared to 7.18% in the third quarter. Although our net interest margin is still roughly twice that of the average bank in the United States, we expect lower interest rates to reduce our net interest margin moving forward.", "Let us turn our attention to deposits. We continue to make significant progress in growing our deposits. We grew average deposits by $270 million in the fourth quarter to $4.2 billion, which as I pointed out, reflects an increase of 6.9% or 30.6% annualized. ", "This increase reflects the impact of the money market deposit account for early stage companies we introduced in May and the Eurodollar Sweep product we rolled out at the end of October. Together, those two products added $190 million to average deposit balances in the fourth quarter.", "Demand deposit balances also grew in the fourth quarter by $73 million or 2.6%, which represents annualized growth of 10.8%. For the entire year, average demand deposits grew $78 million or 2.8%. We are pleased with the success we have had in attracting new deposits to the balance sheet and look to further increases in 2008. Additionally, we expect to introduce at least two more new deposit products in 2008 to help us grow our deposit base.", "Non-interest income decreased in the fourth quarter by $11.8 million to $53.2 million. At first glance this decrease may seem significant but when you consider non-interest income net of minority interest, you see that our non-interest income remained strong in the fourth quarter. ", "Although they are non-GAAP measures, we believe non-interest income net of minority interests and gains on investment securities, net of minority interests, are relevant to the understanding our results attributable to our ownership percentages.", "As some of you may know, we recognize income and losses from funds where we own significantly less than 100%, usually between 5% and 10%. However, GAAP requires us to consolidate 100% of the funds results regardless of the size of our ownership. As a result, we have added disclosures in our press release that present non-interest income net of minority interests and gains on investment securities net of minority interests.", "With this in mind, let us take a look at non-interest income net of minority interest, which is a substantial part of our earnings base. For the year 2007, we grew non-interest income, net of minority interest, including carried interest, by $52.1 million or 40% due to strong gains from warrants and investment securities and from our four remaining core, fee-based products, which grew by $18.7 million or 22%. ", "For the fourth quarter, non-interest income, net of minority interest, decreased $3.3 million to $49 million compared to $52.3 million in Q3. The decrease was due primarily to two items, a decrease in corporate finance fees, and a decrease in gains on investment securities net of minority interests. ", "Additionally, we had some notable increases in our fee-based products. First let me address the decreases. Corporate finance fees decreased $2.5 million in Q4 due primarily to the winding down of SVB Alliant activities. We expect to close all remaining SVB Alliant transactions in the first quarter of 2008. We expect activities related to winding down SVB Alliant to have a neutral to slightly positive impact on our net income in Q1 2008. ", "Gains on investment securities, net of minority interests, including carried interest, decreased $0.6 million in Q4 to $2.2 million compared to $2.8 million in Q3. Despite this decrease, it is important to note that we recorded net gains in six out of eight funds in Q4.", "Now let us look at the positive results in non-interest income in Q4. Net gains on derivative instruments remained strong at $8.4 million in Q4 comparable to Q3 levels. Warrant gains were the largest component and were driven by strong M&A activity. Client investment fees increased by $900,000 to $14 million, and average client investment funds for the first time exceeded the $21 billion mark in the fourth quarter.", "For the entire year 2007, client investment fees totaled $51.8 million representing growth of $7.4 million or 16.8%. This business has almost doubled in three years. Foreign exchange fees increased by $1.3 million to $8 million, thanks to continued demand from clients across the board.", "Moving on to non-interest expense, non-interest expense increased slightly to $83.5 million in the fourth quarter from $83 million in the third quarter. As with non-interest income, an understanding of minority interest is important to assessing non-interest expense trends. Although we have funds in which we own significantly less than 100%, we are required to consolidate 100% of the expenses. ", "Let me reiterate that this is a non-GAAP measure. With that in mind in 2007 non-interest expense, net of minority interest, grew by $19.2 million to $335.8 million compared to $316.6 million in 2006. If you also exclude goodwill, the increase was $20.4 million or 6.8%.", "In the fourth quarter, non-interest expense, net of minority interest, increased $700,000 to $81 million compared to $80.3 million in Q3. The increase in Q4, in part, reflects the costs of building new revenue streams and the systems investment required to improve our efficiency. It is also a result of our strong unfunded credit commitments.", "There were three notable items in Q4. First, we recorded a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $1.6 million in Q4 compared to a reduction of $1 million in Q3. This represents an increase in expense of $2.6 million in Q4 and reflects growth of our unfunded credit commitments of $470 million. It does not have anything to do with credit-related issues.", "Second, we had decreases in compensation and benefits costs of $4.3 million in Q4, largely due to reductions of headcount at SVB Alliant and lower incentive compensation costs, owing to our better than expecting performance. ", "Third, professional services expenses, and business development and travel cost increased by $2.4 million as a result of our continued expansion and fund raising activities, both domestically and globally. Additionally, we increased our activities related to our performance-improvement initiatives. ", "As you know, it is a balancing act to grow a business while limiting expense growth. We expect this process to be somewhat lumpy from time to time and that is what we saw in the fourth quarter.", "Nevertheless, expense control and efficiency are top of mind as a result of our efforts in the past year. We are very pleased with our progress on the efficiency front so far and we will continue to focus on cost management as a means of increasing our operating leverage in 2008.", "Next up is credit quality. We continue to maintain excellent credit quality and our low levels of net charge-offs reflect this. Net charge-offs increased only slightly in Q4 and represented only 28 basis points of total gross loans annualized compared to 24 basis points in Q3. Fourth-quarter gross charge-offs of $4.7 million were just slightly higher than third quarter charge-offs at $4.1 million. This level of gross charge-offs is well within our comfort zone.", "Our total provision for loan losses of $6 million in Q4 reflects $3.1 million of provision primarily related to loan growth. In Q3, we recognize only $900,000 related to loan growth. As we said on our last conference call, we view non-performing loans as a meaningful indicator of credit quality. Non-performing loans at the end of the fourth quarter were $7.6 million compared to $9.9 million in the third quarter.", "Now I\u2019d like to move onto capital management, specifically share repurchases. We repurchased nearly one million shares of common stock during the fourth quarter, keeping up the high repurchase pace we set the third quarter. The aggregate cost of fourth quarter repurchases was $49.4 million. That brought us to a total of almost three million shares repurchased during 2007, at an aggregate cost of $147 million. ", "I would like to point out that this is the largest number of shares SVB has repurchased in one year since 2003 when we bought back shares in conjunction with the issuance of our contingently convertible debt.", "Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets currently stands at 10.1% and we are working to achieve our long-term target ratio of 8.5%. With respect to timing, we are targeting a ratio of 9% by the end of 2008. This of course is dependent on the state of the US and world economies. We will continue to work towards this goal taking into account the stability of the capital markets, the needs of the business, and the appropriate use of financial instruments at our disposal.", "Let us turn to our outlook for 2008. As in 2007, our 2008 outlook reflects our expectations for the full year 2008 versus the full year 2007. Although we will revisit and update our outlook as appropriate in our upcoming quarterly conference calls, it is an annual outlook. ", "For the year ending December 31, 2008, we expect that average loan balances will increase at a percentage rate in the low to mid-teens. Average deposit balances will grow at a low double-digit percentage rate with a majority of the growth coming from interest-bearing deposits. ", "Average off balance sheet client fund balances will grow at a percentage rate in the low-teens. Net interest margin will decline in 2008 based on expected decreases in Federal Reserve rates as well as recent decreases totaling 175 basis points. Our rate outlook is based on the Federal funds 30-day forward curve.", "Fees or deposit services, letters of credit, and foreign exchange and aggregate will grow at a percentage rate in the mid-teens. Client investment fees will grow at a percentage rate in the low-teens. The allowance for loan losses as a percentage of gross loans will remain at about the same percentage rate for 2007. Finally non-interest expense excluding expenses related to minority interest and goodwill impairment will increase at a mid-single-digit percentage rate. ", "Before moving to the question-and-answer session I would like to reiterate the following points. Our business remains strong. As we have said before and I believe it bears repeating, our business model and credit discipline have protected us thus far from any direct exposure to credit problems associated with subprime loans, or the housing industry. ", "We have a strong management team focused on growing our business. The absence in our portfolio of the kinds of credit issues that affect other banks has allowed us to continue serving our clients, developing new products, and delivering strong financial performance. We intend to continue that focus. ", "Our non-interest income revenue streams are robust. While interest rate cuts affect net interest income, they do not take away our ability to maintain strong non-interest revenue streams and create new ones. We continue to benefit from healthy non-interest income, which helps to lessen the impact of rate cuts on net income.", "Finally, I speak for the entire management team at SVB when I say that the efforts of SVB employees are wholly responsible for the outstanding year we have had in 2007. I want to thank them for their continued and successful efforts on behalf of SVB. ", "This concludes the review of our 2007 fourth-quarter and full-year results. With that, I would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "", "(Operator Instructions)  Your first question comes from the line of Joe Morford -RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford -RBC Capital Markets", "", "Loan growth has been pretty broad-based and strong in the low 20% range on average last couple quarters and the guidance is for kind of low to mid-teens. And I was just curious, what the kind of thought process is behind that? Is it just kind of growing off of a bigger base, taking into account the softening in the economy, just any color you could provide would be helpful?", "Dave Jones", "", "Joe, it is a recognition of the law of large numbers and it becomes increasingly difficult to maintain the level of production that we\u2019ve had of recent. It is also a certain amount of conservatism, uncertain about what the market demand for loans will be. ", "So our interest is great, but our interest may be suppressed by the market demand. And as has been the case in the past, we reserve the right to update our forecast on a quarterly basis going forward if we are presently surprised by the opportunity to increase our loans.", "Joe Morford -RBC Capital Markets", "", "You talk about the margin outlook based on your sensitivity and the rate moves. I guess if you could update us as of year-end what the sensitivity to balance sheet was to say a 100 basis point decline in rates and what that would do to net interest income on an annual basis?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "We will certainly be coming out with that in our 10-K. But as we have talked about the past, the general rule of thumb was approximately 50% of a move. So for example, a 25 basis point move by the Fed would affect our NIM let\u2019s say anywhere from say 10 to 12%. And clearly as we grow our loan portfolio or fund it with more variable type instruments then the sensitivity will be coming down. But I think as of now it\u2019s a safe rule of thumb for now.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "", "On the outlook, Ken, you mention during your prepared remarks that we ended the year 2007 on the verge of a recession. Do you think that the nation is poised to enter one in \u201908, and does your outlook incorporate that? And if not, what\u2019s the downside risk to your growth forecasts.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "I\u2019m basing my statement that we\u2019re on the verge of a recession on what I read in the newspapers and nothing more. It would appear that the US economy seems to be troubled. We don\u2019t think that\u2019s affecting our sector of the economy, at least not in any observable way so far. And we\u2019re anticipating growth in our sector both in the sector itself and in terms of our business activity levels in the sector.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "", "And I guess a follow-up question to that is how should we think about losses in \u201808? I don\u2019t know if I missed this during the prepared remarks but it doesn\u2019t appear as that you\u2019ve provided guidance surrounding charge-offs.", "", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "In the Q4 our net charge-offs didn\u2019t really move that significantly as well. And at this point we don\u2019t see any indication of that, at least for the next quarter, changing. So you are correct, we didn\u2019t put any specific number yet on that, just again we\u2019re waiting to see if we have any more transparency. But I would say we don\u2019t see any bogies in the system yet. ", "One thing you can look towards for example, is that we do have the guidance for the allowance for the loan-loss percentage which we say will remain at fairly consistent amounts with the prior year. So I think that\u2019s how I\u2019d open up with, and I\u2019ll pass it on to Dave to add a little more color.", "Dave Jones", "", "I really don\u2019t have much to offer I think that the indication that if we were to have larger losses we would have expected perhaps a change in the reserve and we\u2019re not forecasting that the percent of loan-loss reserves to funded debt will be materially different, if different at all for 2008.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Erika, there\u2019s one other thing I would add to give a more complete answer to the question that you originally posed and that is as we look out into the year and we think about what we think we can accomplish, in terms of rates, we base our expectations totally on the rate curves and so our expectations are directly in line with those of Wall Street in terms of the direction of interest rates. In that sense we defer to the real economists, I guess.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "", "And in terms of your growth outlook, is it safe to say that your relative optimism for your business vis-\u00e0-vis what we\u2019re seeing for your peers is because of the relative insulation that the venture investment community has; is that a fair conclusion to draw?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "I think that\u2019s a fair conclusion to draw. The venture portion, or the innovation portion, of the economy obviously doesn\u2019t operate in isolation and yet it\u2019s on a totally different timeframe. ", "I\u2019ve been doing this now for 25 years. And in each of the downturns in the economy that I\u2019ve observed, we have not seen the same kind of thing taking place in the innovation sector that we\u2019ve seen take place in the economy simply because investors are investing with a long-term horizon. And the level of investment, which is really what drives our business, is dependent on their long-term expectations, not their feelings about the economy as it stands in the moment. ", "I would invite both Greg and Mark to add that in that they\u2019ve been doing this for a long time, too.", "Greg Becker", "", "Just talking about the venture capital industry overall, I think Ken mentioned this in the opening remarks. You can look at how much money was raised last year, how much was invested, and how much was raised.  They raised more than they invested last year which I think bodes well for what our outlook is for further investment in 2008 and beyond. So that\u2019s one factor.", "The other factor when you look at the overall economy and some of the press about private equity in general private equity versus venture capital. It seems like private equity is more challenged than venture capital and there\u2019s so much more money in private equity.  That money has to go somewhere, and at least I believe that that also bodes well for fund-raising opportunities as we look into 2008.", "One final point as you talked about the overall economy and that there could be obviously more challenges in 2008.   We\u2019re set up for that in a way that other institutions aren\u2019t to be able to weather that. We have in our lending strategy, asset-based lending, and we also have factoring or receivable-based financing.  And that also allows us to weather a storm if it does occur over 2008 in a way that other institutions aren\u2019t.", "Mark Verissimo", "", "I would just add to that when we look at the investing over 2007, we didn\u2019t notice any difference between the first half of the year and the second half of the year. And clearly the subprime started to hit during the early summer months. In fact the fourth quarter ended up over $7 billion invested for the fourth consecutive quarter, which is the first time since 2001 that they\u2019ve done that. ", "So there are good investment opportunities. I think investors are seeing good innovation out there, and the structure of venture capital-limited partnership is very different than a hedge fund.  In a hedge fund you have the ability to get your money out much sooner.  Venture capital-limited partnership, you commit the money, and essentially your commitment is tied up for five to ten years.  So these are long-term investors and money that they\u2019ve put out for long-term.", "Operator", "", "Our next question comes from the line up Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Mike, I was hoping you could talk about capital management, give us an update, given how strong results are. You continue to generate capital quite strongly. Give us an update, and if you have plans that you can share with us regarding how aggressive you\u2019d be? Capital targets, ratio target and if you plan to issue hybrids?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "The target ratio which we\u2019ve commented in the past about the TCE to TA ratio which as you may recall was we said was at 8.5%. As a mentioned a few minutes ago I said that we like to get down to that level around 9% by the end of the year. ", "And again we\u2019re very cognizant of the economy as well. Even though our business is still robust and strong, we still do need to keep an eye over our shoulders to make sure we are still well capitalized, because we don\u2019t want to be in a position like some other financial institutions where for one reason or another you have to go to raise equity in the markets. So that\u2019s first point.", "Second point is clearly to get down to that TCE to TA ratio is going to involve share repurchases. And as far as the next upcoming quarter or two, we would probably be on par with about that same share repurchase pace as well. ", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "You meant same pace as 4Q.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Yes, during the next upcoming quarters or so next Q1 and Q2. ", "So then your third question with respect to the hybrid capital markets. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware of, we did mention last year that it was something we were interested in. And we have certainly kept our eye on the markets, but over the last couple of months the price to do anything in that market has just skyrocketed considerably. ", "So I think the sensible thing to do right now is wait for a little bit of normalcy to return to the credit markets. And so once we begin to see that, we will certainly reassess and keep everybody up to date on that matter. So those are the three main points.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Earlier you mentioned that in the VC segment there may be a potential risks that the segment stations this year. I was hoping to get a little bit more detail on that little bit more color. What you need to keep an eye on.", "Greg Becker", "", "I\u2019m optimistic as far as 2008 on the venture capital side and it\u2019s for two reasons. First of all, they raised more money in 2007 than they invested. And 2007 was a great year from an investment perspective so they have that dry powder to invest in \u201808 and 2009, which again bodes well for our business. ", "The second part is that when you look at the overall market where money exists, hedge funds have had more challenges. Private equity firms have had more challenges, and there is a lot of money still out there looking to find places to be put. And so if you\u2019re going to put money somewhere and you are looking for that sort of alternative asset investment, venture capital, at least I believe, is a good place for that money to go.  ", "So I think those two factors would I would say bode well for the market in venture capital for the coming years.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Nolan - Oppenheimer.", "Christopher Nolan - Oppenheimer", "", "Is the weak dollar affecting loan demands or possibly your activity in oversea markets? ", "Dave Jones", "", "Chris, I don\u2019t think that there is anything absolute that I can share that would confirm the point. But my sense of it is that the weak dollar is helping our business in that our technology clients are enjoying a healthy level of international transactions. ", "That may to some extent be supported by the fact that it\u2019s a little more economical for the foreign companies to be buying it now with the weak dollar. So I think that it is helping our business as opposed to any damage that it may be doing.", "Greg Becker", "", "Another benefit to the weak dollar I would say is actually the volatile currency market overall is the demand for FX and the demand for hedging, swaps, etc. So that actually has been beneficial to us, which is what Mike and Ken both described as higher fee income in 2007. And I don\u2019t know what your outlook is but I don\u2019t see that really slowing down a whole lot in 2008.", "Christopher Nolan - Oppenheimer", "", "And Ken are you seeing given the difficulty that some larger private equity firms are having given the credit markets, is that impacting any of the business you guys do in terms of doing bridge loans to PE funds while they are raising capital.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "No. The short answer is no. We haven\u2019t seen any change in the behavior of private equity firms in terms of the kinds of business that we do with them. Dave might want to add something to that.", "Dave Jones", "", "And the only thing that I would add to it is the nature of the business that we do with the private equity, so we\u2019re not in the business of funding a lot of the companies, non-technology companies that they may be investing in.  The principal part of our business is a capital call line of credit so that the private equity firms would have already raised their fund and we are just helping them manage their cash through our capital call lines of credit.", "Operator", "", "Our final question for today comes from the line of Fred Cannon - KBW.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "", "Can you really achieve a lot of your financial goals; your ROE\u2019s at 20%, your earnings growth are at 20%, shut down the SVB Alliant. Given the strength of the company and the capital are you anticipating any new strategic moves in terms of more rapid expansion overseas or anything else or is it pretty much just sticking to the knitting moving forward?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "I would say pretty much sticking to the knitting moving forward. We do have a long-term strategy which we\u2019ve articulated publicly on several occasions in the past year and we intend to continue making progress on that ratably over time. So you\u2019ll see us just continuing to forge on ahead with respect to all of our strategic initiatives. ", "I\u2019m happy to say that not only did we make the numbers that we committed to but we also made progress on each one of our strategic initiatives and exactly the kind of progress that we had anticipated and hoped for at the beginning of 2007. By the end of 2007 we\u2019d accomplished that and so we\u2019re aiming in the same direction again in 2008. And anticipate that by the end of 2008 we\u2019ll be even better positioned with respect to all of these very strategic initiatives.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "", "And finally, Mike, when you\u2019re talking about your capital goals for the year-end, how does that anticipate what happens to the contingent convertible security that I believe is comes due in June?", "Michael Descheneaux ", "That\u2019s good. I mean obviously that\u2019s from more of the debt side, so that certainly does come due in the middle of June. And we would certainly be considering about how we are going to refinance that so that\u2019s still to be determined but we\u2019re definitely looking at that actively.", "Fred Cannon - KBW", "", "But no updates on that?", "Michael Descheneaux ", "No updates at this time to tell you, not right now.", "Operator", "", "That was our final question. Are there any closing remarks?", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Thank you very much for dialing in and that concludes our call.", "Copyright policy: All transcripts on this site are the copyright of Seeking Alpha.

My name is Christie and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group's First Quarter 2008 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you. Today, Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO, and Michael Descheneaux, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss SVB's first quarter 2008 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of our management team will be able to take your questions.", "I'd like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including, without limitation, financial guidance for the first quarter and full year 2008. Forward-looking statements are just statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are just predictions and actual events or results may differ materially.

A presentation of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release.", "Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you, Meghan. I'm pleased to be here today to talk to you about another strong quarter, one in which we produced earnings per share of $0.81, ROE of 16.3% and net income of $27.9 million. We achieved strong loan and deposit growth, maintained our strong credit quality and met our expense control goals.", "These results, particularly in this current economic environment, demonstrate the strength of our unique business model. That is, we focus on a single industry; we meet the needs of our clients from early-stage through maturity; and because of our focus and in-depth knowledge of our clients, I believe we are adept at distinguishing between real risk and perceived risk. We've maintained that focus in good times and in bad, and it drives the delivery of our products, our services and our thought leadership, all of which improve our clients' chances for success and help to ensure continued growth.", "Although serving early-stage technology and life sciences companies remains the core of our business, and we continue to focus actively on those early-stage clients, much of our loan growth in recent quarters has been driven by our upstream initiative to expand our business with later stage, so-called corporate technology companies, and our continued focus on venture capital and private equity firms.", "On the deposit side, we continue to introduce new products to meet clients' needs and to attract deposits to the balance sheet. To this end, we introduced two new products in the last year targeted at emerging companies and those doing business overseas. Through these products, we added over $200 million to our balance sheet in the first quarter. On the funds management side, we've expanded our funds management team to expand our activities into emerging industries and global markets. We provide our clients not only with products, but also with information. Sometimes, this takes the form of thought leadership.", "In the first quarter, we issued a report that gave our early-stage and venture capital clients, the ability to benchmark valuations for private life sciences companies. This is the third time we've issued a report of this kind based on valuation data from thousands of companies, and we believe we're the only company with access to this kind of information.", "Our good advice pays off for our clients. Over three years ago, we advised our asset management clients to stay away from auction-rate securities, and we've continued to advise them to stay away from auction-rate securities since then as well. As many of you know, the market for those securities recently came to a near standstill and the advice we gave is helping us win new clients into our asset management business. Our bucking of the auction-rate securities trend was the subject of a very positive Wall Street Journal article last month. These activities helped to drive our success in the first quarter and we believe they are positioning us for future success. Despite our strength, as you are all aware, we faced a number of challenges in the external environment in the first quarter, which we expect to be there throughout the year. The first of these is interest rate cuts. We maintained a net interest margin significantly higher than industry average, despite continued reductions in the Fed funds rate. Nevertheless, each 100 basis point cut reduces our NIM by about 50 basis points. And now, that's consistent with our expectations and our public statements for the last several months.", "Turmoil in the global equity markets presented another challenge in the first quarter by suppressing company valuations and reducing the value of our funds management portfolio. The value of that portfolio includes unrealized gains and losses and varies according to market conditions. Accounting rules require us to record these changes in value on the income statement under gains on investment securities. These investment securities revenues, like those we receive from warrants, are highly variable and can be challenging to predict. We expect continued economic uncertainty in the year ahead to further increase the variability of these items. ", "We have built the impact of market cycles into our business model. In other words, we operate on the assumption that there will inevitably be bad times. This assumption, that we cannot depend on external market factors for our success, informs all aspects of our business planning. In April, it led us to further strengthen our liquidity position in order to support our growth by issuing 250 million in convertible notes. Mike, will talk about these in a few minutes, but I'd like to set the stage for that discussion by sharing our view that next to credit quality, sufficient capital and liquidity may prove to be the most critical success factor for banks across the country in the coming year.", "We feel that having the right people in the right leadership roles will also help to ensure our success. To that end, in the first quarter, we made a handful of management appointments that we believe will allow us to drive and support growth. We've promoted Greg Becker to President of the Commercial Bank. Greg will continue to oversee the bank's growth strategy, helping to ensure our continued market dominance among early-stage companies and growth in newer markets, such as later stage companies and private company valuations. To support this growth and that of our other business units, we named Dave Webb, who has been overseeing our performance improvement initiative, as Chief Operations Officer of SVB Financial Group. Dave will focus on creating an efficient and cost effective infrastructure to support our growth. In the first quarter, that mandate included moving forward on our plans to implement a new banking system backbone and identifying further opportunities for outsourcing certain operational functions.", "We remain positive on our outlook for growth in loans and in deposits. Our target markets are performing solidly and venture capital investing is alive and well. According to early reports on first quarter activity, and I don't think the final reports will be out for another few days, venture firms invested $7.1 billion in 922 companies during the first quarter. While this number is 8.5% lower than the high levels, we saw in the fourth quarter of 2007, it still represents the fifth highest investment quarter since 2001. On the front lines of SVB, this translates into a strong pipeline of prospective clients. As you are all aware, the technology IPO market has disappeared for the time being, which is likely to increase the variability of our warrants and securities gains and losses. Nevertheless, we expect to see continued good M&A activity in the coming year.", "We also see opportunities in the current economy, as currency volatility and the weak dollar have driven clients to increase their foreign exports, as well as their use of our foreign exchange services. While interest rate cuts will continue to drive our net interest margin downward, should they continue, we expect continued loan growth and our commitment to expense control to mitigate their EPS impact somewhat. We will maintain our underwriting discipline and focus on executing effectively in the present, while investing in future growth. Meanwhile, we are investing in our future through products, people and infrastructure. When the downturn in the global economy comes to an end, and it inevitably will, here at SVB, we will be well positioned to take advantage of it.", "Thank you. And now, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Descheneaux, who will discuss our first quarter results.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Ken, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today as we discuss our first quarter results. As Ken said, we delivered diluted earnings per share of $0.81 and net income of $27.9 million in the first quarter. Exceptional loan growth, solid deposit growth and contained expenses contributed to this strong performance, despite the impact of significant interest rate reductions and lower valuations on our investment fund portfolio.", "Before I proceed, I would like to note that in general, my comments refer to the first quarter of 2008 in comparison to the fourth quarter of 2007, unless otherwise specified. There are five areas I would like to highlight with respect to our first quarter 2008 results. First, we grew average loans in Q1 by an impressive $340 million or 9.2%. Second, we delivered solid deposit growth of 5.4%, increasing average deposits to $4.4 billion from $4.2 billion. Third, our net interest margin was 6.36%. The decline is consistent with our expectations and reflects the impact of continued, dramatic interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, partially offset by exceptional loan volume. However, our net interest margin still remains well above industry averages.", "Fourth, non-interest income was $41.6 million in Q1, which represents a decrease of $11.6 million. It was affected by lower company valuations and lower distributions in our investment securities portfolio related to our funds management business. In contrast, non-interest income from our core fee-based products, which includes client investment fees, foreign exchange fees, deposit service charges and letter of credit income, remained solid in the first quarter, with growth of 2.9%. Fifth, credit quality remained strong and in line with our expectations, with net charge-offs at 49 basis points of total gross loans annualized, compared to 28 basis points in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "I would like to discuss some details regarding our Q1 performance. Loan growth was strong in the first quarter, reflecting activity across all of our client industry segments. Average loans reached a record $4.1 billion compared to $3.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007. End-of-period loan balances also increased to $4.3 billion compared to $4.2 billion in the prior quarter. Our efforts to meet client needs by offering new products and services allowed us to make meaningful progress in growing our deposits in the first quarter. We raised average deposits by 5.4% to $4.4 billion and we increased period-end deposits by 3.4% to $4.8 billion. Increased deposits from global venture capital clients drove the majority of first quarter period-end increases and activity among our traditional technology clients drove average increases. Although average non-interest bearing deposits declined 1.4% from the prior quarter, demand deposit balances in the fourth quarter were exceptionally strong, and stronger than we had expected, and we did not expect to maintain those levels heading into the first quarter.", "As expected, net interest income decreased $5.2 million in the first quarter to $92.1 million owing to recent interest rate decreases. Our loan and deposit growth was able to offset a portion of the significant rate cuts in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the decline in net interest income and our net interest margin is consistent with our expectations.", "With respect to non-interest income, there are three separate points I would like to note. First, we had good growth in income from our core fee-based products in the first quarter. Second, we recorded a net loss on investment securities before minority interest of $6.1 million versus a net gain of $6.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. The driver of the loss in Q1 relates to $8 million of losses from our sponsored debt funds, primarily from one investment whose share price decreased significantly during a lockup period. We also noted lower valuations, as well as lower distributions, from our SVB capital funds. As Ken pointed out, the vast majority of these changes are decreases in unrealized gains, rather than actual cash losses.", "Third, we had a decrease in net gains from derivative instruments of $5.8 million, which was driven by a decrease in net gains on equity warrant assets of $2.8 million and a $2.9 million decrease in net gains on foreign exchange forward contracts, which are used to offset gains and losses from revaluation of our foreign currency denominated loans.", "Net gains on equity warrant assets decreased due to the decline in equity markets and interest rates which led to a softening of valuations in the first quarter. I would like to point out that gains on derivative instruments in the fourth quarter were extraordinarily high. Such variability in this line item is within the norm and we advise caution in trying to extrapolate trends from these figures.", "We actively continue to take new warrants and build the income potential of that portfolio. We obtained 117 new warrants in the first quarter compared to 105 in the fourth quarter, making this one of the highest quarters for new warrants in recent years. The decrease in net gains on foreign exchange, forward contracts largely results from a decline in the fair value of forward contracts used to mitigate foreign currency exposure risk on loans. As expected, the decline is offset by an unrealized gain resulting from revaluation of foreign currency denominated loans, which is recorded as other non-interest income.", "Let's move to client investment fees. Client investment fees decreased slightly to $13.7 million in the first quarter of 2008, from $14 million in the fourth quarter of 2007. Although average client investment funds were up in Q1, tighter margins resulting from lower interest rates caused fees from client investment funds to decrease. Average client investment funds increased 1.7% in the first quarter to $21.9 billion, while period-end total client investment funds declined $1.2 billion to $21 billion. This lower balance was due to lower proceeds from IPOs and in part, to our success at directing more deposits onto the balance sheet. Quarter-to-quarter, these balances are affected by DC funding levels and IPO activity, both of which were down in the first quarter.", "As I pointed out last quarter, an understanding of the impact to minority interest is relevant to understanding how much non-interest income falls to our bottom line. For details on this, please refer to the disclosures in our press release that present non-interest income, gains on investment securities and gains on derivative instruments, all net of minority interest and all non-GAAP measures.", "A large part of the decline in non-interest income in the first quarter was due to one investment held by one of our sponsored debt funds. If you net out minority interest, non-GAAP non-interest income was $43.3 million in the first quarter compared to non-GAAP net interest income of $49 million in the fourth quarter. This represents a decline of $5.7 million or 12%, which is about half of the decline indicated by the GAAP non-interest income figure.", "Now, let us turn to non-interest expense. As you can see from our first quarter numbers, we continued to manage expenses effectively. Non-interest expense was flat in the first quarter. It is important to note that we did have a net increase in compensation expense in Q1 due to an increase in headcount to support our growth, annual merit increases and other cyclical increases. We did benefit from a reduction in incentive compensation expenses in Q1.", "We recorded a reduction of provision for unfunded credit commitments of $0.2 million owing to a slight decrease in the balance of our total unfunded credit commitments. This represents a swing of $1.8 million from the fourth quarter of 2007 when we had a provision for unfunded credit commitments of $1.6 million. As with non-interest income, an understanding of minority interest is important to assessing non-interest expense trends. With this in mind, non-interest expense, net of minority interest, remained relatively flat in the first quarter of 2008 at $80.7 million versus $81 million in the fourth quarter of 2007.", "Moving forward, expense control and efficiency remains top of mind for us, as will managing our operating leverage. With that in mind, I want to comment on our efficiency ratio which rose to 59.5% in the first quarter of 2008 from 55.3%. This increase is primarily the result of the impact of Federal rate cuts on interest income and a decrease in income from investment securities gains and warrants. While our long-term objective is to move our efficiency ratio lower, we are comfortable with a sub 60% efficiency ratio, given the current economic environment.", "Let's move on to credit quality. We continue to preserve our good credit quality with net charge-offs in the first quarter of 49 basis points of total gross loans annualized, compared to 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. Gross charge-offs rose a modest $1.5 million to $6.2 million compared to $4.7 million in the fourth quarter, but remained within our comfort zone.", "Now, I'd like to move on to capital management and liquidity. We repurchased 980,000 shares of common stock in the first quarter of 2008, at an aggregate cost of $44.6 million, consistent with the pace of the previous two quarters. Additionally, we had a reduction of 248,000 shares from the dilutive impact of our contingently convertible debt as a result of a decrease in our average share price in the first quarter. I would like to point out that at the end of Q1, we had 1.2 million shares in our weighted average diluted share count related to our contingently convertible debt issued in 2003, which matures in June 2008. This represents 3.5% of our weighted average diluted share count at March 31st, 2008. If our share price remains below $51.34 prior to the bond's maturity, the dilutive effect of the contingently convertible debt will be removed when the bond matures in mid June. We expect that this will reduce our weighted average diluted share count in the second quarter. However, the bulk of the impact will not be seen until the third quarter of 2008.", "We reduced our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets to 9.8% in the first quarter, compared to 10.1% in Q4, largely due to share repurchases and strong loan growth. Although we are still committed to reducing that ratio further in the long-term to 8.5%, we are constantly assessing that goal in light of the U.S. and world economies, taking into account the state of the capital markets, the needs of our business and the appropriate use of financial instruments at our disposal. We have used our capital in recent years to support loan growth, to develop new revenue lines and expand our key capabilities in key markets outside the U.S.", "Our plans in 2008 and beyond call for continued investment in our business to support future growth. Given these priorities and the dislocation of the capital markets, we are strongly inclined to retain our capital. As a result, we are unlikely to repurchase any significant amount of shares in Q2. We will continue to evaluate this position as the year progresses. As noted in recent press releases this month, we issued 250 million of convertible senior notes due in 2011. The proceeds from this offering will be used to settle our existing 150 million due in June 2008, which has proven over time to be a low-cost source of funding for us.", "A portion of the proceeds from our debt issuance was used to purchase a call spread, which while not affecting the rights of note holders, is intended to effectively raise the economic conversion price of the notes for SVB from $53.04 to $64.43 per share. The remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes.", "Now, let us turn to our outlook for 2008. Our outlook reflects our expectations for the full year 2008 versus the full year 2007. Although, we will revisit and update our outlook each quarter, it is an annual outlook. We had three changes to our outlook for the year ending December 31, 2008. First, we are improving our outlook for average loans. Average loan balances will increase at a percentage rate in the low 20s. Our strong loan growth in the first quarter caused us to raise our original expectations for loans.", "Second, we have trimmed our outlook for growth in client investment fees to the high single-digit range due to lower VC investment in the first quarter and a lack of technology IPO activity, which we expect to persist into the second quarter. This also implies that balances would move in line with fees. However, we are increasing our outlook for certain fee-based income. We expect that fees for deposit services, letters of credit and foreign exchange, in aggregate, will grow at a percentage rate in the mid-20s. The rest of the outlook remains the same and I refer you to our press release for details on that.", "Before moving to the question-and-answer session, I would like to touch on a few additional points. Our business remains healthy, thanks to the resilience of the industries we serve and our credit discipline. Although the rest of 2008, promises to be challenging for all businesses, we feel we are well positioned to focus on effective execution and strengthening our business. While interest rate cuts affect our margin and our income, we will remain focused on offsetting their impact by introducing new products and services and continue to grow loans, deposits and fee income. We believe we have already felt the most significant impact of interest rate cuts and we look forward to the coming end of this cycle of interest rate cuts.", "We expect continued variability in our derivative and investment securities businesses. The turmoil in the equity markets will most likely suppress the value of our warrant and investment securities portfolios during 2008. While 2008 may be a challenging time for these investments, this is a long-term business, one which we expect to return along with a more positive market environment.", "We have a strong management team, the best employees and strong liquidity and ample opportunity to continue building momentum. Notwithstanding these difficult economic times, we continue to retain our focus and to make the best of this opportunity in order to build and retain shareholder value.", "This concludes the review of our first quarter 2008 results. With that, I would like to ask the Operator to open the call for questions.", "Questions-and-Answers Session", "Operator", "Certainly, sir. (Operator Instructions).", "Your first question comes from Joe Morford. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hello, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Maybe a question for Ken or Dave Jones, listening to your comments about the latest venture capital investment activity being down and then comments, Mike, about you're looking to preserve capital and maybe hold off on buybacks in the near term, given the turmoil in the capital markets and the downturn in the economy, any implications of all this for credit quality? And are you at all beginning to see any signs of stress in some of the businesses that you serve at clients?", "Ken Wilcox", "I think we'll give that one to Dave.", "Dave Jones", "Thank you and this is Dave. In terms of signs of stress, the answer to that one is no. The conversations that we have with venture capitalists indicate that they are comfortable with the marketplace and then are very willing to invest in their existing portfolio companies and continue to grow with new companies that they're funding. One of the things that we are seeing is that the time that is required to close the next round of venture capital is extending out a little bit. We've had conversations with the venture capital community and I'm comfortable in saying that that is not because the venture capitalists are disinclined to invest but rather it's just the adjustment to the valuation issue. So we've been in this period for two or three years of increasing valuations, and now, the management teams, and maybe to a lesser extent, the investors, are dealing with next round valuations that are not going up.", "And then it is taking a couple of extra weeks to close around while they get comfortable with the new valuation. But I think that given where we are in an economic cycle, that's completely to be expected, and I think that at least the near-term prospects for the marketplace is strong.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Okay. And then in the charge-offs this quarter, Dave, anything of note there, any trends or is it fairly granular?", "Dave Jones", "", "It is fairly granular. There were several in that $6 million number, so, very small pieces of business. It tends to still be the early-stage company that is creating most of our loan loss experience.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Okay. And then just lastly, any more color on just what drove just such strong loan growth in the quarter? It sounded like it was pretty broad-based, but even so this is the highest quarterly growth rate we've seen in years, really. And just anything in particular you can point to there?", "Dave Jones", "", "And this is Dave. At least I will begin the explanation. So I think there are two things to look at in that number. Joe, I think when you reference an above-average growth rate, I think you're probably looking at the average.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Yes.", "Dave Jones", "", "Quarter-to-quarter, as opposed to end-of-period, end-of-period. End-of-period from 12/31 to March 31 was about $200 million and we've obviously seen a volatile number but numbers between 1 and 300 million in recent quarters. So end-of-period didn't stand out quite as much as the average.", "The average was more a reflection of what occurred in the fourth quarter than what occurred in the first quarter. And as we were concluding [2008], a lot of our activities over the years with the later-stage companies came to fruition and several companies were closing on transactions with us. I'd like to say that that's because our message to the technology community is that you want to bank with Silicon Valley Bank because we are the market leader and we are the more reliable choice.", "I think that that probably was the case in some instances. In other instances, I can't say exactly why it was that we were so successful in the fourth quarter, but I'm very pleased with the areas of our growth, the quality of our growth and would be happy to extend on that if the market is similar.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Thanks, Joe.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from John Pancari. Your line is open.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Good afternoon.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Can you give us a bit of color on your expectations for the margin? And I just want to get an idea of what are in your assumptions right now in terms of Fed actions at the upcoming meetings. And then, in terms of your expectations for the margin, how much compression, can we see another leg down of this size next quarter? Or is this notably a larger chunk that we'll see? And that could be smaller going forward, of compression, that is.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Sure. This is Mike Descheneaux. So with respect to how we look at the interest rates going forward, we basically use the forward curve for our rate outlook. And what we have been saying publicly, probably for the last three quarters, is we generally use a rule of thumb of about for every 100 basis point change in the Fed's rate that drops to our NIM by about 50 basis points. And so when you look at this quarter, that held true once again, and we'll be coming out with more updated numbers in our 10-Q, but it looks that it's holding fairly consistent in that range, about 50 basis points that will affect our NIM for every 100 basis point moves in the Fed.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. And then what are your expectations for the Fed at the upcoming.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Well, you're just looking at the forward curve where most people are expecting a 25-basis point decrease this month.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Right.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "So that's how we follow it.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. All right. And then, can you give us a little bit more detail on your loan growth, linked quarter, I guess using the averages, by type? I know your classifications, you provided us with foreign terms of technology, private equity, life sciences, private client.", "Dave Jones", "", "And this is Dave Jones. Let me touch on that. So end-of-period, loan growth was roughly about 40% for private equity and 40% for the hardware, software and life sciences in aggregate. And then our other business lines would account for the difference.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Dave, maybe you should define those sectors though more specifically, so it's a little clear what you're referring to.", "Dave Jones", "", "In terms of the others?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Well, no, the first, the private equity refers to.", "Dave Jones", "", "All right. So in terms of the private equity, these would be the capital call lines of credit that we are making to the venture capital firms. So, not to be confused with the private equity that gets the Wall Street Journal attention.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Right.", "Dave Jones", "", "But capital calls is that we see.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. And then could you give us just an idea how has your loan mix changed in terms of the corporate tech versus Series A? I know you had provided it a little while ago. It was more like 80/20 corporate tech. How does that stand now?", "Dave Jones", "", "And that is continuing to weigh more heavily on the corporate tech side and it isn't because we are spending any less time with the early-stage; we're spending as much time as we ever have with the early-stage. But going back to my response to Joe, where we have loan losses in early-stage, it is that the early-stage is a relatively higher risk. And we manage that risk through the concept of granularity.", "So we need to make sure that the size of the business for the Series A, as you describe it, is relatively small. To find the quality opportunity for a $10 million piece of corporate tech, obviously, will significantly overshadow the good growth opportunities that we would have for the early-stage. So if it was 80/20, it's now moving in the direction of 85/15.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. One last question, on the corporate finance fees. I'm assuming, it seems like their closure or exit aligned actually ended towards the end of March. So as we see this corporate financings go away, should we expect a similar decline on the expense side?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "So, this is Mike Descheneaux, John. So this was basing, this is the last quarter of corporate finance fees and with respect to expenses, it's the same as well. So you won't see any of those going forward as well. But to be fair actually, we had a lot of the expenses were already cut out in Q3 and Q4 related to the normal operating infrastructure at aligned.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Andrea Jao. Your line is open.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Good afternoon, everyone.", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Hello.", "Meghan O'Leary", "", "Hi, Andrea.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Good afternoon.", "Dave Jones", "", "Good afternoon.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Hoping to get a bit more detail on the foreign currency denominated loans I was wondering why it was so noticeable this quarter and how much was the loan portfolio and how should we think about it going forward?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "So, Andrea, this is Mike Descheneaux. I'll take a start-out and if anybody else can jump on, please do so. But our foreign denominated loan portfolio is approximately around $40 million and it's largely denominated in, let's say, British pounds for the most part. And so clearly, with the dollar not being so strong, we basically had, sorry, let me rephrase that. Because the foreign currency that we have the loans in were strong we reported a gain, which goes into our other non-interest income. The flip side of that, which is what you're talking about is the foreign currency exchange forward contracts, which we use to try to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in currency movements.", "So you have to look at those two buckets tied together and then net-net, it's not overly significant numbers. But when you're looking on an individual basis, it can be kind of alarming or quite large fluctuations.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay. So, on a net basis, roughly a couple of million dollars benefit, right?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "I think it was a little bit over a million or so. It wasn't so significant.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Okay. And then on the securities losses, given that distributions are probably going to be lower than past quarters and valuations also to be lower than past quarters, if I take out the $8 million in loss, it looks like securities gains were about $2 million. Is that right? Is that a good run rate to think about that line item going forward?", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Well, I'm not going to comment about a run rate going forward, but I think your logic and how you're thinking about that, to take that interesting or one large item out of the picture, and then that kind of gives you a little bit better picture, at least for your side. So I think that is a fair way to look at it, but I won't comment on a run rate at this point.", "Andrea Jao - Lehman Brothers", "", "Fair enough. Thank you.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Thank you.", "Operator", "", "Your next question comes from Aaron Deer. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Hi. Many of my questions have been answered, but I'm curious with, given the strength that you are seeing and the relative strength of the markets in which you play, are you seeing increased competition at this point?", "Greg Becker", "", "Yes, Aaron, this is Greg Becker, I'll take that. I would describe it at stage of company. Early-stage is still, I would argue, pretty competitive and probably the simplest description around that is we compete in that area on the debt side with venture debt funds and other players like that. And they operate more like a venture fund where they have a longer-term investment horizon. So they're not as impacted by fluctuations of the existing market. So that market remains relatively competitive.", "Where we are seeing the competitiveness change is mid-to-late-stage companies and just one indication is that when we look at this limited number of small buyout deals that we're doing, six months ago, nine months ago, you would see a handful, maybe two handfuls of people competing for those deals, and today, you may see literally a couple.", "So clearly, the later the stage of the company, the fewer the companies that the competitors we're seeing in the market. And that is obviously creating demand.", "Aaron Deer - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then secondly, is there anything we can derive from the lower level of unfunded commitments at period-end?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave Jones. No, I don't think that there's necessarily anything. Maybe one factor to that is that at the end of December, we didn't see quite as much activity under the venture capital call lines as we did at the March 31 period. So those capital call commitments would have been in the unfunded commitments, whereas by the March 31 period, it would have moved differently.", "Aaron Deer - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, great. Thank you, everyone.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Fred Cannon. Your line is open.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Hi, thanks, and good afternoon.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hello, Fred.", "Dave Jones", "Hi, Fred.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Hi. I was wondering if you could provide a little color on the sponsored debt funds? You had the loss of $8 million on one investment and it looks like you only have three sponsored debt funds. I was wondering if you could kind of describe those debt funds and if these are kind of a core part of the overall fund business you have or kind of a peripheral type of activity.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Fred, this is Greg. We do have, as you point out, three sponsored debt funds and so I guess, first point is they are core to our business. One of the sponsored debt funds relates mainly to earlier stage companies and the other two relate to middle-stage companies. And the way you basically do valuations, it's probably the challenging part, when you have write-ups.", "In this case, a company went public. They were in a lockup period and the sponsored debt fund literally did everything that they could do to be a selling shareholder of the IPO. They were locked up. The stock price went down and we had already written up the valuation of the gain.", "So they did everything right from our standpoint and that's just a fact of the market. So the good news is it was a big gain and now it's a gain, but maybe not quite as big. So we still feel good about the strategy around them.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "So the net effect was basically a small gain and I guess the question is when was the initial gain booked? Was that in the fourth quarter?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So what happens, Fred, is it's marked on a mark-to-mark basis. So for example, if the fair value of the shares of 12/31 is X, there's the corresponding value. And then so what we're recording in this quarter is the change in the share price value from December 31 to March 31. And so that's what you're seeing. So essentially it's unrealized losses is what we have.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "I guess that question would be what's the cash flow on the debt funds? Is there from it, is there cash flow consequences here we should think about?", "Michael Descheneaux", "On that particular item? No.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Okay.", "Ken Wilcox", "Fred, this is Ken. I would also like to add to that. I don't know if this is what you were driving at with your question or not. But you were asking about the extent to which these debt funds were core to our funds business, I think was what you said specifically?", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Yes, exactly.", "Ken Wilcox", "And I would like to point out that they're really not core to the funds business. They're only nominally part of, or associated with the funds business. What they're core to would be the lending business. These are very strategic to the lending business because they extend our capabilities on the lending front, enabling us to offer a much broader spectrum of products and to our client base, and products at points in the risk-reward spectrum that would be much more difficult for a banking organization that was funding its loans through deposits to offer to its client base.", "So what it really does is it gives us a much broader and deeper product set and ultimately, brings higher returns to the shareholders than a bank could normally achieve with the kinds of loan products that a bank is able to offer.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Oh, okay. Thanks, Ken. So is it fair to think of these more then as part of the lending function, but kind of a mark-to-market part of a lending function?", "Ken Wilcox", "I think that would be fair. I think you need to think of it conceptually as being part of our lending business and I think we only nominally associate them with the funds business because of a structural perspective.", "They obviously fit under the rubric of the funds business. But from a strategic and operational and practical everyday perspective, they're very clearly a part of our lending business. And really and truly give us a much greater impact in our market than we would have otherwise if we were operating purely as a commercial bank.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette and Woods", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thanks, Fred.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Penala. Your line is open.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hello.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Hi, Erika.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "I just wanted to follow-up on one of the questions that was asked. You mentioned the competition has tempered for mid-to-later stage companies. Do you compete with mainstream banks in this sector? And if so, do you sense that real-estate-related troubles that have impacted the mainstream banks have pulled back their appetite to compete?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Erika, this is Greg Becker, again. So, the mid-and-later stage companies, we do see more traditional banks competing in that area, and I would say absolutely, we're seeing an impact by the turmoil in the credit markets related to real estate impact their willingness and ability to lend. Yes, absolutely, it's later stage.", "They're mainly focused on working with existing clients. We're not seeing a great interest in going out and adding new clients and clearly, lending money to those new clients.", "Ken Wilcox", "And Erika, I would just add to that the credit crunch that we all read about in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times, it clearly involves banks. It doesn't involve hedge funds and the very early-stage mark is, in some sense, driven, at least in part, by the activity of hedge funds which, and obviously, hedge funds come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.", "And some of them may not be doing as well as they'd like to, but others of them seem to have unlimited capital to deploy; whereas, the mid-stage and late-stage and corporate tech part of the market is served largely by commercial banks which are hampered now by some of the things that have happened in these past several months and are all part of what the Wall Street Journal thinks of as a credit crunch.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "And my second question is your lowered outlook for a client investment fund growth, is that due to a more pessimistic outlook for venture capital fundraising or is it because you're really trying to direct more of this money on balance sheet?", "Greg Becker", "Erika, this is Greg again. I'd say there's several things in there. The first thing is the outlook driven by IPO activity and I guess as we look at 2008, I don't see a big turnaround or a big improvement, at least in the near term, of IPO activity. And when our clients go public, the majority of those clients will keep that money in our off-balance sheet fund. So that's one of the drivers that\u2019s causing us to be a little more cautious on that guidance.", "The second point you mentioned was are we driving more of that on balance sheet and the answer is yes, and that is related to early-stage companies and other types of clients that clearly, we are focused on moving that onto our balance sheet.", "The third question relates to venture capital activity and I'd say your question was specifically about venture capital fundraising and although fundraising was down in first quarter, when we're out in the market, we clearly get the sense, in talking to investors that are looking to come into venture funds, that there's still a lot of money looking to come into venture capital firms. And so that is a good sign for the longer term outlook.", "Now, over the course of this year, the amount of money that's actually invested in companies, I think, as we experienced in the first quarter, may be a little softer than last year. And so that will have an impact if that impact plays out that way. So it's the combination of all those things that really causes us to be a little more cautious.", "Erika Penala - Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Brent Christ. Your line is open.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Good afternoon.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hi, Brent.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "It looked like you guys got a nice lift in the deposit service charges this quarter with rates coming down. I was just wondering to what extent we could kind of see that continue into the second quarter, just given the timing of the rate cuts and you lowering earnings credit rates?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, this is Greg again. And as Mike alluded to on the revised outlook guidance on some of the key drivers, we do believe that this core fee category of which deposit servicing fees is part of it, will continue to show nice growth for the year and that's obviously driven by the lower interest rate or lower earnings credit rate that clients get on those balances. So, yes, we do believe it will continue.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Got you. And the second question, with respect to the specific losses within the one investment in the sponsored debt funds. Can you give any specifics in terms of what security that one loss was tied to?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No, Brent. This is Mike Descheneaux. We actually don't provide that information. It's just, it was a publicly held company.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay. And then the last question is just in terms of the convert itself, can you talk a little bit about the rationale behind issuing the new convert and potentially what other options you considered, whether it was just calling the existing convert and why you decided to replace it with a new one?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Well, I think the first point you need to understand is there is a difference between capital and liquidity, as we all know and whilst we're very well capitalized and strongly capitalized at the bank holding company, you always do need the liquidity to pay off the debt, of course. Now, what the bank holding company does, it relies primarily on the bank to provide liquidity and when you start looking about all the growth opportunities we have at the bank and the strong loan growth, you always need to look for alternative liquidity channels for the bank holding company.", "So when we started thinking about that and we're looking at what's available in the financial markets that we could use to refinance, and you've seen all the dislocation in the credit markets. There's not a whole lot of available credit for the banks. The big banks still can tap the financial markets, but some of the smaller and medium-sized banks, it's a little bit different.", "So some of the alternatives we considered were certainly the just plain vanilla debt because most of the debt is not really readily available in the very short term. Of course, tenure debt is potentially available, but it's at extremely high coupon rate. So that was kind of the sweet spot for us is looking at it from an interest rate perspective and that convertible debt, offer that cost of funds at a low level.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Got you. And then the last question, just a follow-up with respect to the unfunded commitments coming down this quarter, could you give us a sense in terms of the sequential loan growth, how much of that was due to new business versus draw-downs on existing lines?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave Jones. And I really don't have that level of detail to be able to answer that question. We did have good client acquisition though, but I just can't parse up all of the loan funds to that level.", "Brent Christ - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Okay, no problem. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from James Abbott. Your line is open.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Hi, good evening.", "Ken Wilcox", "Yes.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "I have a question for you on a couple of things on the margin. Number one is, was there any prepayment penalty income in there? Last quarter, I think there was and maybe I missed it in the press release, but I was skimming really quick.", "Michael Descheneaux", "The answer, as you point out, we did have a large fee recognition last quarter related to some of these prepayments. It certainly was not as large this quarter. So that obviously hurt our margin a little bit, but our margin held up very strongly this quarter as well. Of course, every quarter, we have some prepayment fees that go in there. It's just a question of whether it's larger or smaller than the previous quarter, whether they're called down or not.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Yes, I'm sorry. But from just kind of looking at it qualitatively, would you say it's kind of back into a normal range here, Mike, or is it still elevated? Should we think about that coming down a little bit further?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No. I think I wouldn't say that it characterizes it at elevated levels. I would say we've got back more within normal, a more normal level.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay. And then also, do you have a sense or what the margin was in the month of March, just trying to kind of give us a sense for what the run rate might be? I understand there's some math that you've given guidance on based on what the Fed's done, but if you have the March margin, that might also help.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes, we don't give out, obviously, the March run rates, but again, as we said about the rule of thumb, the 50 basis points rule of thumb, we think that's pretty fair going forward. However, I will caveat that by saying we will come up with updated interest rate sensitivity numbers in our 10-Q. And so we're going to retest that and we back test that to make sure that's still consistent going forward. But it looks like that's going to hold true for a bit.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay. Well, I thought I'd try.", "Michael Descheneaux", "That's okay.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Now, we have seen, I just wanted to touch base on, this might be something for Dave, I guess, is I know that you've mentioned in the past that some of the losses tend to come from the early-stage. And then also what you tend to do is as things sort of deteriorate for these early-stage companies is you tend to move them into asset-based lending and also factoring. Can you give us some color around the migration trends there in the quarter or over the last six months? Just trying to see if you're seeing any movement there?", "Dave Jones", "And this is Dave. I will at least start the response and the answer is not a significant amount of movement from traditional products into the more monitored lines of credit, but I would caution that with regard to the economy as a whole, we're what, six, nine months into the decline? And for our client base in particular, we're not that far into the decline. So I think that our prospects for growth and to more structured and better compensated products is still ahead of us, not something that we would have expected to see by this point in the cycle.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And Dave, were the losses that came from this quarter still skewed towards the factoring? I know you mentioned it was early-stage companies, but specifically, was it coming out of the factoring that where the losses were?", "Dave Jones", "No, it wasn't. Actually, by early-stage, I would tend to characterize that as a company with no revenue or diminimus amounts of revenue versus a mid or a later-stage company with a healthy amount of revenue and a better prospect for factoring.", "James Abbott - Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay. So this quarter was still into the early-stage, low-revenue companies that was where the problem was.", "Dave Jones", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "There are no more questions in queue.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you very much.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thanks very much for listening to the call.", "Operator", "Thank you so much.

My name is Abigail [ph] and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group Fourth Quarter 2008 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions).", "Thank you, Ms. O\u2019Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Thank you. Today, Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO, and Mike Descheneaux, our Chief Financial Officer will discuss SVB\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end 2008 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of our management team will be available to take your questions.", "I\u2019d like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws including without limitation financial guidance for the full year 2009. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts.

This presentation may also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release.", "Now I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Good afternoon and thank you for joining us. As you can imagine all of us here at SVB have mixed feelings about this quarter for obvious and understandable reasons. All told it was a very mixed quarter. In many regards, I\u2019m very disappointed with our results. In many other regards I believe that we have a lot to be proud of and lot to be enthusiastic about.", "I would like to start with my disappointment. Our earnings for the quarter leave a lot to be decided. Our first three quarters this past year were all record quarters and we were horning in on a record year. And then in the final quarter, we effectively lost our chance before what would have been a record year. Instead of the $0.60 to $0.70 we are all expecting, we barely broke even.", "I should be clear from the press release we issued a week ago, the shortfall is almost 100% attributable to the provision. Instead of our usual 5 to $10 million, we took a $67 million provision in Q4. As a result we almost doubled our reserve, so I imagine you are all wondering why? The rise in the provision is partially due to approximately 24 million in net charge-offs in Q4.", "And it\u2019s partially due to $3 million to accommodate growth. But, primarily approximately $40 million is to build our reserve. So, what specifically happened? After what we have all been through in the past three months, I can imagine that the answer is fairly obvious.", "The deterioration in the overall economy both domestically and globally has finally caught up with us here at SVB. I know that I don\u2019t have to describe to you what has happened in the overall economy with that from a broader perspective and by that I mean from an overall perspective not necessarily ours we all entered into a new era in these past couple of months.", "Beginning in October, markets flows as fear began to dominate emotions and the control behavior, by virtually every single measure of economic health and progress both the U.S. economy and most of the global economy continue to deteriorate and that deterioration after October was deeper, more dramatic and more pervasive than almost anybody had expected.", "And as a result, this time even the world of venture back technology and life sciences companies has been affected as well. Just in these past couple of months a lot has happened almost all of it negative, on a average we believe the sales at our portfolio companies have dropped off somewhere between 5 and 15%. And in a few cases potentially even more.", "Venture funding has dropped off significantly in these past couple of months both in terms of the amount of money that traditional LP's have been willing to commit a new funds and in terms of the amount of money that DCs have been willing to invest in new companies.", "After rising every year since 2003, venture capital investment fell from 31 billion in 2007 to about 28 billion in 2008. During the same period fund raising dropped over 21% from above 35 billion in 2007 to 28 billion in 2008. Exits are few and far between. There are no IPOs and relatively few trade sales. And even those few trade sales are at valuations that are significantly lower that has been true for a number of years. LPs are struggling largely due to the so-called denominator effect. Because the values of the other parts of their portfolios have dropped dramatically, they are in effect overcommitted in so-called alternative assets, which include venture capital.", "I would like to emphasize however that this has not at least not yet resulted in them not responding to capital calls. To the best of our knowledge and our knowledge is extensive, LPs have continued to respond to capital calls. But on the other hand because of the denominator effect they are reluctant to commit money to new funds and may be for sometime. Fortunately, there is enough dry powder in the system and by that I\u2019m referring to money that limited partners have already committed and if not yet delivered. Enough money in the system to last for some considerable amount of time. The result for the world we live in has been as follows.", "Across the board, venture capitalists are forcing their companies to tighten their belts and across the board, the CEOs and CFOs of our portfolio companies are worried about two things. Will their own customers continue to buy product and if they do will they themselves be able to find funding to support those sales, and the impact on us is in part I\u2019m sure obvious. We are seeing some of our portfolio companies struggling to a greater extent and it has been true for years.", "As we experienced in the fourth quarter things can change very dramatically and very fast. Our warehouse facility with HRJ Capital in the case in point. HRJ is a company that we worked with for ten full years with a proven track record, a talented team and access to some of the best venture capital funds in the world. We had never seen them struggle to raise money from limited partners. But that changed in 2008 and HRJ and by extension SVB, found ourselves in the unfortunate situation we have since discussed.", "We have learned from this and we are refining our processes to help us avoid such instances in the future. Not only are we monitoring our larger credit more closely than we have in the past. But we are also modeling out for a broader set of future economic scenarios to better understand what extreme changes in the economy such as we saw in these past couple of months would mean to each individual credit.", "While on the other hand, we are seeing some of our portfolio companies struggling on the other hand and I\u2019m sure that this is not so obvious. We believe that our portfolio companies are still doing surprisingly well particularly in light of what is happening in the rest of the economy. In many cases, the products that they are developing or selling are actually even more necessary to their clients in a recession than they would be during a boom.", "I would like to underscore even in a recession there is likely no better part of the economy to invest in than the world of venture backed technology and life sciences companies", "I would also like to underscore that in 26 years of lending exclusively to this industry I have never seen it so affected by developments in the larger economy as we are seeing today.", "So, let me now turn to the good news to the part of the quarter that I believe we deserve to be proud off and that continues to feed our enthusiasm. Our capital base is strong, and I would argue stronger than it has been for some time. Our liquidity has improved significantly. Our success in attracting deposits out of our broker dealer and onto our balance sheet has driven our loan to deposit ratio from 97% down to 74%.", "And I would like to underscore, well loans have continued to grow in our fundamentals continues to be strong deposits of grown 62% in the last year. Loans have grown 33% in the past year and will continue to grow albeit at a smaller or slower phase in 2009. Commercial banking fee income has grown 15% in the past year, and would have grown more had it not been for the drop in rates. And our NIM while reflecting the continued drop in the said funds rate has held up I believe surprisingly well and the year when the FED funds rate drop 400 basis points, our NIM lost only a 151 basis points.", "And we have continued to control our expenses even while investing in our future. Year-over-year non-interest expense dropped 9% inclusive of the fourth quarter Incentive Compensation and Employee Stock Ownership Plan reduction of 24 million.", "Finally a few words on the outlook. Well I can\u2019t tell you how long or how deep this recession will be, we will continue to focus on the long-term benefits or you the shareholder and for our other constituencies as well. And of course we continue to focus on the fundamentals growth and loans, growth and deposits, credit quality, growth in fee income, NIM, expense control and the strength of our balance sheet and we believe as importantly we continue to focus on the future in preparing ourselves to take maximum advantage of it on your behalf.", "We believe that the economy will eventually turnaround and that our sector will turnaround with it. America has not given up on innovation nor will it in the future. Every year we see growth in the number of fundable ideas. Capital is still at least in theory available in abundance and the world continues to clamor for the kinds of products and services that the companies we work with produce.", "And that\u2019s where we see opportunity in this chaos, if we continue to support our clients and invest in our future I\u2019m confident that we will emerge from this recession far stronger than our competition until then we are ready for whatever may come our way. In these economic times being ready begins with capital and liquidity. Throughout 2008 we worked hard to ensure that we had adequate levels both in terms of safety and soundness and to ensure we could fund our growth.", "With that we\u2019ve made refinements to products both in terms of loans and deposits some that produce greater flexibility for our clients. We are better prepared today to help them meet their financial needs no matter their size or location and most importantly as a result of these investments when this recession does come to an end we will better - see better positioned we think than our competition.", "No matter how disappointed any of us are employees or investors, let\u2019s not lose sight of an essential fact. this company earned $80 million this year. A year when most banks struggled to make a profit that\u2019s something we can feel good about.", "Finally, we are ready for that ever may come because we have over 1,200 dedicated employees to all of the SVB\u2019s listening in on this call will perform so well and this very difficult year I want to recognize you and thank you for your valiant efforts in the phase of an increasingly challenging economy.", "And now I would like to turn things over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Thank you, Ken and thank you everyone for joining us today. I want to start by addressing the obvious challenges we had during the quarter and some of their effects and then I will talk about some of their high points.", "In the fourth quarter of 2008, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.09 and net income available to common shareholders of 2.9 million compared to $0.80 and 27 million in the third quarter. For the full year 2008, EPS was $2.33 and net income available to common shareholders with 79.1 million.", "Return on equity for 2008 was 11.2%, which is a respectable number for any year but, particularly for 2008.", "One of the driving factors behind our fourth quarter numbers was an increase in our loan loss provision. Fourth quarter results were also affected by lower client investment fees, a result of the historically low rate environment. We had another solid quarter of loan growth, thanks to our hardware and software industry clients, although they are exciting headwinds to future growth. We delivered outstanding deposit growth, and we\u2019re pleased to announce that our total assets reached a milestone of $10 billion in the fourth quarter. Finally, we refortified our already strong capital position to our participation in the Treasury\u2019s Capital Purchase Program.", "Now let me move into some specifics. Credit quality. Clearly credit quality had the largest impact on Q4 earnings, so I\u2019d like to start with that. Our provision increased from 13.7 million to 67.3 million from Q3 to Q4, which reflects the impact of increasing our allowance for loan losses from 1.13% to 1.87% of total gross loans. This increase was primarily due to the impact of the deteriorating economic environment and its current estimated impact on loans as well as reserves related to HRJ.", "Our net charge-offs increased from 47 basis points in the third quarter to 171 basis points in the fourth quarter. Non-performing loans also rose to 1.57% of total gross loans or 87 million versus 18 basis points in the third quarter or 9 million, due again primarily to HRJ and a Private Client Services loan.", "I want to make a few points before I move on. First, we do not believe these elevated charge-offs are indicative of overall weakness in our underwriting. As you know larger loans of 10 to 20 million and above have been a key part of our growth in recent years and we have a history of strong underwriting and monitoring. Moreover, we have just concluded an additional review of all loans in our portfolio larger than 20 million and concluded that our underwriting standards are effective and appropriate for this type of lending.", "We are disappointed with increase in provision. As we have said in the past if the economy continues its downturn, we would expect to see more of an impact on our loan portfolio in coming quarters. Given current economic conditions, we are increasing our vigilance and will continue to monitor our portfolio closely and to address matters in a timely manner.", "This recession of the economic environment in relation to our portfolio along with horizon charge-offs cause it to significantly increase our level of allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total growth loans in the fourth quarter from 1.13% to 1.87% inclusive of specific reserves for impaired loans.", "Excluding specific reserves for impaired loans, our allowance as a percentage of gross loans was 1.41% for Q4\u201908 versus 1.03% for Q3\u201908.", "Loans. Moving on to loans, we finished the year the way we started it, with strong growth in the fourth quarter. Average loans grew 7.5% to 5.2 billion in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of loans to our hardware and software clients. This growth was partially offset by decreases in loans to venture capital funds for capital calls. It\u2019s worth noting that we continue to take in a considerable number of new warrants for early stage of lending especially given a tightness of the credit markets right now. In 2008, we took 556 new warrants compared to 374 in 2007.", "Now let me move onto deposit, where our focus on a strong balance sheet continues to pay off. We grew average deposits in the fourth quarter by 18%, or 853 million to 5.7 billion. End of period deposits grew by an astounding 2 billion, or 38% to 7.5 billion. This increase was driven primarily by our decision to fully utilize our own balance sheet Sweep product, which we introduce in 2007 and to transition away from third party off-balance sheet product.", "We also expect to see some additional increases on the balance sheet in January, as a result of that strategy. Our results demonstrates the success [Audio Dip] to growing deposits and funding loan growth by adjusting our strategy for on and off-balance sheets fund that meet our clients risk profile and needs. In 2008, average deposits grew 24% to 4.9 billion and period-end deposits at 7.5 billion to 62%. This is a dramatic turn around from two years ago when average deposits were down almost 6% year-over-year.", "Now I would like to move on to net interest income and the margins. Our net interest margin held up relatively well at 5.42% in the fourth quarter compared to 5.73% in the third quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by certain reductions in our prime-lending rate in response to fed rates cut in the fourth quarter. It is important to note that as a part of our broader focus on pricing, we decreased our prime rates by only 100 basis points in the fourth quarter while the fed decrease rate by 175 basis points.", "The tight credit markets and increased risks are allowing us to proactively increase our pricing. Lower interest rates on our short-term investment portfolio also contributed the decline in them, and we are offset somewhat by lower interest expense from reduced short-term borrowings.", "Net interest income increased slightly by 1.9% to 96.9 million in the fourth quarter, going to a decrease in interest expense from short term borrowings, and strong average loan growth. Net interest income for 2008 was down only 2% to 372 million primarily as a result of fed rate cut during 2008 even though fed rate were down 123% or 400 basis points.", "Moving on to capital management, due to our outstanding asset growth in the fourth quarter, our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets decreased to 7.5% from 9.2% albeit still remains at a strong level.", "In December, we received 235 million in capital through the Treasury\u2019s Capital Purchase Program. As we disclosed earlier, we intend to use these funds for continued growth particularly lending to the markets we serve. Moreover the additional capital will allow us to absorb potential credit or investment losses should they occur without interrupting our lending activities.", "We've been asked why we had applied these funds given our strong capital levels. And the answer is that we felt the uncertainly of the current economic environment, and our growth plan called for maximum flexibility.", "Moving onto non-interest income, non-interest income was sharply low in the fourth quarter at 28.9 million compared to 41.7 million in the third quarter, primarily due to net losses on investment securities from venture related investments of 9.8 million.", "The bulk of these losses were related to lower valuations of investments within our managed funds. As you may recall, we only own a small percentage of these funds so that net of minority interest is only about 1.1 million of the loss actually fell to our bottom-line.", "As I mentioned earlier, client investment fee income in the fourth quarter was lower at 9.5 million compared to 13.6 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower margins earned on certain off-balance sheet products owing to historically low rate in the short-term fixed income markets.", "Average client investment balances, also known as off balance sheet funds increased by 1 billion to 21 billion, primarily due to our decision to fully utilize the on-balance sheet sweep products we introduced for clients in 2007, and transition away from the third party off-balance sheet sweep product we had previously offered clients.", "End of period balances were 18.6 billion compared to 21.5 billion at September 30, 2008. Although we had great success in growing our off-balance sheet products in recent years, the extremely weak IPO market in 2008 has hampered those efforts. However, we have succeed in our efforts to provide clients with a range of on-balance sheet products that meet their needs and that has resulted in our tracking on to our balance sheet, some funds that would have previously gone off-balance sheet.", "I would like to turn to non-interest expense now. Through the third quarter of 2008, we exceeded our targets for controlling expense growth. But while on the fourth quarter, non-interest expense was substantially lower at 62.9 million compared to 80.4 million in the third quarter, that drop was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense as a result of below budget results for the quarter and for the year.", "Now I would like to review our outlook for 2009. We are taking a slightly different approach this time in light current economic conditions, and are aiming to provide more insight on additional items. Having said that I\u2019m sure you can all appreciate that it is difficult to forecast what will happen in the coming year given the uncertain and rapidly changing economic environment. We expect 2009 to be challenging in terms of suppressed evaluations for our client companies, a lack of exit opportunities, continued pressure on our net interest margin and the high probability that we will see rising credit costs.", "Our outlook reflects our expectations for the full year 2009 versus the full year 2008. Although we will revisit and update our outlook each quarter, it is an annual outlook. Please refer to our press release for additional information. For 2009, we expect average loan growth at a percentage rate in the mid teens, with a significant amount of this increase relating to the full year effect of our 2008 loan growth on average balances.", "We expect average deposit growth and a percentage rate in the high 30s again primarily related to the full year effect of 2008 deposit growth. Most of this growth will be in interest-bearing deposits. We expect net interest margin to range from 4.7 to 5%, assuming no changes in our own prime rate and market expectations for LIBOR and short-term treasury yields. We expect credit quality to be under continued pressure in 2009 as a result of their continued economic downturn, with our allowance for loan losses at approximately 1.4% of total gross loans exclusive specific reserves for impaired loans.", "We expect net charge-offs to be approximately 1.3% of gross loans. We expect gross at a percentage rate in the mid single digit and fees for deposit services, letters of credit and foreign exchange in aggregate as a result of continued negative economic pressures. We expect client investment fees to decrease by roughly half compared to 2008 levels as a result of lower expected client investment fund balances and lower margins on certain products tied to the short-term fixed income markets.", "Although deviating from our norm a little bit, we want to talk about our expectations for some of the more variable items that contribute to non-interest income specifically warrants and SVB capital venture related investments.", "As I pointed out earlier, these items are challenging to predict in the best of times, but I would like to talk to you about our expectations at this point. We expect net gains on warrants to declines modestly compared to 2008, owing to a lack of IPOs and continued pressure on M&A and venture capital investments.", "Owing to these same market forces, we expect net losses on investments in our venture capital related activities to SVB capital, net of minority interests to increase modestly.", "Finally, we expect non-GAAP non-interest expense growth at a percentage rate in the low 20\u2019s. And let me reiterate that while this expense growth number may seem high, our success in controlling expenses in 2008, and the exceptionally low compensation expense in the fourth quarter suppressed non-interest expense during 2008 to levels that are not sustainable, particularly, if we are to continue investing and building our business. If the 2008 non-GAAP, non-interest expense was normalized for the unusually low incentive compensation expense in Q4 2008, then our non-GAAP, non-interest expense growth for 2009 compared to the full year 2008 would be approximately or would be expected to be approximately 10%.", "Before we move to Q&A, I would like to summarize briefly. Despite a truly terribly year for banks and the global economy, in 2008 we delivered a solid return on equity as well as outstanding loan and deposit growth, which are both the twin engines of our business. We have proven that we are able to execute on our strategy.", "While the fourth quarter demonstrated that we are not immune to the problems plaguing the broader economy, we remain confident in our underwriting approach to our loan portfolio and we\u2019ll maintain a high level of vigilance in underwriting and monitoring our loans.", "We are making the decisions we think are necessary to continue to operate successfully and effectively in this environment. And we are focused on ensuring continued prudent credit monitoring as well as maintaining a strong balance sheet. While we work to navigate the current market environment successfully, we are also laying the groundwork for growth and efficiency beyond this market cycle. As always our employees are the key to our success not only weathering to the current storm, but in preparing for better days ahead.", "This concludes the review of our 2008 fourth quarter and annual results. With that I would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hello Aaron.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill", "I guess in my question, I would like to ask about the \u2013 the cashes on the balance sheet haven't brought in all these deposits on balance sheet, you\u2019ve got a tremendous amount of cash there. And I guess it is the deployment of that cash, it\u2019s going to help to drive some of this margin compression that that you expect to see. Can you talk a little bit about how you intend to invest that and how quickly and maybe specifically what kind of - I imagine some of it\u2019s just going to be deployed into securities always near-term here and what kind of securities might be put in that and what kind of yield your are seeking?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, Aaron this is Mike Descheneaux here. In general, we will be continuing filing our investment policy, which is traditionally into fixed income securities. And I think you raised an important point about a distinction between here in the short-term as well more in the long-term. Our biggest priority here right now is maintaining security of those funds as well as liquidity. I mean those are two extremely important variables. So, right now, certainly we are very heavily focussed more on the short-term overnight investments. And as we\u2019ve began to understand more clearly the behavior deposits, in other words will they end up sticking on our balance sheet, or how sticky will they be, that will begin to dictate more or less where we start to invest the monies in longer term securities, again following the premise for a safety and liquidity. As far as yields right now again I am not prepared to comment on this at this moment.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. It sounds as though you are comfortable just letting the certain cash or cash lite products here for the time being?", "Mike Descheneaux", "You know until we see a little more clarity on that deposit behavior I think that is extremely the most sensible thing is environment. The last thing that we want to do is all of them get looked into a longer-term decision that we don\u2019t have the clear vision on what\u2019s going to happen with that deposit behavior. Again one other things to also remember why we were also after this - driving these assets on balance sheets, again is more focusing on our loan to deposit ratio to make sure we have the appropriate funds to be able to lend for the future.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Right, Okay. Thank you I\u2019ll step back.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Good afternoon.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hi, John.", "Dave Jones", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Can you give us some color on what drove the rest of the increase in non-performers in the quarter, I know we had obviously the portion of HRJ move on there. So, if you could just give us some detail what drove the rest of that increase?", "Dave Jones", "John, this is Dave Jones. And what we experienced was the HRJ as you mentioned and Mike referenced in his presentation one of our private clients services relationships moving into non-performing. And then after that there were a number of much smaller relationships consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in past quarters.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, then no discernible trend on what\u2019s moving into non-performer at this point, whether it\u2019s any deterioration in your early stage DC backed, tech lendings or anything?", "", "Dave Jones", "And this is Dave. We are seeing a deterioration in the early stage, business to be expected and when that \u2013 here is a key part of our business in hand and in a environment like we have today, we will see some object in non-performings in that category and that uptick in our perspective of that segment of the portfolio for the foreseeable future is a part of the decision behind the reserve increase.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "Okay, now if you are just talking about how there may have been a change in and your expectations from last quarter for that specific portfolio I know you had described in the past that, it was that VC back to tech companies and comprised about 30% of your loans back in a \u2013 do in a .com bus and another about 10%. Losses on that portfolio peek that around 6% last during the downturn and so we extrapolate that out to the 10% contribution now and you could find an normalize loss ratio of around 60 basis points to set us so. Can you tell me how that compares what you are starting to see now?", "Dave Jones", "And again, this is Dave. We are not seeing loan losses at that level as yet, and what we are sensitive to is that we may experience over the balance of 2009 loan losses from the early stage portfolio rising to big somewhat comparable with what we saw and the 2000, 2001, 2002 timeframe.", "John Pancari - JPMorgan", "Okay, all right. All right I will step back. Thank you.", "Dave Jones", "Thanks John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Penala with Banc of America. Your line is open.", "Erika Penala \u2013 Banc of America", "Good afternoon.", "Dave Jones", "Hello Erika.", "Erika Penala \u2013 Banc of America", "Hey, just I have a follow-up question, I guess on the back of what John I think was trying to ask, but either 130 basis points of the loss of guidance that was given for '09. Could you give with the sense in terms of what your expectation are for losses and dividing into your early stage portfolio your mid stage that portfolio and then your VC capital call line portfolio?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave and what we have to done as we have gone through exhaustedly in our portfolio and we have looked at our criticize book of business, we have looked at our early stage lending and, but we are anticipating trends within the venture capital investment activity that will make some of our early stage companies vulnerable. We have also evaluated the merger and acquisition activity, and that operates as a secondary source of repayment for the early stage companies. And we have seen a greatly diminished appetite for companies to offer and then to close on the M&A activity. We have concluded therefore that that best part of the portfolio is going to experience a difficult 2009 and a significant part of the loan loss forecast that we have is in that portfolio. And we cannot ignore the 90% of the business that is not in that portfolio and we recognize that given the economic climate that we are going to have some loss possibility, loss experiencing and that other 90% of the portfolio and if balance is out the loan loss broadcast.", "Erika Penala \u2013 Banc of America", "And how are you thinking about the portfolio that comprises the VC capital call lines, because in traditionally you have had really no losses and it\u2019s, very shorten duration and so in terms of, when you look to formulate this guidance what were you thinking in there?", "Dave Jones", "Right, so there is an important distinction to be drawn between what we have historically done with our capital call lines of credit and they charge a relationship. And I am \u2013 I will remain very confident there the billion dollars of lending activity that we would do with the capital call lines of credit is still going to be a very high quality portfolio. Not expecting, they were going to have material changes to suggest we may not have any change in our loss experience for capital call facilities. Again the distinction there is HRJ was not a confirming capital call facility.", "Erika Penala \u2013 Banc of America", "And I guess with HRJ, could you just \u2013 you just remind us what is \u2013 what the remaining exposure is and if you could, is there - is any update in terms of the potential agreement that you are trying to forge with managing one other funds.", "Dave Jones", "And this is Dave. What we \u2013 what we shared with \u2013 with closing a relation in the mid December timeframe and was that we had $68.6 million of exposure, what we are updating as that we have experienced $10 million of collections against that facility and we also indicated that we have had a loss experienced in the fourth quarter for part of the relationship. So, I don\u2019t wanted to be too detailed with an individual client experience, but I think you can see that right there. There is a pretty significant decline.", "Erika Penala \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. Thank you.", "Dave Jones", "", "Thanks Erika.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks, good afternoon everyone.", "Dave Jones", "", "Hi, Joe.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess also on the charge-off side Dave maybe you could talk a little bit more about the \u2013 it sound like maybe large software credit that was charged off and any other notable items in the fourth quarter there?", "Dave Jones", "Yes thanks Joe and relative to the almost $24 million of net charge-off referenced. I would just mention that that there was part of it that related to the HRJ relationship from, and Mike indicated that there was part slightly larger than HRJ in the one software company. And that experienced related to a piece of trimmed at that was underwritten to cash flow with that one borrower. And after those two loss experiences then we had loan losses that would reflect much of what Joe you would have seen in \u2013 in the third quarter, second quarter, first quarter before that.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Turn after that I guess the other question I had was for Mike because you talked about the expense side of things and even normalizing for the ICP and stuff this maybe like a \u2013 the outlook is for like a 10% growth but it still strikes me it\u2019s a little high given the - in the current environment and with revenues under pressure and I was just want a little bit more color on that if I could and also what can major growth and investments here your planning on making it drive that?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Yeah Joe, this is Ken, let me start-off and then we will turn it over to Mike because you exclusively requested Mike. I\u2019m or maybe a little bit more a numerical analysis but there are a couple of things that I think we need to consider here. One is that our volumes have grown considerably in this last year. I think you noticed the 60 plus percent increase in deposits and that are on the balance sheet and you noticed the 30% plus increase in loans and you also probably noticed in Mike\u2019s guidance for 2009, that we are anticipating that there will be further increases in activity. There has been an increase. There have been increases in absolute number of clients. There have been increases in market share. There are increases in our fee-based income - it some, it\u2019s a little bit difficult and you and I discussed this 10 years ago the last time the federal rates down to historical lows, it\u2019s a little bit difficult to reduce expenses significantly given that most expenses are headcount just because rates have dropped and while volumes are increasing because the number of people that you need to do this job is a function of how many clients you have and how things are buying. It\u2019s not really a function of where the fed funds rate has gone. The other thing I would say is that in an era of extreme economic deterioration such as we\u2019re all experiencing right now and with anticipated increased credit costs reducing expenses, which is tantamount to reducing headcount is probably not something that would benefit the shareholders over the long haul. And of the third thing that I would say is that in many, many regards I think that we are gaining steam have for the last year and continued to in 2009 and I don\u2019t think that it would be good for the shareholders at least the long-term shareholders to do anything that would reduce the potential for capitalizing on our increasing market share in the future.", "Mike Descheneaux", "And may I add a few comments Joe since you did call my name? Well, let me just assure you that we are extremely focused on expense and we have not loss side is the importance of that and the power of that that can bring to the bottom line. Just to recall a little bit of the things in 2008 is we had invested considerably in our people in 2008 particularly a new heads, a new FT, new employees that we added. In relation to loan portfolio management, so we saw - sometime ago that we know we needed to put more people on monitoring our loans, which we did. We are also building out our global practice you may recall that we got our license in India to lend in our non-banking financial corporations. We also opened up an office in Israel. Again all things that are certainly going to contribute in the long-term to our growth and finally as well we've been investing in our infrastructure systems, which in the long-term will help us be more efficient. So, those are certainly some of the areas that we have added and maybe one last thing is even in our analytics business, if you look at the traction that that\u2019s starting to get in the revenue growth so those are some of the areas that we've been spending our money on.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, so it sounds like you just with these costs building through the year, you got kind of a higher core run-rate in the fourth quarter adjusting for the incentive comp thing and that is just you are a kind of more normalized growth rate half of that higher level is that fair to say?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Exactly.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. All right, thanks a lot.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you.", "Operator:", "Our next question comes from Fred Cannon with KBW. Your line is open.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "All right thanks. A lot of my questions have been answered. Two quick ones, first your primarily I believe in the press release is at 4.0% in the industry, I believe the 3.25%. I was wondering if you're getting pushback apart from your clients as a result of holding your primary rate up high in the industry?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Fred, this is a Greg Becker. I guess as we think about pricing of real, we\u2019re really spending majority of our times thinking about pricing from a standpoint of risk for what balance and you can go look in the market and credit spreads overall including credits spreads are - I mean increasing pretty dramatically, so if you look at the total loan spreads that we have I would say number one, they are actually reasonable and there is actually we believe room for increases in that against the risk reward, its for not the overall credit exposure in the market, so we feel good about were are \u2013 our margins are and the upside that we have during course of the year.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Okay, thanks Greg. And then just one of Joe\u2019s questions to can I guess kind of two things on the expense control end, I guess could you give us some confidence that is if we see continually weak quarters like we have the fourth that the comp won\u2019t up until the budget is leveled, is there is some underlying expense control? Is there any concern that given that you have taken TARP that it will at least appear that you are paying a lot of the TARP preference in expenses?", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah Joe, or Fred excuse me, your first one is very difficult to hear you because although we can hear everybody else or something wrong with your - with all the - that can actually between you and us right this minute, so I believe I know what you asked and answer what I thought you asked and you tell me if I give you the right answer but the \u2013 the bulk of our the vast majority of any expense growth that we are anticipating in 2009 is in infrastructure IT backbone and product that is not in headcount.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "", "Okay and then in terms so but that would imply then Ken that if we do have a shortfall in revenue like you did in the fourth quarter, you wouldn\u2019t have the ability to adjust expenses?", "Ken Wilcox", "No, on to the contrary, we have the ability because it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s what in either case whether you are talking about the investment in product and IT infrastructure or whether you are talking about headcount, you always have the option of making adjustments but I think that if we did run into the kinds of difficulties that you are implying that we always have the option and is probably much much easier if your growth and expenses on the project side as opposed to the people side is much - much easier I would I think to marginally back. So I think the answer is that we definitely are going to do our best on the expense side and if the picture evolves in a way that suggested it would be prudent and marginally fair you can be assured that we will do so.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Okay.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thanks Fred.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Abbott with FBR. Your line is open.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Yeah, hi good evening.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hello James.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Quick question on - you touched on this is a little bit earlier, I was wondering if you could give us some of the loss assumptions that helped you arrive at the 7, I believe the 7.4 or 7.4 million net charge-offs on HRJ? What sort of assumptions were you using on that discounted cash flow and so forth?", "Dave Jones", "James this is Dave and I am not sure that was the client confidentiality information that we\u2019ve as an obligation that I want to need to get into that much detail.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Okay.", "Greg Becker", "James, this is Greg Becker. The other part is looking at the whole both charge-offs and reserves and looking at that on a combined basis that's really the best way to look at it so, between the two it\u2019s roughly $30 million.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co", "Okay. So you\u2019ve collected chance so your are down to roughly $58 or $59 million, you charged-off 7, so 50 million and then the additional reserves and then you feel like you've got the losses covered through that announce, is that correct? So, we should expect that to run through the charge-offs than that \u2013 is that a fair way of seeing that", "Dave Jones", "And James this is Dave. The analysis that we have to do would required us to think about that cash flow stream collections down the road on a net present value basis and to be thinking about it from reasonable, sometimes on the conservative side. So, I would not want to suggest that the reserves are going to run through the charge-offs and we are going to do everything we can to as quickly as we can collect all of the monies that are due us, but there are risk inherent in that process and it is incumbent upon us to have a reserve for those risk and thus we do.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay.", "Ken Wilcox", "Sure, if I could just add to this James, this is Ken, that the reserves are there in the case that we are fail to achieve but, we hope to achieve not because we anticipate that we will fail to achieve but we hope to achieve.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Understood. Okay, thank you and then on a \u2013 another questions on the asset side of venture capital firms because they are weaker companies, what are you hearing in that regard obviously, the early stage companies have been weaker as this has been earlier - discussed earlier on the call but are you hearing that the venture capital firms are trying their best to keep the commitments going or are they now making the decision that we got to cut a couple of companies loose from the portfolio and so what are you hearing there.", "Greg Becker", "So, James this is Greg again. Clearly the venture capitalists are looking at their portfolio and making decisions about which ones are going to be good performers and survivors in this market. So we are seeing some of that I think, it won\u2019t be as dramatic as what you read in the press and the magazines out there, venture capital is half capital, there has been a fair amount of money that\u2019s been raised. Even the numbers that Ken quoted when you look to how much money was raised from venture capitalists last year, that\u2019s still a substantial amount of money, now they are going to be slower to deploy that. They are increasing their reserves on a company-by-company basis to keep them \u2013 to support them longer. All those things are going to our analysis of the risk of the early stage portfolio. So, yes we\u2019re seeing some of that on one hand and the other hand there is still a fair amount of money out there to invest in early stage companies.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "And that\u2019s a little bit of a change from maybe three months ago though I think as I ask this kind of question over few times over a period of time but, is that correct is that maybe three months ago they were still trying to hold down and neither cutting back or is that my mistaken in that.", "Greg Becker ", "Yeah this is Greg, again James and I would absolutely agree with you that there was a three significant change in attitude and perspective over the last 90-days. And we have saw that across, all our markets both domestically and even internationally. So, yeah it did change pretty roughly.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay.", "Mike Descheneaux", "If I can just add to that I would like to underscore that because in the same way and I know all of you look at all sorts different things and you are familiar with the much wider variety of industries and aspects of the markets probably than we are, but in the same way that you know noticed I think I find it across the board basis a sudden and more dramatic change in people to attitudes in October and November and has been drew prior to that \u2013 that has on \u2013 that has reached into our market as well, and it was I am just as sudden and unexpected for us as it was for yield. When I say \u2013 when I say that I obviously everybody who pay any attention to the economy has note a shifts, but I think everybody notice that function shift in October and November.", "James Abbott \u2013 Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Co.", "Okay, well good luck with those of the deposit balances that should be an nice offset to some of the credit, so good luck with that.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thanks a lot James.", "Greg Becker ", "Thanks James", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari with JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi just I have a quick follow-up. And you deserve a couple of housekeeping things, what was the amount of the IC comp reversal in the fourth quarter?", "Mike Descheneaux", "John this is Mike Descheneaux, we will have that more in our MD&A section when we release the 10-K but, it was approximately around that 24 or $25 million mark, pretax of course.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "", "Okay.", "", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "So we will give you in our SEC upcoming, SEC filings. ", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "All right, and then in other housekeeping one. How much was that existing specific reserve for entire bounds. What is the amount you are using for that just for makes rather right calculation?", "Mike Descheneaux", "On the specific reserves amount.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Yeah in terms of your \u2013 yeah just looking at your outlook on credit, you give the outlook for the \u2013 for loan loss reserve and in that you said exclusive of specific reserves for impaired loans.", "Dave Jones", "Hello and this is Dave Jones, and the reserve for impaired loans is approximately $23 million.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "I am sorry you will tell the amount again.", "Dave Jones", "23.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay. All right, good. And then lastly I know this one will probably more challenging to help me always but, and I am just trying to look at what type of run-rate going into next year on a core basis given in your guidance in terms of EPS and just looking at a more normalized level here giving your guidance on I guess some comment with EPS and 30 to 40 set range on the quarterly basis. But, I don\u2019t know if there is any way you can give us any type of expectation on a EPS level here you given all the moving parts is there way you can help us on a moment.", "Mike Descheneaux", "John, this is Mike Descheneaux. As you know we don\u2019t provide the guidance on EPS and, again what we try to do this quarter is really help you guys out a lot by giving a lot more inside on this, but, again this at this point we would \u2013 we are not going comment on that.", "John Pancari \u2013 JP Morgan", "All right. Good try, thanks.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Al right thanks John. Nice try though.", "Operator", "", "This concludes the question-and-answer portion of today\u2019s call.

(Operator Instructions). Thank you. Ms. O'Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you. Today Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO; and Mike Descheneaux our Chief Financial Officer will discuss SVB's first quarter 2009 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of the management team will be available to take your questions.", "I would like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure. This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws including without limitation financial guidance for the full year 2008.", "Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts, such statements are just predictions and actual events or results may differ materially.

This presentation may also contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures. A presentation of and reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures could be found in our press release.", "Now I would like to turn the call over to Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Good afternoon every body. Thanks for joining us today to discuss our first quarter financial results. This was no doubt a disappointing quarter for SVB Financial Group. Today we announced a $10.5 million loss for the first quarter of 2009. Certainly not the way we were hoping to start the year.", "It continues to be apparent that the larger economy is spilling over into our space. More so than in the past recessions. This has impacted our clients, our partners in the venture capital industry, and of course, SVB itself. Mike will go into more detail on the specific drivers of the loss, but I will briefly share my observations on a few of the events of the past quarter.", "First, on the subject of credit. Almost three quarters of our provision was attributable to two medium sized loans both of which were in our comfort zone from a size perspective. The remainder of our losses were comprised of a number of smaller loans to smaller companies, which is consistent with our previously disclosed expectations.", "Second, on the subject of SVB capital, as long as the economy continues to weaken our venture investments will continue to be pressured. This is something we know to expect and while it is difficult in the near term it does not change our view that over the long-term SVB capital is an important part of our business.", "Finally, our net interest margins suffered from the tremendous success of our deposit raising initiatives. Unfortunately, to gain margin we would have to immediately invest those excess funds almost two years out on the curve.", "At this point we feel that would not be prudent. Hopefully over time and as things stabilize we will get more of a sense of how long these excess funds will be with us and we will get more comfortable going out on the curve to get a better margin. Mike will discuss this more in his comments.", "I want to take a moment before I go on to my other thoughts about the quarter to talk about loans, specially \"large loans\" or \"big credits.\" I want to talk about both why it makes sense for us to do them and how we handle them responsibly.", "As you know, virtually all of our clients begin with us in their early stages when their credit needs are small. Over time and as we have expanded our products at, we have been able to accommodate their growth needs which has allowed us to keep these clients with us longer and many of them have stayed with us longer.", "A byproduct of keeping our clients longer, as well as our focused efforts to go upstream is that we end up with some larger credit facilities as their credit needs expand. Another byproduct of keeping our clients longer is that as they grow they often buy more and more products than they did when they were smaller which of course for us is good.", "When their credit needs get to be too big, we often bring in other banks to help us meet the client's needs. However, we seldom bring in more than one or two other banks in such scenarios. And if a credit ever gets larger than we are comfortable with, we sometimes even consider gracefully bowing out of the deal at some point.", "Comfort levels depend on a number of factors beyond just size, including the sector a company is in and many other characteristic unique to the individual company in question. Large loans are and will continue to be part of our strategy and we will continue to apply our disciplined approach to these.", "Now, the quarter had its bright spots as well and I would like to highlight a few of them. First, we continued to have success attracting deposits to the balance sheet. Average deposits grew by $2.5 billion all the way up to $7.93 billion.", "I'd also like to highlight our expenses from Q1 of '08 to Q1 of '09 expenses are actually 1% lower excluding minority interest and goodwill. In addition, today we are decreasing our outlook for expense growth for the whole year. And in addition to that we are continuing to grow market share. At the end of 2008 our market share had grown in every industry we serve and we anticipate that trend continuing throughout 2009.", "Also, we are well capitalized. We have ample liquidity. Our balance sheet is strong and we are lending. And we feel good about the new loans we are making. We acquired 157 new active borrowers in the first quarter which contributed $219 million to our loans outstanding. And because we are actively lending we are helping businesses grow and thus keeping people in jobs. Only when those three things across the United States will the economy stabilize.", "Now, there could be no doubts we are in a period of market dislocation and while that is certainly presenting us with a chair of challenges, we also see numerous opportunities in this chaos. Because of the strength I've just highlighted I believe that relative to our competitors we are in a stronger position to grow our business. There is opportunity in the market and we are looking to seize on it.", "I want to close by sharing my views on the venture industry. And I know that it is a topic that's on the minds of many of you. As many of you know I have been doing this now for 27 straight years and I have been through my share of booms and busts in the venture industry. Of the many things I've learned one thing I know to be true and that is that the venture capital industry is continually evolving. This is especially apparent during times like this.", "A few things we are seeing today. First, the limited partner base of the venture model itself is evolving. We are seeing some of the more traditional sources of funds such as endowments losing steam, but in their place are coming new sources of capital such as pension funds and sovereign wealth funds which have ample dry powder and are looking to invest.", "Second, the venture market is becoming increasingly global, whereas the VC market in the US may be in a down cycle its forging ahead in other areas of the world. China would be a noticeable example.", "Third, the sectors receiving VC attention are evolving as well while electronics may be on the decline, clean tech and life sciences are definitely growing. We have specific strategies and dedicated teams focused on these specific industries.", "Finally, while we are seeing some changes in the venture model and in the venture industry, I believe the fundamentals remain strong. Those fundamentals are smart people, good ideas and money to support them. So, I'd like to close my portion today by again thanking the men and women of SVB Financial Group. I know you are out there and I want you to know, your hard work and dedication in these challenging times makes me incredibly proud to be a part of this fine team.", "And with that I'd like to pass it to our CFO, Michael Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "", "Thank you, Ken. And thank you everyone for joining us today. As Ken noted, in the first quarter of 2009 we reported a net loss of $10.5 million or $0.32 per share compared to net income of $1.4 million and $0.04 per share in the fourth quarter of 2008.", "There are six key highlights from the quarter. One credit quality. Two, venture capital and private equity investments. Three, deposit growth and net interest margin. Four, loans. Five, non-interest expense. And finally Number six, capital.", "I will comment on each highlight and provide you with our updated 2009 outlook. Let's start with credit quality. We recorded an elevated provision for loan losses of $43.5 million in the first quarter, primarily because of charge-offs and reserves related to two loans to hardware clients, which felt the impact of the deteriorating economy as well as certain loans in our early stage portfolio.", "This elevated provision drove our allowance for loan losses from 1.93% to 2.18% of total gross loans. Clearly, the economic environment is affecting our clients and for some it has impacted their ability to meet their loan obligations.", "We are reviewing our loan portfolio and meeting with our clients regularly to assess the impact of economic conditions and in light of the current economic down turn and we have enhanced our already rigorous credit monitoring processes. Nevertheless, we believe we have the right underwriting and credit monitoring controls in place and they have served us very well as our past credit quality has demonstrated.", "One driver of our first quarter results was a loss related to a decline in valuations of our venture capital and private-equity related investment securities. This decline resulted in a net loss of $4.6 million to us, net of non-controlling interests or minority interests as it was formerly known.", "This loss was primarily in certain investments in our managed funds of funds also known as our strategic investor\u2019s funds, a smaller portion related to our managed co-investment funds. The continued pull back in investing and fund-raising in the VC and private equities communities, particularly in Q4, as well as a lack of IPO and M&A activity and declines in the public equity markets have adversely affected valuations. As Ken-pointed out recovery in these funds will be tied to a recovery in the broader market.", "A third driver of our quarterly results was our exceptionally strong growth in average deposits of nearly 40% or $2.25 billion. As many of you may know, we have been focused for the last two years on offering the right mix of, on and off balance sheet deposit products to meet client's needs, while allowing us to attract enough deposits to keep pace with loan growth. We have been very successful in those efforts and first quarter deposit growth drove our average loan to deposit ratio to 64.5%.", "We had strong deposit growth as a result of our deposit initiatives, and because in this uncertain market environment many of our clients are opting for the safety of FDIC insured deposits instead of off-balance client investment funds.", "Given this significant increase in interest earning assets resulting from the increase in deposits and the low rate environment, our net interest margin declined to 3.97% in the first quarter.", "Other factors included a full quarter effect of a 100-basis point decrease in our prime lending rate in the fourth quarter and a decrease in average loan balances of $110 million in the first quarter.", "I would like to point out that although our net interest margin is down, our net interest income in Q1 '09 is up, in comparison to Q1 '08, even after a decline of 500 basis points in the Fed funds rate. While liquidity will remain a priority, we expect to invest approximately $1 billion to $2 billion of our excess cash over the course of the year at higher yields. And that process has already begun.", "During the first quarter a significant amount of our excess cash was held in highly liquid assets, namely fed deposits, where it earned 25 basis points. Given the lack of steepness in the yield curve we opted to maintain high liquidity, while we assessed the behaviors of these newly acquired deposits and the potential impact of an expiration of an unlimited FDIC insurance on demand deposit accounts.", "Our ability to bring on $3 billion in new deposits to our balance sheet in the past two quarters speaks to the strength of our deposit franchise. In addition, such strong liquidity is a powerful advantage in these economic times.", "Moving on to capital management; our capital ratios remain extremely strong. Our ratio of total common equity to total assets stood at 6.94%. Our ratio of total common equity to risk-weighted assets increased to 10.10% in the first quarter, primarily due to a decline in loan balances.", "Like many banks we have considered possible repayment of the preferred equity issued under the treasury's capital purchase program. While this is something we will continue evaluating, for the time being the additional equity enhances our flexibility and ability to lend comfortably in this challenging economic environment.", "Moving on to loans; as a result of decreases in our venture capital call lines of credit and general de-leveraging by our clients, average loans were lower by 2% in the first quarter by $5.51 billion. As you may recall, in January we said we expected balances and demand for capital call lines of credits to be lower, owing to limited VC fund racing and investment.", "Preliminary numbers indicate VC investment in the first quarter approached a 12-year low of between $3 billion and $4 billion, down significantly from Q4 when VC investments were $5.5 billion. Clearly, if inter-capital and private equity firms are funding fewer companies they will rely less on their capital call facilities.", "Overall the head winds for loan growth continue. Nevertheless, we continue to make new loans. If you consider that our loan portfolio has an average turnover of about 30%, just maintaining our current loan balances requires significant levels of new loan generation. ", "As Ken said we brought on 157 new borrowers in the first quarter who were responsible for $219 million in new borrowings. In the fourth quarter, those numbers were 270 new borrowers and $582 million in new borrowings. So while the size of our portfolio was somewhat smaller in dollars in the first quarter, we are adding new borrowers every day and targeting gains in market share.", "Although we expect much lower loan growth for 2009 relative to 2008 in this current environment, we are also seeing some additional loan pricing power, which we expect to help our net interest margin somewhat in the future quarters.", "The final item I'd like to address before moving on to the outlook is non-interest expense, which was high in the first quarter at $87.1 million as expected. There were three factors that contributed to the increase. The first was higher FDIC assessments owing to our higher average deposit balances and an increase in assessment fee rates.", "Going forward if we continue to maintain our current deposit levels, we expect these assessments will continue to impact our expenses. The second factor was a non-tax deductible goodwill impairment charge of $4.1 million related to our investment in eProsper, our data management firm. This charge reflects a lower revenue forecast. Nevertheless, we remain committed to developing eProsper and its client base.", "Finally, we had higher compensation and benefits expense, which should not be a surprise, given the fact that we significantly cutback on incentive compensation costs in the fourth quarter as a result of not achieving our financial goals in 2008, notwithstanding the fact that we had a return on equity in 2008 of 11.03%.", "In the end we reduced 2008 incentive compensation by $13.2 million resulting in extremely low compensation and benefits expense in the fourth quarter. The rest of the change is due to an increase in the average number of employees in the first quarter, as well as some seasonally higher items under other employ benefits, which are consistent with Q1 '08. ", "Now I would like to comment on our revised outlook for 2009. Our outlook reflects our expectations for the full year 2009 versus the full year 2008. Although we revisit and update our outlook each quarter it is an annual outlook.", "Several aspects of our 2009 outlook have changed, primarily because of lower VC investment levels as well as the impact of the continued economic downturn. I would encourage you to refer to our press release for additional information on our outlook. However, I would like to specifically comment on two points related to our 2009 outlook.", "My first point is that we expect credit quality to be under continued pressure in 2009 as a result of the continued economic downturn. We still expect that a majority of losses will likely come from our early stage portfolio. Additionally the expected increase in our allowance for loan losses for 2009 is largely driven by the impact of two loans in Q1.", "We do not expect the Q1 levels of net charge-offs to continue during the remainder of the year. Again, specific details related to the outlook for our allowance for loan losses and net charge-offs are provided in today's press release.", "My second point is that we have lowered our expectations for non-interest expense growth to a percentage rate in the high teens rather than the low 20s. Primarily owing to lower compensation and benefits expense resulting from lower than target financial performance.", "We expect this decrease to be offset partially by continued investment in our business that will allow us to continue to help our clients succeed and additionally significantly higher FDIC assessment fees. Particularly from the anticipated one-time fee assessment being opposed on all banks across the board. To put this in perspective, we expect FDIC assessment fees to increase more than $21 million or almost six times in 2009 in comparison to 2008.", "While we have taken the right steps in strengthening our capital and liquidity to withstand significant changes it goes without saying the economy is fragile. If the economy were to significantly deteriorate this year they could dramatically change our exceptions for our financial performance during the remainder of the year.", "As you can see, we expect 2009 to be challenging in terms of suppressed VC and private equity valuations, a lack of exit opportunities, loan growth, credit quality and continued pressure on our net interest margin. However, we believe net interest income will benefit from higher levels of excess deposits.", "We believe we are making sound decisions to continue to operate successfully and effectively in this environment and we are focused on ensuring continued prudent credit marketing as well as a strong balance sheet. While we and our clients are not immune to the problems plaguing the broader economy we remain confident in the effectiveness of our underwriting and will continue to be vigilant in monitoring our loan portfolio.", "We are taking advantage of our strong capital and liquidity to build our business and gain market share and we believe we are well positioned to weather the current market conditions. We will continue to focus on supporting our clients and on executing our long-term strategy regardless of market cycles.", "This concludes the review of our 2009 first quarter results. With that I would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Erika Penala. Your line is now open.", "Erika Penala - BAS-ML", "My question is, given your commentary on your industry, what is the dollar amount of commitment that SVB Capital is obligated to fund if called and of that amount how much has an LP committed to it versus if the commitment was made under a warehouse strategy?", "Ken Wilcox", "Erika, this is Ken. We can answer part of your question but we can't answer all of your question. You know, that the SEC rules don't let us talk about SVB Capital's fund-raising activities. That's really all there is to it. But I can tell you, however, is some of the information related to your question. So why don't we do our best with that. Mark, has the information right in front of him here. Mark?", "Mark MacLennan", "Erika, probably the best way is actually if you really look back at the 10-K at the end of the year and look at some of the contractual obligations for remaining unfunded commitments to wholly owned funds investment to that. And the numbers are approximately still the same of about 348 million fit into that category. And then I think on the following page we just give it our best expectation, which is still pretty accurate from where it is today of what we expect any capital calls under those facilities to be. And that was about 62 million for the remainder of 2009.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from James Abbott.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets & Co.", "I guess one of my first questions and then I will jump back in to the queue. The first question here is on the capital levels, obviously the industry is highly focused on tangible common equity and you have say little over $17 billion of deposits off balance sheet a lot of that coming back on balance sheet I suppose.", "So a little color around -- and I understand it is going into something that is risk weighted at zero. Just trying to understand the tangible common equity outlook here. What that ratio might do, what your expectations for those deposits, do you decide to shut it off, because you're getting so much on the balance sheet in such a rapid fashion. Just a little guidance on that, please.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, James, this is Greg Becker. Let me answer the first part of your question then Mike can answer the second part.", "Just regarding the deposits and overall client funds, really, the big jump is in deposits under the balance sheet was mainly driven by us eliminating the off balance sheet suite product in the fourth quarter, mainly in the fourth quarter and little bit in the first quarter. That was about $2.5 billion. And most of that money stuck on the balance sheet either in interest-bearing accounts or in DDA balances.", "So if you take that out, yes, we have seen some growth related to the FDIC insurance, but it is relatively small. That was the biggest change from he off balance sheet to the on balance sheet. And we don't expect any significant change other than that big what I would call almost a one-time event.", "Mike, you want to take the second part?", "Michael Descheneaux", "James, with respect to your second part of your question about, as far as the outlook for the tangible common equity. We don't have a specific target number that we have announced to the street, but when I think about it, you look at the numerator and the denominator.", "So as Greg pointed out, we are not really anticipating a whole lot of asset growth given the fact that the bulk of it has already occurred. So then you're left with the numerator the equity piece and I can assure you that we certainly are not expecting to get in the habits of reporting losses and equities.", "So if that number remains positive then you certainly should not really see any significant decrease in that TCE ratio as far as what we know today.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aaron Deer.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P.", "Mike, I was hoping to maybe just give us a sense. With the excess liquidity, just how quickly and how much do you expect to deploy over the next couple of quarters? I'm trying to gauge what kind of yields you're expecting to get on this, that sort of thing.", "Michael Descheneaux", "We are expecting to have put to work anywhere say that\u2019s $1 billion to $2 billion over the next several quarters. As you can appreciate the fact that you don't want to dump it all at one point for obvious risk reasons. As far as the yield that certainly is a direct function of how long you go out and what kind of duration risk you want to take.", "Given the fact that we do have that overhang to a certain degree on certain deposits of the FDIC insurance you've got to be a bit cautious not to go to too far out again for obvious reasons. But when you think about average durations that we typically have targeted in the past the duration of our securities tended to range between say two and three years.", "Right now if you look at that yield curve, I mean, you're looking at anywhere from say 2% to 3, 3.5% at least on some securities and you are possibly higher on some if you go out a little bit longer on the curve.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Morford.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Maybe its more of a clarification than anything, but your loan loss reserve ended the period at 2.18% of loans and looks like the guidance for the full year is 1.9% of loans. So does that suggest that charge-offs are going to -- you're going to bleed that down then through the balance of the year? And I guess related to this question, can you provide an update on the status of the HRJ sale and what the loss potential may be there?", "Dave Jones", "Joe, this is Dave. And let me answer the first part and Greg is in a great position to speak to the second part. So the answer to the question about the forecast, guidance for loan loss reserve is that the reserve that we have today, the 2.18% is comprised of reserves that we need for the last five component of the portfolio, the performing book of business and the analysis, the history we have had on those loan losses. And then there is the part of the reserve that is there for the impaired portfolio.", "So our expectation for the year is that we will address the issues that we have with the impaired portfolio. We will work that portfolio down. And as we do so the reserves required for the impaired portfolio will decline and that the overall allowance will decline.", "Greg Becker", "Joe to answer your second question, just an update on HRJ. As we have commented before, we have signed the letter of intent along with Capital Dynamics and then HRJ where Capital Dynamics would effectively take over HRJ. And as we commented before we don't expect, don't anticipate to take any additional reserves on the relationship, on the lending relationship than what we have taken to date and as we said, really nothing is really going to change until the deal closes with Capital Dynamics. Still we are on track and so no real change from that course that we mentioned before.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Zerbe.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Thanks. My main question is if you are investing in higher yielding securities, why do you expect the net interest margin to actually fall from current levels? I think your guidance is 3.7 to 4.0 and you were 3.97 in first quarter. And hen sort of my second sneaky question here is just why can't you just lower deposit rates on the excess cash?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, Ken, when you think about the excess cash that's being invested, given where the yield curve is today if I had previously, say, a 4.7 to 5% net interest margin and I'm taking a significant portion of our balance sheet and investing in assets that are only yielding 2% to 3% because that is what the yield \u2013its often given the [duration] of securities, by default that weighted average is going to lower your overall net interest margin.", "Operator", "Thank you. And your next question comes from\u2026.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Sorry, Operator. Let's try to finish the second part of Ken's sneaky question there.", "Operator", "I do apologize.", "Michael Descheneaux", "No problem.", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg, and I guess my response to that would be is, that we had higher interest bearing deposit rates in the fourth quarter. We had kept them in the first part of Q1 and we did drop them again towards the end of Q1. So you should see a lower average cost per interest bearing deposits in Q2 and going forward.", "And at the levels we are at right now we feel comfortable at those levels and I don't think we will be taking them down any more at least at this point.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Heck.", "John Heck - Deutsche Bank Americas", "Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I wonder if you guys can provide any details with respect to trends in early stages delinquencies during the quarter and then the roll rate trends as well on that?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave Jones , and in terms of delinquencies for early stage clients, we really don't have a history of seeing delinquencies. These companies receive their funding from the venture capitalists several months at a time and then at the end of that specific round they have to raise another round.", "So our experience is that delinquencies are not an issue. What will happen is, the company either gets the round of funding or doesn't. If the company doesn't get the round of funding then for us it pretty quickly turns into a nonperforming loan or a charge-off. And then the second part was about the role rate. Did I understand that?", "Michael Descheneaux", "We can't answer that.", "Dave Jones", "Okay. We can\u2019t that.  I'm not sure I understand the role rate.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Operator, can you unmute his line so we can clarify the question?", "Operator", "Yes, ma'am, one moment.", "Michael Descheneaux", "John, are you there?", "Operator", "His line has disconnected.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Okay, perhaps he will get back in the queue and we will move on to the next question.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Fred Cannon.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Thanks. And good afternoon.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Hello, Fred.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "I wanted to ask about your loan growth and your guidance on that. Usually you pointed to the average loan levels during the quarter but I do note that the end of period level was down from the average and down 10% from the end of the year. Was there something that particularly depressed the end of period loan levels this quarter?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave. Thanks, Fred. And no, there wasn't anything that particularly depressed the end of period. The last couple of days had more or less the same behavior that we see in most quarters. What we had seen in the quarter was a reduced utilization under the venture capital of the private equity venture capital call lines.", "So two things were going on there. One is, there were fewer companies that they were funding and then when they did fund a company they were funding in smaller amounts, given that they had led management to reduce their expenses and their cash requirement. So that was a significant part of the reduced loans and we saw that pretty much throughout the quarter.", "Greg Becker", "Fred, just to add-on, this is Greg. We definitely saw companies in addition to what Dave described just generally de-leveraging their own balance sheet, so if they had ample cash, ample liquidity, they were reducing loans outstanding in some case. And the other part to point out, I would say, is for us much like I would say, that the venture capitalists in the end of Q4 and the beginning of Q3 kind of hit the pause button on investments.", "We I would say put the pause button as well and had our teams really spend a lot of time on portfolio management as you would expect and so as you're doing that it's hard to do all things at the same time. So as you intensely review the portfolio it is not as easy going out and looking for new business.", "So as we have gotten our arms around the portfolio more and our teams have, we expect to build that pipeline back up and feel it is a good time to be out in the market, looking to add new clients as our competitors have gotten a little weaker. So I think that's the reason we expect that although it was down in Q1 we expect some nominal growth for the balance of the year.", "Operator", "We have John Heck to further elaborate on his question.", "John Heck - Deutsche Bank Americas", "Thank you, guys, for allowing me to do this. The elaboration would be, you suggested that in the early stage technology, just by the nature of the loans you might not have an early stage delinquency, but what about in the category that you might classify as business risk or things like the premium wineries? Do you see any early stage delinquency trends as well or would that offset be similar to the early stage technology companies?", "Dave Jones", "Thank you very much for the clarification. And this is Dave. So, the answer is no, we are not seeing an escalation in delinquency. It is the nature of the bank's history being balance sheet lenders that we haven't seen a lot in the form of delinquency. We had $3 million of over 90 days that was well secured in the process of collection, but the overall level really 1 to 89 days was in a very normal range, even in much healthier economic environments.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Erika Penala for a follow-up.", "Erika Penala \u2013 BAS-ML", "Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on my first question. When you say that $348 million of SVB Capital's obligations are unfunded, is that the same as not having an LP committed to fund those obligations?", "Mark MacLennan", "Erika this is Mark MacLennan again. No, it doesn\u2019t. That just relates to our total unfunded commitments of all commitments that we have made under our various funding program.", "Operator", "Our next question is a follow-up from James Abbott.", "James Abbott - FBR Capital Markets & Co", "Hi. This is a credit question on early stage loans. Just wondering if obviously you're tracking the cash balance sheets and the cash burn rates of your early stage companies and I'm wondering how they are looking in terms of some of the companies that are on the bubble, if you will, that are perhaps a little closer to defaults or three months away perhaps from needing that next round of financing and how things are looking there? Akin to a watch list, if you will, of those types of loans.", "Dave Jones", "James, this is Dave. And the answer to that is that we continue to see a roughly equal number of early stage companies that are coming due for their next round of venture funding. As we saw in the fourth quarter, as we saw in the first quarter. So a couple of things that we are seeing that are different.", "In the fourth quarter action was nonexistent. So everybody froze seemingly in the fourth quarter very few companies received money, a little bit or a lot. In the first quarter we saw the activity of companies receiving their rounds of funding pick up. In the first few weeks of the second quarter we are seeing roughly the same volume of grounds closing as we did in the first quarter.", "The information that we are getting in our conversations both with the venture capitalists and with client management teams would indicate that many other rounds are imminent and by imminent I mean over the balance of this quarter.", "We will continue to see this quarter, and third quarter, fourth quarter, an attrition within the early stage portfolio. So there will be continuing distress in that segment of the portfolio and that I think is consistent with the guidance that we have given that that would say that a significant part of the loan loss forecast for the balance of the year is expected to be consumed by the early stage client portfolio.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Al Savastano.", "Al Savastano - Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Just a silly question here. Could you give us the amount of specific reserves. How much reserves are left on HRJ?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave. I don't think that we want to get into exactly that much information. What we had reserved for the fourth quarter is really the same amount that we have as of the March 31 period. And as Greg has indicated the transaction that is working presently if closed as discussed would not require the further provisioning consumption of the allowance for the loss reserve.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from Joe Morford.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Maybe just to follow up on Erika's question more directly. There is a story going around today from private equity insiders saying that you have made $200 million of private equity fund commitments you have not been able to raise the funds to support and that you are looking at maybe selling them in a secondary, $0.20, $0.30 on the dollar is kind of the bids. Now can you confirm this story and what is the actual exposure and potential loss here?", "Ken Wilcox", "So, Joe, this is Ken again. I want to go back at least in part to what I was saying before and remind you that, as all of you know the SEC rules don't really let us talk about SVB capital fund-raising activities and that\u2019s the way it is. What I can tell you is that that article that you're referring to is misleading and it also contains a number of inaccuracies. ", "And I would also like to point out that we describe these investments in our 10-K both in the MD&A and in the risk factors and I might encourage everybody to take a look at that document and not to an article like the one that you're referencing, Joe.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Do you want to use this forum to clarify any of these inaccuracies at all or...?", "Ken Wilcox", "If I do that I think I'm doing exactly what I'm not supposed to do.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay, fine.", "Ken Wilcox", "You also know that we just are not supposed to be publishing or talking about fund-raising of this sort publicly and you also know that our balance sheet puts us in a very strong position and I can assure you that if the rumors in that article were correct, we would already have disclosed what the article said.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks, Ken.", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah.", "Operator", "There are no further questions in queue. I would like to turn it over to Mr. Wilcox for closing remarks.", "Ken Wilcox", "Well, thank you very much. Thank you all of you for joining us with today. I just really wanted to close by saying that while we expect the year to continue to be challenging and I think you do too, we also expect to emerge from this very difficult market cycle with greater market share and we are certainly ready to take advantage of the upside potential that will present itself as the economy recovers.", "So we continue to be bullish about our long-term future and I thank you very much for being with us today.

(Operator Instructions). Thank you. Its now my privilege to turn the conference over to our first speaker Ms. Meghan O'Leary. Please go ahead.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you. Today Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO; and Mike Descheneaux our Chief Financial Officer will discuss SVB's second 2009 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of our management team will be available to take your questions.", "I would like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure.

I am proud to announce that we earned $0.24 this quarter, considerably above what we believe to have been the street\u2019s consensus. A large part of the difference is due to better performance than expected, higher deposit levels, better use of those deposits, better pricing on our loans than expected, fewer loan losses and so on.", "Generally speaking we are, I believe, doing better than either we or for that matter you expected and we expect to be doing even better in the second half of this year. But let me be more specific, and in doing so let me distinguish between the business cycle on the one hand and some of the longer term changes we see taking place in our markets on the other.", "Purely from the point of view of the business cycle, our belief is as follows: The worst is likely behind us or in a worst case, we are in the middle of it right now and it will be behind us by the time we hold this call again next quarter. That\u2019s what we believe.", "Further, we are anticipating gradual and continuous although certainly not dramatic improvement over the course of the next several quarters. That\u2019s what we believe, based on what see happening around us and in the portfolio today. ", "Now that\u2019s all very general and it relates pretty much exclusively to the business cycle itself. So this time, I would like to go one step further and talk a little bit about some of the major changes that we see taking place in our markets. What implications these changes have for us and what we are doing to address them.", "These will all be developments that we have been observing for some number of years already and for which we have been preparing ourselves, piece by piece for the past several quarters.", "In total, I would like to discuss five significant developments. Number one, the venture industry is evolving and at least initially this evolution seems to involve lower levels of investment than we have seen for some time now. Venture capitalists are experiencing fewer exits in either the form of IPOs or even M&A transactions. And the ones they are experiencing are at lower valuations than has been true for some time.", "As a result, there returns to LPs are lower as well. Accordingly, many of them are less able to raise new funds. Consequently, many of these VCs are investing less money in their existing portfolio of companies and of course, founding fewer new companies as well. In general the venture-backed portion of our portfolio is shrinking, although our market share in that sector is increasing.", "On the other hand, many of our later-stage larger and often publicly traded companies have continued to grow and in many cases, actually flourished, in these past few years, the mix in our portfolio has shifted a little from earlier stage companies to later stage, larger and publicly traded ones.", "I want to be clear, we still focus on startups. And our market share, among startups is growing, but there are fewer of them today and many of them from prior years have grown into larger companies and are still with us. The result is interesting. Our market share amongst startups is now higher than ever, but our loan balances today are predominantly attributable to the mid-sized and larger companies\u2019 end of the portfolio.", "While the bulk of our profitability, when I first became CEO nine years ago, came from earlier stage companies. Today, as you might expect, the bulk of our profitability comes from later stage, larger, privately held companies and publicly traded ones.", "Number two, the companies that we work with are going overseas earlier and doing a lot more and different things overseas than would been true just a decade ago. It is always been true that venture-backed technology companies have on average begun selling products overseas, much earlier in their life-cycles than most other kinds of companies. But in this past decade, with the sudden and unexpected emergence of both China and India, and as the technology industry, both on the producer and on the consumer side has spread itself out from the US to many other countries, two big things have happened. ", "First our companies are not just selling products overseas early in their life cycles, now they are also sourcing talent, raising capital, acquiring technology and establishing beachheads overseas as well in many different places and much earlier than its ever been true in the past. And as you would expect an even higher percentage of their sales are now overseas and much earlier than what have been true a decade ago.", "Today most of the companies we work with have a global orientation. And accordingly we have become increasingly global in our orientation as well. We have in the course of these past few years not only established beachheads ourselves in a number of key countries, but we have overtime expanded our ability to deliver relevant products to those beachheads as well. In short, we are facilitating this trend that we are seeing in the market. To not do so would be a mistake and if we hadn\u2019t done so we would be far less relevant to our target market today than we are.", "Number three, the kinds of the companies that are attracting investment dollars today are different from the kinds of companies that we are doing so only a few years ago. We see more and more money flowing into alternative energy sources, natural resource management, genomics, broadband enhancements and applications and advance materials and proportionally less into some of the niches that were most prominent in years gone by. Accordingly, we have developed expertise in these new arenas and we will continue to do so as the market further evolves. Again, not to do so, would be a mistake and if we haven\u2019t done so we would be far less relevant to our target market today than we are.", "Number four, interest rates are low and in my opinion are likely to stay low for some considerable amount of time, as the Fed seems to be more worried about deflation than inflation and under any circumstances, does not want to dampen the flames of economic activity. As a result, we do not forecast any significant improvements in them for some period of time. There will of course be minor improvements as we continue to invest larger amounts of our excess cash in somewhat higher yielding instruments than Fed funds.", "Under these circumstances, value pricing and expense control are more important than ever. Accordingly, we have been keenly focused on both of these for a number of quarters now and intend to continue to do so.", "Number five; increasingly the companies that we work with are looking for advice in this increasingly complex, competitive and regulated world. Accordingly, we have devoted a good deal of time in these past few quarters to developing ways in which we can take the data that we generate in the course of banking, fully half of the venture back companies in the United States and a number outside the US and turning that data into information that our clients find useful.", "This data involves things like evaluations as well as operating metrics and the companies that we work with are finding both of these useful. We believe that this aspect of our business will, over time, not only further distinguish us from our competition but could generate meaningful revenues as well.", "Our responses to these trends coupled with our continued emphasis on helping our clients succeed have resulted in a measurable increase in our market share in these past several quarters.", "Now, before turning the meeting over to Mike, I would like to mention a few things of a more tactical nature. One, we have closed HRJ. This is good for the shareholders. As we stated last quarter, we didn't expect any additional loan losses reserves and that is in fact the case, plus we have an opportunity now over time to actually recover some portion of the reserves or charge-offs we've already taken.", "Number two. We've made meaningful progress towards raising the funds that we need to accommodate the allocations we've obtained through SVB Capital and believe that we have a clear path to a successful resolution of this issue.", "Number three. In these passive quarters we've made progress on further improving our risk management systems in ways that we hope could make it easier for us to identify developing problems even earlier than we have in the past and thereby enable us to address such problems even more effectively.", "Number four. Our capital base as well as our liquidity position remained strong. Further, we've taken steps to improve our utilization of excess liquidity, which should over time provide additional benefit to our shareholders.", "Number five. Finally, we are continuing even in this very difficult environment to strengthen our systems and to include the very backbone of IT infrastructure. This too puts us in an even better position to compete in the future.", "We are still building our organization for the long haul. Over the long haul, innovation will continue to play a pivotal role not only here in the United States, but we believe in the rest of the world as well. We are here to facilitate that development.", "With that I would like to turn the meeting over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Ken and thank you everyone for joining us today. As Ken said, in the second quarter 2009, we reported net income available to common stock holders of $7.8 million, equivalent of $0.24 per share.", "Although our performance improved in Q2, we continued to feel the effects of the economic downturn across our businesses, most particularly in lower loan balances and higher credit costs. However, there are some early signs that the economy maybe nearing a bottom, although it would not be surprising if we bump along the bottom for sometime before things improve.", "I would like to highlight six items; one, credit quality; two, net interest income and net interest margin; three, loan balances; four, non-interest income; five, non-interest expense; and finally number six, capital. After that, I will also provide you with our updated 2009 outlook.", "First off is, credit quality. Our credit quality in the second quarter was in line with expectations we said in April, the result of our continued diligent in proactively managing our portfolio. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $21.4 million in the second quarter, which is significantly lower than the $43.5 million provision recorded in the first quarter.", "The second quarter provision reflects gross loan charge-offs of $21.9 million, primarily from our life sciences, software and private client services portfolios. We set in prior calls that we expected all segments of our portfolio to be challenged by the current economy in 2009 with particular stress among our early stage clients.", "Our stance in the second quarter was consistent with that expectation with approximately $12 million in charge-offs coming from early stage borrowers. The ratio of net charge-offs to average gross loans improved significantly to 1.74% in the second quarter versus 3.21% in the first quarter. Year-to-date that ratio was 2.5%.", "Our allowance for loan losses increased minimally by $500,000 in the second quarter to 2.26% of total gross loans up from 2.18% in the first quarter. However, we expect the allowance for loan losses to improve during the remainder of the year.", "Non-performing loans did increase by $13.8 million in the second quarter to $111.5 million primarily from our software and private client services portfolios. Approximately $43 million of our non-performing loans relate to HRJ capital. As you will recall, in the first quarter of 2008 we recorded significant increases in net charge-offs and reserves related through loans to HRJ.", "As noted earlier, an independent asset management firm announced it would assume management of HRJ's funds. This transaction is a significant step towards bringing that matter to a close. We will finalize the numbers as part of our Q3 reporting and we expect a significant decline in non-performing loans as a result. Furthermore, we do not believe the resolution will have a material impact on our net income or provision. ", "On the subject of credit, I want to mention one important item that we expect to close on in the third quarter. During the third quarter 2009, we expect to complete a transaction that will result in a recovery of approximately $11.5 million on a pre-tax basis from a hardware loan that we charged-off in the first quarter of 2009.", "Next up is net interest income and our net interest margin. Although, our net interest margin declined from 3.97% to 3.71% in the second quarter, as expected, we were able to hold net interest income steady at $91.7 million; despite a significant decline in loan balances and higher deposit levels.", "There are three reasons why we were able to achieve this. Number one, we increased our investment portfolio by $580 million, generating 1.9 billion in additional interest income. ", "Two, we decreased interest expense by $1.2 million as a result of lowering rates on deposits in the first quarter to be more in line with the market rates.", "Three, we benefited from a decrease in interest expense of 900,000 on our long-term debt primarily as a result of lower LIBOR rates on the interest rates SWAP agreements we entered into in May 2007.", "I would like to note that we do expect our net interest margin to improve in the second half of the year. Average deposits grew $505 million to $8.4 billion, owing to the full quarter effect of our discontinuation of a third party off balance sheet suite product and clients opting for the safety of FDIC insurance demand deposits. ", "In making investments, we continue to emphasize liquidity. Year-to-date, we have increased our investment portfolio by more than $1 billion and we expect to invest a further $500 million to $1 billion during the remainder of 2009. We still have significant levels of excess cash, owing to the influx of over $2 billion in deposits on to the balance sheet in the last two quarters, a significant portion of which flow to demand deposits because of the FDIC insurance.", "However, we expect clients to begin moving a significant amount of these funds out of demand deposits into interest bank accounts or off balance sheet funds when the FDICs insurance of demand deposit expires or when interest rates begin to rise. In the meantime, they remain in highly liquid overnight deposits.", "One interesting item I would like to highlight is that, despite a decline of 500 basis points in the Fed funds rate in the last 22 months, our net interest income in the second quarter, was up nearly 6% in comparison to the same quarter last year due mainly to growth in average interest earning assets.", "Now, I'd like to move on to loans. Although, we remained very active in the market, we are facing challenges growing and even maintaining our loan balances. The two key headwinds have been deleveraging by our clients and standard term loan repayments.", "In the second quarter these activities resulted in lower average loan balances of $4.8 billion, a decline of 6.6% from the first quarter. The decline is coming primarily from our later states software and hardware clients as well as private client services. However, I believe some perspective is in order specifically that for the first six months of 2009, loan balances were 17.3% higher than for the same period last year.", "While many companies are holding off on borrowing or do not need to borrow as much in this environment, we are still actively adding new clients and making new loans. In the second quarter we added 234 new borrowers who added $236 million in new loan balances. That compares to 157 new borrowers contributing $219 million in the first quarter. These borrowers were primarily from our private equity, venture capital and later stage hardware and software portfolios. ", "Now, let me turn to non-GAAP, non-interest income, net of non-controlling interests. While it was higher quarter-over-quarter at $34.4 million versus $25 million in the first quarter, it continues to be impacted by declining valuations in our private equity and venture capital investments, lower warrant income and lower fee revenues.", "Much of the improvement in non-interest income in the second quarter, related to lower aggregate losses on our venture capital and private equity investments in the second quarter. Additionally, we were aided by realized net gain of $1.2 million on warrants due primarily to increases in valuations on warrants held in several public companies. However, private company warrant valuations were actually lower during the quarter.", "Continued economic headwinds push fees on products and services down to $22.1 million, versus $23.4 million in the first quarter. These include client investment and letter of credit fees both of which were down in the quarter as well as FX fees and deposit service charges which remained flat. This number does not include credit card fees, which appears as a new category in our press release.", "As you may recall, during the second quarter, we announced we would bring our credit card business in-house. These credit card fees offered a bright spot in the second quarter, growing from $1.5 million in Q1 to $3 million in Q2. With them fee based income was $25.1 million in the second quarter, versus $24.9 million in the first quarter.", "A final note on non-interest income; during the second quarter of 2009 we determined that we had incorrectly recognized certain gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts in prior periods. As a result, we reversed $3.8 million in after-tax, FX gains and losses the equivalent of $0.11 per share from prior quarters. The  specific periods impacted were the first quarter of 2009 and the full years 2008 and 2007. This area had no impact on the second quarter. We consider these reversals to be immaterial and have revised the financial results for those prior periods. You will find more details on these revisions in our press release.", "Turning to expenses; we recorded non-interest expense of $89 million compared to $87.1 million in the first quarter. Our expenses included an increase in FDIC assessments of $5.9 million largely as a result of a $5.0 million special assessment fee as well as from higher average deposit balances.", "Compensation expenses were down slightly in the second quarter primarily because of higher payroll taxes and seasonal accruals in the first quarter. We maintained total personnel at 1,260 compared to 1,262 in the first quarter. You may recall also that we had a $4.1 million non-tax deductible goodwill charge in the first quarter and the absence of a similar charge in the second quarter also helped our expenses.", "Moving on to capital; our ratios remain strong with Tier 1 leverage at 9.88%. Our ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets was slightly low in the second quarter at 6.94% owing to continue growth in assets driven by increases in deposits. ", "Our ratio of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets increased to 10.54% primarily due to lower loan balances. Given the recent growth of our assets and their related composition, we pay particular attention to tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets, as we have a significant amount of assets in low risk-weighted asset classes. We feel tangible common equity to risk-weighted asset is a more reasonable reflection of our risk profile than other capital ratios.", "We have been asked frequently whether we plan to repay the funds we received from the Treasury\u2019s capital purchase program in the near future. Let me say that we continually evaluate this possibility. However, there are various factors that influence our thinking on this matter. First, is overall economic performance and outlook; second is the current performance and future outlook for our credit quality; and third is a ready availability of debts and equity to financial institutions like us.", "We would like to see further improvements and stability in these factors before determining when we will repay the funds. For the time being, the additional equity enhances our flexibility and ability to do business comfortably in this challenging economic environment.", "Now, I would like to comment on our revised outlook for 2009. Our outlook reflects our expectations for the full year 2009 versus the full year 2009. Although, we revisit and update our outlook each quarter, it is an annual outlook. Several aspects of our 2009 outlook have changed primarily because of lower venture capital on investment levels as well as the impact of the continued economic downturn.", "With the exception of credit quality, I am going to talk only about the changes in our outlook from April 2009. Please refer to our press release for additional information. ", "One, we have lowered our expectations for loan balances based on market conditions as I discussed earlier. We now expect percentage increases in average loans to be in the mid-single digits, rather than the high-single digits. Two, we now expect the allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans to be in the range of 1.4% to 1.45%, excluding reserves for already impaired loans, primarily because we believe their credit quality for the remainder of 2009 will be more reflective of our second quarter results. Three, we have also lowered our outlook for aggregate fees on deposit services, lenders of credit and foreign exchange.", "We now expect a percentage decrease in the low-single digit for those fees in 2009, rather than an increase owing to general economic conditions. ", "Finally, point number four, we have improved our outlook for non-interest expense growth once again pay percentage rate in the mid-teams. ", "Primarily owing to lower compensation and benefits expensed, reflecting the impact of the economy on our results and lower than expected fees on the special FDIC assessment. ", "Nevertheless, year-to-date FDIC fees were significantly higher than we expected.", "We are maintaining our outlook on net charge-offs. We are still expecting net loan charge-off of between 1.75 to 1.8%, a figure that includes net charge-offs to June 30, but excludes potential charge-offs from already impaired loans. ", "Clearly, we see challenges in the remaining months of 2009, with headwinds from suppressed venture capital, valuations, a lack of exit opportunities for our clients, declining loan balances, pressure on the net interest margin from the low rate, environment and the continued need to aggressively monitor and manage credit quality. As we said last quarter, if the economy were to significantly deteriorate, it could change our expectations for the year.", "Nevertheless we do see opportunities for growth as well. Companies will continue to borrow, and we believe we will see meaningful future activity among mid and later staged companies, venture capital and private equity funds, renewing their investment activities by our focused organizations in our international expansion. We also continue to build our business, creating new revenue opportunities through adding new products and services designed to help our clients succeed domestically and around the world.", "In the meantime, we are focused on making the right decisions to help ensure our continued liability and strength in this challenging market. We have fortified our capital base and ensured we have ample liquidity.", "We have a strong balance sheet and we remain vigilant with regard to credit. We will continue to support our clients and execute on our long-term strategy regardless of market cycles.", "This concludes the review of our 2009 second quarter results.", "With that, I would like to ask the operator to open the call for questions and then Ken will provide some closing comments. Thank you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Joe Morford.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "", "Thanks. Nice quarter guys particularly on the credit front. Couple of questions. First, just really clarification on HRJ. I hear you that it doesn\u2019t impact the net income of the provision, what are your current expectations for any recoveries on the $7.5 million or so that you charged off and how much of any specific reserves would be freed up in the allowance and what would be the timing of that? Would that be third quarter as well?", "Dave Jones", "", "Joe this is Dave Jones and as indicated in Mike's remarks the near-term expectations of anything in HRJ are nominal. So the extent to which there could be a modest reversal of specific reserve for HRJ it would be very modest. This is my belief based on present understanding and the recovery opportunities are likely to be over an extended period of time. So I wouldn\u2019t anticipate anything in very near future.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Just one clarification, when we are saying nominal we are talking about the nominal impact of the provision or bottom line net income.", "Dave Jones", "", "Correct.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Can you talk a little bit more about the event that led to the large recovery coming through in the third quarter. Is that taken into account in the net charge-off guidance, which I think was 140 basis points for the second half of the year?", "Dave Jones", "", "This is Dave again. So we have a transaction that is presently in the works that would sell our debt position to another party and the information contained in the press release and in our comments today would reflect our confidence that the transaction is going to settle in the near-term.", "In terms of it being reflected. So the $11.5 million would represent over 20 basis points relative to our gross loans and it is one of the factors. So we have the 20 plus basis points reflected in the anticipated recovery. We have another 90 basis points roughly in specific reserves for impaired accounts, those account most likely to incur loss and then over and above that, is our guidance for 142, possibly 145 basis points.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that\u2019s helpful Dave and then lastly I guess on average loan growth, I see the guidance now is for mid-single digit growth for the full year but more specifically for the second half.", "Do you see continued declines in balances given all the trends you talked about in the operating environment? Are we getting closer to seeing those balances flatten out at all?", "Greg Becker", "Joe, this is Greg Becker. I think the guidance would point you for the second half of the year that we expect flat to slightly improved loan balances and part of this is we talked about last quarter, that first quarter was just so challenged where there were so many reasons that held off any loan growth and people making decisions.", "We see that changing modestly and really combining some additional capital, call borrowings, some corporate tech borrowings, some global growth, we think those are the things that will fuel a flattening, in fact a modest turnaround in net balance.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Aaron Deer.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "A question on the, I guess a client deposits. The off-balance sheet funds, look like they were down about $1.7 billion well on-balance sheet deposits were up about $0.5 billion, the delta between those, I guess by $1.2 billion, is that, is that represent the cash burn of the VC backed companies or is there something also going on there?", "Gregory Becker", "Yeah Aaron. This is Greg Becker again. And that's what we're saying. Again our market share is growing or we are adding clients and our belief is that it's really just the cash burn that our clients are experiencing and the fact that it's not being replenished at the same pace by future venture capital around this financing.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P", "Okay. And then, I am impressed that the private client services loss in the quarter, what type of loan was that and was, or loans, I guess and how is the dollar amount related to that?", "Dave Jones", "Aaron, this is Dave Jones. And it was a collection of loan losses, there were four or five different borrowers, with whom we took loan losses and the aggregate of the loan loss between the four or five borrowers was roughly $5 million.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P", "What it was, can you say what the, what it was for, specifically was it for properties or was it for, I guess some securities or what, what those private client loans are?", "Gregory Becker", "I think probably it would be best to generalize it as investments\u2026", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P", "Okay.", "Gregory Becker", "That the collective borrowers were making.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill & Partners L.P", "Okay. Thanks guys. Appreciate the help ", "", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Christopher Nolan.", "Christopher Nolan - Maxim Group", "Thank you. Why the reservation of second quarter given that the charge-offs ratio have improved so much in the guidance is for there seems to be a improved credit quality and lower reserve coverage?", "Dave Jones", "This is Dave, Chris. And in a sense what we are talking about I think you are focused on here is the percent of the portfolio that increased. When you look at the dollars and the reserve there is very insignificant change in dollars.", "So I think that the dollar level of the reserve reflects as we think that the second quarter performed to expectations. We think that we have a better sense of how a balance of the year and the foreseeable future will play out. So we are confident that we have an adequate reserve established.", "Christopher Nolan - Maxim Group", "Okay, and given the guidance for if I'm correct $1.45% loan loss reserve ratio for the second half of the year, is that correct Dave.", "Dave Jones", "No, I don\u2019t think so. Because what we have is that 1.4 to 1.45 plus, specific reserves which are roughly 90 basis points on the present portfolio. ", "Christopher Nolan - Maxim Group", "Great. Thanks for the clarification.", "Operator", "Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Mr. John Hecht..", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "", "Thanks very much and congratulations on executing a good quarter. You talked about the margin contraction based on some of the factors that we saw on the quarter including low interest rates, but you did see your yields improve during the quarter on the loan side. ", "And then given the right vending that occurred during the quarter, I am wondering if you could give us some color about how you were able to re-price some of the assets during the quarter?", "Greg Becker", "", "Yes, John this is Greg Becker. The increase in improvement of loan pricing I would characterize is modest. Obviously it will take even modest increases in pricing in this environment and most of its really re-pricing for the increased risk profile that we see generally speaking with the client base.", "So, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as a huge opportunity for us either this quarter or on a go forward basis but it did help to contribute to part of the lower decline that maybe was expected.", "John Heck - Deutsche Bank Americas", "", "Okay. As, just sort of a related follow-up on that, when you guys are coming to refinance situation with that earlier-stage company, whether it\u2019s a private equity or I guess this to be a venture capital kind of question, but even in the private equity segment when there is a refinance opportunity, how willing are the sponsors at this point that they need to add equity to help these organizations delever. Are you getting in sets that there is a greater willingness now or about where we were six months ago?", "Dave Jones", "", "And this is Dave, let me at least initiate the response on that. What we have seen here is a resurgence, modest I want to underscore but a resurgence and venture investment.", "So in the fourth quarter the community seemed to be frozen stiff and few investments occurred, but in the first quarter and arguably slightly more still in the second quarter the venture capitalist established their willingness to fund a company.", "Now, when you look at the venture capital activity, be mindful of the fact that the venture capitalists have encouraged their portfolio management teams to reduce their operating expenses, thus there is less money required for the operating company to get through another 10, 12, 18 months of operations.", "So we\u2019re seeing good activity. We clearly, in terms of our segment, of our portfolio, I saw over 60 different companies that closed on equity round during the second quarter and I\u2019m sure that there were a lot more that were not necessarily on my radar strength.", "John Heck - Deutsche Bank Americas", "And that was up dramatically from Q1 or just it had one year improvement?", "Dave Jones", "It was improvement and given where we are in the economy, certainly all the improvement is welcome and preferred.", "Greg Becker", "", "John, this is Greg, may be just to add on to it. if you look at the data that\u2019s come out although its preliminary from the different sources that attract venture fund inflow, it depends on which source you\u2019re looking at, its anywhere from a 15% to as much as a 30% improvement in dollars over Q1 and if you take that data and you [matched] it up against, kind of we have experienced in our portfolio that feels about a right level from an improvement perspective.", "Operator", "Okay, our next question comes from the line of John Pancari.", "John Pancari \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "", "I\u2019ll ask a question about a different portfolio for once here, can you talk a little bit about wine the premium wine portfolio, we\u2019ve been insuring a little bit and seen some select journal articles discussing the wine business in difficulty up there in California. Can you just give us some color on what you're seeing in your portfolio. ", "Dave Jones", "Again this is Dave. Let me offer a perspective. What we are seeing is that the overall volume of wine sales is trending down. And this is very reminiscent of what we saw after the last recession. So,  post 9/11 of 2001, we saw a decline in wine sales.", "What we are seeing is that clients with the higher dollar, the higher price point wine is generally more affected than their lower price point wines, so what they are loosing in revenue dollars also the high dollar wine, they are making up somewhat with the more moderate pricing wines. ", "So, our clients are being impacted, but the sense of it is that a trend line similar to what we saw through after, through and after the last recession could be a reasonable expectation of what we will see through and after this current recession.", "John Pancari \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "Can you give us a little bit of color in terms of the level non-accruals you may expect on portfolio or delinquencies or just given that as an idea of where that starting to trend. How that you said you are seeing that you are affected? Can you give us some color on that?", "Dave Jones", "Our level of non-accruals and past dues are very low, but historically in the wine portfolio, as with our technology portfolio, we do not see a large level of non-performing or past dues. What probably is more representative of the Company performance is our internal risk breakings. And certainly anybody with a one portfolio in these days should be expected to have a higher level of adversely rated credits and we have been seeing that.", "I think that there will continue to be some degradation in that portfolio. It is not clear that the current trend line in terms of non-performing and charge-offs will be different than last time and last time non-performing and charge-offs were very low.", "John Pancari \u2013 Fox-Pitt Kelton", "All right, and then the secondly, can you talk about your participated loan portfolio. Just curious an update in terms of the current trends you are seeing there.", "Dave Jones", "Sure. So, we continue to spend a significant amount of time looking at those credits and there has been none of the credits in that segment of the portfolio. Move from a pass rating to a more adverse rating over the last 90 days and the general client activity that we are seeing is that generally the clients are experiencing more revenue which obviously is better for them. So, that part of the portfolio is fine in my opinion.", "Operator", "Okay. It looks like our last question in the queue comes from Mr. Fred Cannon.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "Well, thanks. Most of my questions have been answered. But I just wanted to ask a more, perhaps my or kind of philosophical question on the balance sheet. We\u2019ve seen a huge transformation in the last year in the balance sheet with the loan to deposit ratio I think a year ago was 94% and currently its 52% in the current balance sheet, certainly from a liquidity and capital standpoint looks like a fortress balance sheet.", "As we go forward and I mean it sounded to me that a couple of things, number one is that, loans deposit ratio may well slip further and go below 50%. Number two is, at least in the main time until you can kind of get an all clear signal on the economy, you are probably going to maintain these strong levels of liquidity and capital.", "With that said, the question is kind of strategically, when would you guys like to see the balance sheet evolve to? Is it back to the future, kind of like the 1990 Silicon Valley balance sheet with a 50% loan deposit ratio and a bunch of securities or is it something more like we saw just a couple of years ago?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Alright, I think I know what your preference would be. So let me just answer that in three different ways. One is, the good news is that we have been, I would say amazingly successful at deposit raising and we may have overshot the mark. And so I think we would be interested in correcting that. But I think we are trying to look on the good side because not every organization has been quite that successful at raising deposits and I would like to at least feel good about the positive side of that development.", "But I do not recognize exactly what you mean and I can assure you that we are not targeting a loan to deposit ratio of 50 or lower or even 60. But we are aiming for something that is a little bit more optimal. Having said that, things are situational, meaning we are in the midst of a recession here and I think that when you are in the midst of a recession, responsible bankers seek to have fortress like balance sheets. ", "This balance sheet is in part a function of having been successful at raising deposits than we intended to be but its also in part an expression of our deliberate attempt to create a balance sheet that I think is appropriate to a recession of the magnitude of the one we\u2019re experiencing.", "So to certain extent, I think this makes perfect sense given where we are but your question really goes to normalization and under normal circumstances and in an economy that was more robust than the one we are in right now, we would hope to have a loan to deposit ratio that was more in the optimal range and the optimal range to my way of thinking is, 75 to 80 somewhere in there, maybe even, on some days 90.", "We don\u2019t want to sound like too nervous by going too much above that but on the other hand we don\u2019t want to make you too unhappy by being too much below it. We also under normal circumstances and in a more robust economy would try to optimize our capital as opposed to stock piling. But for the moment I don\u2019t think, I think it\u2019s good and responsible to have some more capital than you might not want to have in better times.", "Finally I will say that, we have come a long way over the years in terms of perfecting the tools that we can use to either bring deposits onto the balance sheet or move them more into the broker-dealer and you know that we don\u2019t have complete discretion in that regard, but we I think are getting better and better at achieving what we are hoping to achieve in terms of where the preponderance of the deposits are located and I think that in the coming quarters and coming years, we\u2019ll come up with tools that are even more effective at accomplishing what we are open to accomplish.", "So I think we\u2019ll do a better job of creating the optimal balance sheet, but once again I think its really relative to the state of the economy. So, I hope that helps, Fred.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "", "Yeah. That's very helpful Ken. Regarding to your last comments then as we, when we do normalize hopefully sooner rather than later, you will continue to pursue the kind of off-balance sheet management of the deposits that you tend to pull in at a rapid rate during the growing economy just as you did earlier in this decade?", "Ken Wilcox", "Well, absolutely Fred. I will say that we, a few years back discovered that our balance sheet could be source of profitability to and we have not lost interest in that concept.", "Fred Cannon - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods", "", "Okay thanks very much Ken.", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah. I think we are at the end of our line here, so I think I will just round-off by giving you a summary comment or do I want to reiterate that we are confident that we are moving in a good direction. I'd also like to repeat that we are in this for the long haul and over the long haul, we are convinced that the economy will improve and that the innovation space will continue to play a pivotal role not only here in the United States, but in the rest of the world as well.", "We are focused on responsible growth, risk mitigation, expense control and good balance sheet management and I'd like to conclude by thanking the 1,260 SVBers all of whom contributed each in their own way to our progress this quarter. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "", "Okay. This concludes today's SVB Financial Group's second quarter 2009 earnings conference call.

My name is Deanne and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone attorney to the SVB Financial Group Q1 2010 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to call \u2013 I'm sorry, all lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Ms. O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you. Today, Ken Wilcox, our President and CEO and Mike Descheneaux, our Chief Financial Officer, will discuss SVB's First Quarter 2010 performance and financial results. Following this presentation, members of our management team will be available to take your questions. I'd like to start the meeting by reading the Safe Harbor disclosure.", "This presentation contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws including without limitations financial guidance for future periods and the full year 2010. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. Such statements are just predictions and actual events or results may differ materially.

This presentation may also contain references to non-GAAP financial measures. The presentation of the reconciliations to most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our press release and now I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you, Meghan and thank you all for joining us today. SVB Financial Group reported a solid first quarter today, delivering earnings of $18.6 million or $0.44 per share and exceeding consensus estimates. These results were driven by our growing asset base fueled by deposits, better performance in our funds management business, a lower loan loss provision and improving credit quality. They were offset to some extent by lower loan balances and somewhat higher expenses.", "Our first quarter results reflect improvements we're seeing in our markets and our business metrics. While they have not yet translated into net loan growth, we believe it is only a matter of time and we are greatly encouraged by several recent developments.", "The first development is improving expectations for technology markets. Recent reports project that global information technology spending may increase as much as 8% in 2010. Some companies appear to be experiencing that growth already. IBM just announced a $2.6 billion profit in quarter-over-quarter growth. And Intel reported its best quarter ever, forecasting record profit margins for 2010. These companies demonstrate the resilience of the broader technology industry as up-to-date systems and software have long been a competitive necessity for many businesses.", "An improving technology market will undoubtedly benefit many smaller emerging companies as well as the established leaders. And that leads me to the second development about which I'm optimistic, improving venture capital investment levels and greater activity in the exit markets for venture back companies.", "Venture Investment in the first quarter was up 11% over a year ago at $4.71 billion, according to the most recent reports. That amount funded 597 rounds in the first quarter versus 522 rounds in the first quarter of 2009. In other words, a 14% increase. While Venture Capital Investment is still significantly lower than in many recent years, this modest improvement bodes well for our clients.", "The exit markets improved more significantly in the first quarter with nine venture backed IPOs, the most in any quarter since 2007. These companies raised $936 million, more than double the amount raised in the fourth quarter of 2009. There were also 111 mergers or acquisitions of venture backed companies, the highest number in any quarter since 1975.", "This increase in venture-backed exits has emerged after many successive quarters of anemic or non-existent exit activity. And it speaks to an improved outlook for fund raising as liquidity returns to the hands of limited partners. Of course, a single good quarter does not constitute a recovery but it's a good sign and we're encouraged by it.", "Our clients' confidence appears to be improving as well. This is the third development that makes me optimistic. In a survey, we recently conducted of our early stage clients, more than two-thirds said things were already better than last year and three quarters expect things to improve even more in the next 12 months.", "Indirectly, our lower charge-offs and .declining classified loan balances during the quarter suggest our clients are in better shape than they were a year ago. And our continuing deposit growth speaks to the fact that they have ample liquidity.", "As I said, we are optimistic about all of these developments and although they did not result in loan growth during the first quarter, they contributed to significant growth in our pipeline which I would describe as extremely strong at this point. We have not seen activity like this in quite a while.", "During the first quarter, we saw more traffic, had more definitive discussions and provided more term sheets to our current and prospective clients than we have in over a year and we continued to add new clients as we have throughout the downturn.", "Our credit client count is the highest, it has ever been. We certainly expect these developments to generate loan growth in the near term. At that point, we will benefit from the additional earnings power of higher loan balances and the market share gains we've achieved throughout the downturn and of course, at some point, we will also benefit from higher interest rates as well, I'm sure.", "In the meantime, we are doing everything we can to take advantage of the earnings potential offered by our excess liquidity even in this low rate environment. We increased our average interest earning investment securities by $715 million during the first quarter, after significantly increasing this portfolio in 2009 that in turn has helped our net interest income which has been significantly impacted by low interest rates.", "We remain one of the best capitalized banks in the industry with ratios that in many cases are more than double the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions. Nonetheless, the economy is still far from predictable and capital requirements for banks are likely to increase.", "We believe we are well prepared to adapt to those requirements while continuing to lay the foundation for future growth. On that point, I want to touch on a topic we are frequently asked about these days which is portfolio acquisition.", "We have said in the past that while we believe our growth will be primarily organic, we are prepared to acquire the right portfolio if it makes sense. There are a good number of high quality portfolios available in the market today which is another indicator of an improving economy. We have looked at a number of these portfolios in the past few months and will continue evaluating these potential acquisitions opportunistically.", "Let me close by saying that although a broad based economic recovery is expected to come slowly, we think all signs point to growing positive momentum and we're optimistic, not just because there are better years ahead, but because SVB Financial Group stands to benefit tremendously from the many incremental improvements we will see along the way. And with that I'd like to turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Ken, and thank you all for joining us today. As you heard from Ken, we had a solid quarter. We are seeing positive signs among our clients and strong momentum in the pipeline. There are five key topics I want to address today as I review our first quarter 2010 results. I will also update our outlook for 2010.", "First is the timing of our return to loan growth. We are seeing strong signs of growing momentum despite the fact that loan balances were down during the first quarter and credit line utilization remained lower than normal.", "Second is the increase in our interest earning assets. Clients continue to put deposits on the balance sheet in the first quarter and we further expanded our investment securities portfolio in order to put more of those funds to work.", "Third is continued credit quality improvement marked by lower gross charge-offs and higher recoveries. This also marks the third successive quarter we've seen lower classified loans.", "Forth is higher non-interest income driven primarily by gains in our venture capital and private equity related investments and fifth is expenses. As we predicted, they were higher in the first quarter due to our continued investment in people and projects. That said, they were still somewhat lower than we expected and we have slightly improved our expense outlook for the full year 2010.", "Let me start with loan growth. Average loan balances declined by $252 million or 5.8% to $4.1 billion. This decrease came primarily from lower utilization of our capital call lines of credit by our venture capital clients related to the still relatively slow pace of Venture Capital Investment.", "We believe these lines of credit will come back as venture capital funding activity increases. Let me explain why we are still optimistic about prospects for our loan growth. First, we expect the improving outlook for technology to translate into higher utilization rates as Ken outlined earlier.", "Our efforts to refine our relationship management according to client size and stage of life should increase this impact as we deliver increased value to our clients. Second, our pipeline grew by 25% in the first quarter and is at its highest level since 2008. Third, we are building momentum among our larger corporate clients, especially in biofinancing, and fourth, our international lending is building. We saw a nice pick up during the first quarter and we expect that momentum to continue.", "So we have a lot of reasons to feel positive about loan growth in the near term, but let me move on to the rest of our results. During the first quarter, we crossed a 14 billion threshold for period-end assets. We increased our average interest earning assets by adding 715 million of investment securities, an increase of 22%. These increases were fueled by average deposit growth of $1.1 billion or 11% during the quarter.", "Since the first quarter of 2009, average deposits have grown by more than 38% and we have increased our average investment securities portfolio by $2.5 billion. We are committed to putting as many of these resources to work as the sensible in the light of the changing economic and regulatory environment.", "Our strategy is to make investments that benefit income without compromising liquidity while positioning our balance sheet for rising rate environment.", "Net interest income remained stable in the first quarter at $101.4 million compared to $102.7 million in the fourth quarter despite the fact that average loans declined and there were only 90 days in the quarter versus 92 in the fourth quarter. Compared to the first quarter of 2009, net interest income rose 10% despite a $1 billion decrease in average loan balances during the same period.", "Loan yields were flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although they were higher than the first quarter 2009. Lower loans and continued deposit in flows contributed to a lower net interest margin of 3.3% compared to 3.5%, excuse me, 3.57% in the fourth quarter. Despite the impact of the deposit in flows on our net interest margin, our investment of these funds is accretive to net interest income.", "Moving on to credit quality, which continues to improve each quarter. Net charge-offs were $14.9 million in the first quarter driven by lower gross charge-offs as well as higher recoveries. This compares to net charge-offs of $31.6 million in the fourth quarter and $40.9 million in the first quarter of 2009.", "Our classified loan balances also declined for a third consecutive quarter. As a result of our improving credit picture and lower loan balances, our allowance for loan losses declined to 68.3 million or 1.61% of total gross loans compared to $72.5 million or 1.58% in the fourth quarter.", "Our loan loss provision declined in the first quarter to $10.7 million compared to $17.3 million in the fourth quarter primarily due to lower loan balances and lower net charge-offs. Once loan growth resumes, the provision will most likely increase even if credit quality continues to improve.", "Overall, our continually improving credit quality reflects our emphasis on strong portfolio management as well as the improving business environment for our clients. The improving business environment also had an impact on non-interest income, which rose $8.6 million or 21% during the quarter to $49.3 million, compared to $40.7 million in the fourth quarter.", "This increase was driven primarily by net gains of $16 million or $3.2 million net of non-controlling interest on investment securities related to our venture capital and private equity related investments. This compares to net gains of $6.7 million in the fourth quarter or 828,000 net of non-controlling interests.", "Although our outlook for core non-interest income has not changed, I want to share some thoughts on foreign exchange and client investment fees. Foreign exchange fees rose slightly by $700,000 during the quarter owing to the improving economy and cross-border private equity activity.", "We expect that trend to improve in coming quarters owing to improvements in the overall economy and renewed activity among our venture capital and private equity clients. Client investment fees were lower driven by lower client investment fund balances. We expect these fees will be somewhat lower in 2010 due to lower average client fund balances.", "While the FDIC has decided to extend unlimited insurance for demand deposits, we expect to opt out of that insurance at this point owing to our strong capital and liquidity. As a result, we could see increasing period in client investment fund balances towards the second half of the year. Our outlook for 2010 includes our expectation to opt out of the FDIC extended plan.", "Now I'd like to turn to non-interest expense, which as we expected increased by $10.7 million in the first quarter to $98.6 million, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits.", "As we have said in prior calls, this increase reflects a return to targeted compensation levels following two years in which incentive compensation was at half of target levels. Further employees received no merit increases and SVB made no contributions to its employee stock ownership program in 2009. That is because despite being profitable in 2009, we did not meet our internal targets due to the continuing decline of the economy.", "Going into 2010, one area of focus is to compensate our employees appropriately to reward their excellent work in the face of significant economic headwinds and to promote retention. This focus reflects an improving economic environment and the need to support our success in winning and retaining clients.", "Our employees did an outstanding job of driving our growth prior to the recession. We intend to take the appropriate steps to insure we can resume that growth in the near future.", "If we don't meet our performance goals, compensation expenses will likely trend lower, but if we do meet those goals, you will see the impact of merit increases, higher incentive compensation and some additional new senior staff who we expect will facilitate our future growth. Our view extends beyond the next quarter as we are developing and building our business for the long-term.", "Now, I'd like to talk about our updated outlook for the full year 2010, specifically the items that have changed. In general, we are still assuming a gradual economic recovery with technology being a bright spot, improving IPO and M&A markets and somewhat increased VC investment.", "We do not expect interest rates to rise until very late in the year. December is what the forward curve currently forecasts. As a result, we are unlikely to see a significant impact from higher interest rates in 2010.", "Coming out of the first quarter, we have reduced our expectations for loan growth, net interest income and net interest margin somewhat. By the same token we have improved our outlook for expenses, deposits, gains and losses from VC related investments and equity warrant income. These changes haven't materially changed our overall expectations for the year.", "For 2010, we expect that average loans will decrease at a percentage rate in the high single digits due to continued deleveraging by our clients in all industries and a somewhat slower return to quarterly loan growth than we expected.", "Previously, we had said expected loans, sorry, previously, we expected loans to remain comparable to 2009 levels. Our revised outlook implies modest end of period growth toward the second half of the year of about 4%. The improving economy will be a key driver for this number.", "We expect average deposits to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens due to our clients desire to maintain liquidity and the current low interest rate environment. We increased this outlook from the low double digits.", "We expect net interest income to increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits. This outlook also decreased from the mid-teens due to continued client deleveraging. We have reduced our outlook on net interest margin owing to our high deposit outlook and our adjusted loan outlook. We now expect net interest margin of between 3.5% and 3.8%.", "We have improved our outlook for net gains and losses on equity warrant assets. We now expect performance to improve slightly over 2009 levels due to upward market and valuation trends. Previously, we have said we expected no change from 2009.", "We also improved our outlook for net gains and losses on investments related to private equity and venture capital. We now expect them to improve over 2009 levels owing to improving market trends. In 2009, we had a loss on these investments net of non-controlling interest of $4.6 million. Previously we said we expected no change from 2009.", "Finally, we have slightly improved our expense outlook for 2010. We now expect expenses to increase a percentage rate in the high teens. We previously said expenses would increase at a rate in the high teens to low 20s. This change is related to a change in the timing of certain business initiatives and hiring plans.", "I would like to close by saying that although no one knows exactly how the recovery will play out; it seems to be taking hold. The VCX end markets are showing signs of life. Technology markets seem to be coming back strongly. Our clients are doing better and feeling better, and our pipeline is extremely strong.", "We have ample capital and liquidity and we expect that the improvements we have seen in the last quarter will enable us to continue capitalizing on opportunities for future growth.", "Thank you. And now, I'll ask the operator to open the call for Q&A. Operator?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Dave Rochester from FBR Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I know you mentioned loan growth of 4% in the back half of the year but given the increasing optimism we're hearing from you and the strong growth in the pipeline. Is it safe to say that you really expect to report loan growth next quarter?", "Greg Becker", "Dave, this is Greg Becker. And, I think from the loan growth perspective, what we try to do is give guidance that is more towards annual guidance and what we try to do is provide more clarity on what it's going to look like from towards the end of the year.", "As you know our guidance, we don't give out quarterly guidance or guidelines, so we're trying to give some more information but not move away from our guidance of more annual numbers.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Got it. Okay. And how do you envision this playing out, when your clients decide to expand and spend. Do you generally expect them to perhaps cap their cash that first before drawing down on lines of credit or do you generally expect them to tap the lines first and hold off on spending the cash they've been saving in the near-term?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Dave. This is Greg again. So it is incredibly company dependent on answering that question. You'll see with some public companies, they may want to preserve a fair amount of cash and they would borrow, even though they do have ample cash depending upon their situation.", "But clearly with most, what I'd say private companies, they are more geared toward working capital perspective to use cash first with the only exception being if they were doing equipment financing or something like that. So it is company dependent. But we don't expect to see any different trends than we have seen from historical periods.", "Dave Jones", "And this is Dave Jones. Let me just add and reinforce what Greg is saying that we are, we have been over recent weeks and months seeing folks put together the credit facility that maybe used for a small acquisition, maybe used for expanded working capital. And in the end, we might expect that they will both draw down on the credit facility and still maintain some pretty robust cash balances. That would be our historic norm.", "Ken Wilcox", "This is Ken. Let me just add one additional thing to think about and that is a lot of the companies and that we work with base their borrowing levels on business activity levels. Another way of putting it is if their credit facilities are geared towards their receivable levels and if their sales are not increasing then all other factors being equal, their receivables would also not be increasing and therefore the amount that they could borrow and the amount that they would probably borrow would not be increasing.", "But right now, we're beginning to see revenues increase that is the revenues of our portfolio companies are beginning to rise. That means our average receivables are higher. Their borrowing potential is higher and all other factors being equal, they are likely to be borrowing in order to support the growth in the receivables.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "That's great color. Thanks guys. Just one last one real quick on your international efforts you'd mentioned greater contributions from those. Can you just provide a little bit more color there as to what you're seeing?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Dave. This is Greg again. So from an international perspective, it's still relatively speaking small absolute numbers but it's more the incremental contribution, so we finished the first quarter with roughly $120, $125 million of loans from our kind of what we call our global international activities.", "And, when we look at the pipeline and growth outlook for that, from a growth perspective, we could see growth of 70% on that, so hitting $200, $225 by the end of the year. So very good about that, very good quality companies and we're really just getting that ramped up right now.", "Dave Rochester \u2013 FBR Capital Markets", "Okay. Great. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thanks. And just a quick question on the portfolio acquisitions that you mentioned. Just to be clear on that. I think you said, you've looked at a few acquisitions and you've planned to continue looking at those. The ones that you've looked at have actually been sold and you didn't win or are these portfolios that you're still looking at that the process is just ongoing?", "Ken Wilcox", "Let me start out, I think both Greg and I would like to contribute to the answer here. This is Ken. They would really fit into about three different categories, I think. There are a lot of stuff out there and a lot of it is priced in a way that just doesn't make sense from our perspective.", "So you could say that there are probably some things that we may still be looking at. You could probably say that there are some things that we weren't interested and may still be there and you could say there could be some things potentially although I'm not 100% sure; this is true that have actually gone to somebody who was willing to pay more.", "Greg Becker", "And only thing I would add, Ken, is that on the portfolio side. We've looked at this stuff and some of the stuff is in various stages of moving forward with other players and we'll see what happens, so we are definitely, Ken's main message is that, we have been looking and we're going to continue to look.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. Great. And Ken, maybe just another follow-up on the loan growth question before, you see \u2013 I guess in your prepared comments, it just seems so optimistic in talking about all of the reasons why loan growth is picking up and the outlook is so bright.", "But then the guidance is not that bright, it just seems that there's a disconnect to some extent between what you see happening versus what you say could happen. Are you just \u2013 are you intentionally being somewhat conservative in your guidance there?", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah. Well I think, we are, first of all, I'm the CEO and Mike is the CFO, and the other thing I'd say is that, we both have a good reason for looking at things the way we do. I think that I'm basing my views which are optimistic. There can be no doubt about it, on the fact that we're seeing the revenues of the companies and the portfolio pick up, and we're also seeing a much stronger pipeline.", "We were as good as anybody if not better at pipeline analysis and the pipeline is beyond the shadow of a doubt much stronger than it was a quarter ago and so all the other factors being equal that it would be shocking to me, if that didn't translate into loan growth, having said that you can't say with absolute certainty that it will.", "Greg Becker", "The only think I would add is I would actually say that there's two ways to look at it. One is average and clear the guidance is down on average basis. And it's name Greg. The only thing I would add-on to it is I would actually say that there's two ways to look at it. One is average and clearly the guidance is down on the average basis, and it's mainly because of the continued decline we did have in the First Quarter but the additional color we tried to provide was taking period end, the end of 2009 compared to the period end of 2010 and that's a 4% growth is what we had just stated in the revised guidance. That's going to give you a lot more color and if you look at that period end at 4% growth compared to where we are today, it is actually pretty robust growth from here to the end of the period.", "Ken Zerbe \u2013 Morgan Stanley", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Hi, everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Good afternoon.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Could we start, could you give a little more color what's driving the deposit growth here particularly the non-interest bearing? Is it just a case that your customer sales are up and they just have more cash to hold?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I'll start and others may want to add. So there's a couple things to look at. One is just the overall total client funds and if you look towards the middle of last year, we kind of reached another low point, 24-25 billion. We've been growing nicely since then and at a pretty steady path since that time period. So one is just both the new companies we're adding, liquidity in the market which is increasing is helping to contribute to overall total client funds. So that's the first thing. Second thing what you said I believe is true which is as sales pick up, as activity levels pick up, more cash flowing to transactional business comes into their checking account or their DDA balance and because there really isn't a alternative that's going to get a decent yield. It's just easier to keep it in your transactional or your DDA account. And so that is the main reason why you've seen a growth in DDA, but I'd look at both things that happening, improving economy and overall total client funds picking up.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "To follow-up on the portfolio acquisition questions, can you give us a sense as to the size of the portfolios you've actually done, due diligence on and who are the sellers here? Are these other banks that are selling these portfolios?", "Greg Becker", "We really can't comment on that kind of thing and I think you can understand why.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay. We'll follow-up off line. Just one for Mike.", "Mike Descheneaux", "I won't talk offline.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Okay, can you give \u2013", "Mike Descheneaux", "Nor will Mike. Okay, go ahead with your question, sorry, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "That's okay. I'm looking at the expense guidance which changed just from the Investor Day. We spent a lot of time that day talking about why everybody was too low on their expense expectations. Could you give a little more color on what's changed since then now that you're taking the guidance down?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So we're taking it down slightly as I alluded in my prepared comments there and again, part of our expense outlook in growth was related to investing in certain project, be it systems projects or a global expansion as well as even hiring additional people to help us with our growth going forward. So when we're sitting here trying to continue with the project as well as the hiring there sometimes becomes a little bit more challenging to hire people. So for example, when we may have expected to hire something in Q1 and perhaps that's not happening and maybe sliding into Q2 or Q3, so again, I wouldn't, it's a slight adjustment but nonetheless it is an adjustment from an improved outlook.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 J.P. Morgan", "Got you. Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Christopher Nolan from Maxim Group. Your line is open.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "Good afternoon guys.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "A quick question, Mike. On the securities gains, those appear to be mostly from SVB Capital, is that correct?", "Mike Descheneaux", "It's between our investment and managed fund to funds as well as some of our sponsored debt funds as well.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "And I guess a key question here is has these funds entered any investment harvest phase which was spoken about a couple years ago where once they start reaching a certain maturity in terms of time, the harvest in terms of carry and so forth started coming on a more regular basis. So we should start seeing these security gains from this unit be a more regular occurrence?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So what happened in Q1 was more some of the valuation metrics improved. You had some better valuation comps. Now, as far as into that harvesting we're hopeful that that is going to begin to start to happen. We should start to hopefully expect to see some exits and actual distributions from those portfolios. So yeah, you could say that we are looking out to seeing those this year.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "Sorry, Chris, we actually have Mark here.", "Mark MacLennan", "As Mike said, it's our expectation or at least we hope to see continued modest recovery in the whole M & A and IPO market and that's really where the distributions will come from so certainly far more optimistic in 2010 than we have the last 15 months on that level of activity.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hi, good afternoon everyone.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hello, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "A question with respect to the liquidity that continues to build and the securities that you've been purchasing. Can you give some additional detail on the securities and in particular, kind of where things are in terms of fixed versus floating? You suggested that you're preparing the balance sheet for rising rates but I imagine that's got to be tough with big securities book.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah. And that's right. I mean as you know historically we've only bought fixed income instruments. And so in those events typically two and a half to three and a half years or so in duration, so as we enter into Q2 we're beginning to purchase variable rates agency CMOs as well too which have a slightly lower duration, perhaps one to two years in duration, so when rates do pick up that portfolio will benefit so essentially one way you could look at it is we're moving some of our cash that's only earning 25 basis points into some of these variable rate securities. So that's kind of what we've been doing.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "And have you done models to see, I'm sure you have but I'm just curious what or how are you managing that so that you aren't put into a bad valuation position on that book if we do start seeing rates hike towards end of this year or early next year?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Valuation perspective from what's the concern?", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Well, if rates start rising and the value of the securities book starts falling, what are you doing to prevent that kind of scenario?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Again, by us taking down the duration what's going to be helpful is adding these variable rate securities. So if we continue to pile on that and if rates started going up you'd have that so-called unrealized loss position as the rates rise. So part of the investment going into the variable rate securities is to try to help alleviate them.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "What are the cash flows currently coming out of the portfolio?", "Mike Descheneaux", "I don't have that off the top of my head, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay. Thank you.", "Ken Wilcox", "And before we go on to the next question, this is Ken; I would just like to interject something. I'd like to go back to the earlier discussion that we were having around portfolio acquisition and add one final point that I hope will be helpful in terms of understanding what we're trying to accomplish. And that is that the reason that I mentioned it may not have been the reason that some of you were inferring and I apologize for that. I just want to underscore that we're very pleased that our balance sheet is such that we're in a position now to look at anything that's out there. And to make an evaluation and if we were to come to the conclusion that it was being offered at a sensible price or that we could acquire it for a sensible price, we're in a position to take advantage of those kinds of opportunities and they are out there.", "There could be no doubt about it. For a whole host of different reasons, they are out there. Having said that though, first of all we aren't going to overpay if we can possibly help it and we probably are in a pretty good position to evaluate most of these portfolios because we know most of the companies that are in them. And the other thing I wanted to say though is that we are still focused first and foremost on organic growth. That has virtually always been our approach and continues to be our approach and we expect that most of the good things that you'll see in the coming years will emanate from organic growth, not from portfolio acquisition. This just happens to be an unusual point in the business cycle where there are probably obvious reasons a number of portfolios out there that are either in the market for sale might be soon.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Operator, can we have the next question?", "Operator", "Certainly, your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from the Banc of America. Your line is open.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Banc of America", "Thanks, good afternoon. My question is about the net interest margin, so just understanding you have all of this excess liquidity on the deposit side and the margin came down to 330. I'm just wondering as far as getting back to the 353.85 for the full year that implies a very steep ramp for the rest of the year, so I'm wondering if you can just help us differentiate between what's your expectation of rate hikes like how many and when and versus how much of that benefit would come through the improvement kind of on the loan side, the rate versus volume question.", "Greg Becker", "Let me just start with the rate outlook. As far as the rate outlook, look, in this year, we aren't expecting any significant upside at all. If you look at the forward curve, it's just not going to add anything to this year here. And again, our margin is basically strictly down because of those large volumes of deposits so if you were to take out some of the deposits you'd still be within the guidance on the net interest margin. As far as the loans, certainly loans, when our loan yields are somewhere in the neighborhood of a little bit north of 7%. If you start bringing those loans on it has a very powerful effect to help us get back to the net NIM range.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Banc of America", "And so basically you can comfortably get inside even the bottom half of that range without if the Fed doesn't move?", "Greg Becker", "That's right. So when we did do our forecast. We basically are looking at the forward curve so the forward curve is roughly around a rate hike in December. But as you know, first 25 basis points is not going to be overly helpful on loans. But again, it would only be like one month for the year. So it's not going to have a major impact on the NIM.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. So then you're basically going to exiting the year on NIM a lot higher than \u2013 even to get to the bottom end to 350 you're going to have to be exiting the year at a much higher NIM than you are at right? That's just the math of it?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah. I'm sure that's how it works mathematically. Again, for the year our guidance is 3.5 to 3.8 range.", "Ken Usdin \u2013 Banc of America", "Okay. Great. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Fred Cannon from KBW. Your line is open.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Thanks. Just this may be repetitive. Mike, so the position is very large cash position $4.5 billion of cash, maybe just a little more on your current strategy. It looks like your hesitant to invest it because of giving up rate sensitivity and you want to remain liquid for opportunities for both organic growth and portfolio purchases. Is that the best way to think about it?", "Mike Descheneaux", "You're right, Fred. Those are certainly some of the aspects. The other aspect is we've talked about opting out of this FDIC insurance program. And we've been talking for some time now that look, we could have some movement in $1.5 to $2 billion possibly a bit more in our deposits is well too. So when I'm thinking about it looking out or we all think about it we do bear that in mind and say look what happens if that does move to interest bearing or to our off balance sheet funds as well.", "So that's part of the playing out and again like you correctly said you don't want to go too long in duration. And the yields out there are just not overly impressive and so that's why we're just being very sensible not to get caught up too much on duration.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "I guess from a capital liquidity standpoint, maybe general question. Do you guys want the balance sheet to be bigger than $14 billion or do you feel like this is kind of as big as you'd like it to be strategically or do you follow what deposits come in?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Fred, as long as we can still be accretive and it's not a drag on return equity yeah, I think it definitely makes sense to keep the deposits on balance sheet. Because either perhaps in the short-term we aren't able to put it to work but again if you take our long-term view and the things we're trying to do with some of our larger corporate clients.", "And we are going to need those deposits long-term down the road. And so the last thing is you want to deposit to leave your bank and then you try to struggle to go get it back. So our view is you know what, let's keep those deposits on our balance sheet as long as we can put it to work effectively.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hey, Fred. I'd like to add one thing to that, because I really don't want you to walk away with a wrong impression. We are fixated on optimizing the value of the balance sheet. This isn't about balance sheet size or anything of that sort. This is about optimizing the value of the balance sheet. And I wouldn't \u2013 I also don't believe that it would be fair to characterize our behavior as simply going with the flow of the deposits. We also in our effort to optimize value of the balance sheet do everything that we reasonably can to influence the direction of the flow of deposits.", "Having said that, I think you are probably coming from your observation that there's an awful lot of capital and an awful lot of liquidity on this balance sheet and hard to disagree with you on that. But I think you are also going to keep in mind that we're coming out of a pretty deep recession and although things appear to be getting better. I don't think any reasonable person can claim that they can predict the future with absolute certainty. So I think prudent bankers right now have stronger balance sheets, not in terms of size but in terms of strength.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Which may be a tad less efficient than you ideally like. Is that a point?", "Ken Wilcox", "Well, yeah. We would hope to be more efficient and it's our intention to be more efficient. Because again our goal is to optimize or maximize the value of the balance sheet and so I completely understand what you're driving at and I am incomplete agreement with you. If your view is that we could have a more efficient balance sheet and should target that and we will indeed. But I think there's a time and a place and at this point in the business cycle, I'm comfortable that we're doing the right thing for our shareholders.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Okay. And then just one more, in terms of the expenses, you did say that basically the growth in expenses is related to achieving internal targets in your performance goals. And I guess it would appear that given the expenses that we saw this quarter that you are hitting your current performance goals. I was wondering, Ken, if you could give us any insight into what those kind of the performance goals you're looking at are to continue to keep that expenses in line with your guidance?", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah. I'm going to leave specific numbers up to Mike. But I will tell you that we are doing a pretty good job although I would not, I do not believe that we are knocking the cover off the ball just yet. Having said that, I can assure you that that is everybody is intention here at SVB. I think there are at least 1200 people here who are maybe its 1200 and change, who are intent on knocking the cover off the ball and every one of them intends to earn their variable compensation to the fullest extent in the course of the year.", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "Thanks, Ken.", "Ken Wilcox", "Do you have a further comment on that or is that good enough?", "Fred Cannon \u2013 KBW", "I think that's fair. Okay. Thanks.", "Ken Wilcox", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht from JMP Securities. Your line is open.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one question actually that hasn't been answered at this point and it's related, intends to model the poor get a sense for the relationship between the equity gains and the composition of the minority interest. You had a $16 million net gains and a $10 million minority interest expense this quarter. I mean is given the composition of your investments and your outlook for gains going forward, is that relationship a fair one that we should think about going forward or is there some volatility there we should be accounting for?", "Mark MacLennan", "John, this is Mark MacLennan. I think the portions are still rough proportions. Our investment depending on whether it's a fund investment or possibly a strategic investment can range from a 5% investment to in some cases we've had deal north of 15%. So on a quarterly basis, it will vary depending upon where the returns come from in that minority interest to the gross level of gains, but I think if you look at what happened this past quarter because it was a good mixture of results coming from both SVB Capital as well as our strategic investment. That's probably about as good a ratio as I can give you.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "And then given than the pipeline of maybe IPSs within your portfolios and things of that nature. Is this a spike or is this a fair number to think about on a quarterly basis or is this just going to be so volatile that it's not even worth forecasting at that level?", "Mark MacLennan", "By I'd love to have you give me the answer to that one.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "Okay.", "Mark MacLennan", "It's an extraordinarily tough number to figure out. I would say moderate improvement certainly in the first quarter than what we saw, the numbers that, Ken, gave you in his introductory comments. So I'm more optimistic than I've been in a long-time about the M&A and a resurgence of the IPO market. But that can come and go at any point in time. So it's hard to, I believe it will continue, I believe it will be a full continuation which on average will certainly benefit us to the positive.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "Great. Thank you for the color. Thanks very much.", "Mike Descheneaux", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions) Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hi, Joe.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Circling back again on this portfolio acquisition, I was just curious for the ones being marketed are they any particular part of the lifecycle or industry niche and as you think about that opportunity where would be your greatest interest?", "Ken Wilcox", "Well, we work with companies everywhere from pre-venture capital Roth [ph] start up to I think the largest companies in the portfolio are in the $1 billion in sales range. So that's quite a range and I don't know, personally of any portfolios that include companies that are in the hundreds of millions of dollars in sales range.", "So that would leave us with earlier stage and growth stage companies and our interest would be anywhere where that the companies themselves fit into our target market. In other words, there are portfolios of things out there that we would have absolutely no interest in whatsoever because we are intending to stick to what we do, which is we work as you know, with venture backed companies in the innovation space and then our companies that were venture backed and have now out grown venture capital support.", "So it's anything in our target market on the opportunities would be earlier stage and growth stage and in addition to that, I'm underscoring here, we are not as \u2013 I would say our opinion of the value of some of the things that we've looked at is not as high as the opinion of the sellers.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Right. Okay. I guess secondly not to let Dave feel left out, non-performing assets were being flat.", "Ken Wilcox", "He looks much happier?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Were there any kind of major inflows or outflows or anything of note in some of the credit trends? It sounds like the overall pool of potential problems continues to kind of with sometime.", "Ken Wilcox", "Yes. And thank you, Joe. So our performance in the first quarter was as we would expect. And we continue to see some issues stemming from the early stage portfolio, but as you can see by the numbers, that is declining. Obviously, there wasn't anything large in the first quarter experience. So that also is a very positive and contributes to the information that Mike shared in our forecast for the balance of the year.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'd now turn the call back over to the presenters.", "Ken Wilcox", "All right. Well, let me just wind up by reiterating my optimism and it's based not just on everything I see and hear out there in the market, but it's based on what we're seeing in our pipeline. And we're feeling good about the accomplishments this quarter. Again, we didn't knock the cover off the ball but we did pretty well and we intend to knock the cover off the ball in the coming quarter. So that's I think the best summary I can possibly give. Thank you all for being part of the call today. We hope it was helpful. Have a good day.", "Operator", "This concludes today\u2019s conference.

My name is Mason and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group Q2 2010 earnings call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Ms. Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. You may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you operator and thank you all for joining us. We welcome you to our second quarter 2010 earnings call. I would like to remind everyone that our second quarter earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com. I would also like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may different materially. We refer you to our reports filed with the SEC and ask you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release filling with forward-looking information.", "This disclaimer applies equally to the statements made in this call. We will limit the length of the call to one hour which will include Q&A. During the Q&A section, we ask you to limit your question to one primary and one follow-up before getting back in the queue to enable other participants ask their questions.", "And with that I will turn the call over Ken Wilcox. President and CEO.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you Meghan and thank you all for joining us. I'm pleased to report that we earned $21.1 million in the second quarter or $0.50 per share. We're proud of those numbers and encouraged by the fact that our performance in the second quarter was characterized by loan growth, high credit quality and increased net interest income. It appears that the positive momentums when we talked about in April is beginning to generate results.", "First, there is growing evidence that despite the struggling economy our clients are moving now to pursue opportunities for growth. Period-end loans grew by $245 million, a 5.8% increase over last quarter. This was the first loan growth we've seen in six quarters and it was driven in large part by loans to our life sciences venture capital and private equity clients.", "Activity in our pipeline also remains strong in the second quarter. An indication that this healthy demand maybe the beginning of a trend. Second, if our positive credit quality is any indicator, our clients are entering the recovery in a position of relative strength. Our net charge-offs dropped by 70% in the second quarter to less than $4 million. In addition, we saw a 15% decline in classified loans during the quarter and 38% decline from their peak one year ago.", "While we have our underwriting expertise to think for the high quality of our loan book, we also believe the inherent resilience of our client base is a major factor. Third, our clients remains highly liquid. They added nearly $1.6 billion in total client funds during the quarter, one billion of which went to the balance sheet. These deposits allowed us to increase our average interest earning investment securities portfolio by another 30% to $5.2 billion. We have more than doubled our investment securities portfolio in the last year as a result of this solid deposit growth and our efforts have driven our net interest income to an all time high.", "We are feeling encouraged by the resilience of our client base and by our solid loan momentum and good credit quality. In addition our capital and liquidity remained very strong, even after completing the repurchase of the warrant issued to the US treasury as part of our participation in the capital purchase program.", "Overall SVB is well positioned to take advantage of the improvements we're seeing around us. The primary challenge we have right now is the slow pace of the broader economic recovery. While we believe we have the resources to operate effectively throughout this recovery period, we expect to realize our most significant growth potential only when the economy shows sustainable improvement and interest rates began to rise.", "This recovery maybe complicated to some extent by the recent passage of the financial services reform bill. There are many questions still to be addressed by the regulators before we can say with any certainty what impact the new regulations will have on us. But I want to comment on two provisions of the bill that are of particular interest. First is the so called Volcker Rule, which puts limits on banks investments in hedge funds and private equity funds.", "Clearly, this will have an impact on our funds management business SVB Capital, but it is too early to say exactly what that impact will be. We built SVB Capital as a way of delivering value to our clients and shareholders by providing clients with access to investments. They would otherwise be unable to access on their own. We do not believe the Volcker Rule is intended to restrict this kind of investment but ultimately the regulators will decided whether venture capital falls under the same umbrella as hedge funds and large private equity funds.", "If the answer is yes, we could be required to reduce our investments overtime. Fortunately, the law would appear to provide ample time for exiting your liquid investments anywhere from four to nine years. That amount of run way would give us more flexibility to make the best decisions for shareholders in determining our next steps with SVB Capital.", "Regardless of the outcome, regarding limits on venture capital investments, we do not expect that Volcker Rule to impact our core banking business in any significant way whatsoever. The second provision of the financial reform bill, particularly interest is the repeal of the regulation prohibiting banks from paying interest on business checking account. Again it is too soon to say exactly how this will affect SVB or any bank since all banks will be affected.", "The provision will not be implemented for another year and its impact would depend on a variety of factors including market interest rates over time, client preferences, earnings credit rate policies and task considerations. From our perspective it becomes another consideration and striking a balance between our client's objectives and our own.", "Despite the challenges ahead for the industry and the economy at large, we are feeling positive. The technology industry appears to be recovering ahead of the rest of the economy just as we expected. The second quarter brought another round of strong earnings reports from technology leaders such as Intel and IBM, who are seeing higher demand and increased opportunity. Such momentum among these larger companies is generally a positive sign for the broader technology industry.", "Venture capital reports in the second quarter are positive as well. VC has invested $6.5 billion and 906 deals during the quarter, a 34% increase in dollars and 22% increase in the number of deals compared to the first quarter. Venture capital dollars invested year-to-date have increased by almost 50% over last year.", "Exits for venture backed companies were also strong. Venture backed IPO volumes spiked to its highest quarterly level since 2007 with 17 offerings. The year is looking strong as well. There have been more IPOs in 2010 to-date than in all of 2008 and 2009 combined. There were fewer merger in the acquisitions of venture backed companies in the second quarter than in the first quarter, 92 compared to 119 but still a very strong number.", "Still one of the strongest quarters we've seen in the past four years. We remain hopeful that his activity will tell a sustainable recovery in the technology markets overall. In the meantime, the opportunities for our clients are growing and that creates opportunities for us. Thanks to the hard work of our outstanding employees, we continue to see robust activity in our pipeline and solid credit quality.", "We remain one of the best capitalized banks in the industry and are well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities as they emerge. We continue to work hard to build momentum throughout the recovery that will provide significant earnings potential as the economy improves.", "Thank you and now I will turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thanks Ken and thank you all for joining us today. We are pleased to have delivered a strong second quarter marked by continued momentum in our core business and signs of improving business conditions for our clients. There are five highlights I think are worth mentioning at the offset. First is loan momentum. We are pleased that period-end loans grew by $245 million and average loan balances held steady after six quarters of decline.", "Second, credit quality continued to improve as it has for the last five quarter, which is a great feeling. This improvement was led by lower net charge-offs. Third, we recorded our highest level of net interest income ever, $106.4 million, thanks to our investment portfolio which is being funded by our growing deposits. Fourth and finally, our non-GAAP non-interest income net off non-controlling interest rose by 5% to $37.2 million thanks to higher credit invest sorry, thanks to higher client investment fund balances.", "Total clients investment fund balances increased overall. In aggregate, end of period deposits and off balance sheet funds increased by $1.6 billion or 6% during the second quarter to $28.1 billion, the second highest period-end balance in our history. Let's move into some details starting with loans. Average loan balances held steady at $4.1 billion, but we're trending up towards the end of Q2.", "These improvements are a result of improvements in our clients markets as well as our success at winning their business. Our pipeline also remains stronger in the quarter which suggest that we may have reversed the trend of the last six quarter with a return to loan growth. We believe that the positive outlook for technology spending in the coming year will ultimately lead to higher utilization rates and increased commitments.", "The environment continues to be very competitive but our ability to differentiate ourselves to win deals without sacrificing credit quality seems to be paying off. With respect to credit quality, we saw a continued positive trends in the second quarter. Our loans \u2013 allowance for loan losses remained flat at 1.6% which reflects loan growth and changes in the composition of our portfolio.", "Even after provisioning for loan growth our loan provision decreased by $3.3 million to $7.4 million in the second quarter. That reduction was driven by improvements in our early stage portfolio which resulted in lower net charge-offs of $3.9 million compared to $14.9 million in the first quarter. This number reflects gross charge-offs of $7.1 million versus $21.2 million in the first quarter.", "Impaired loan balances were flat at $50.9 million compared to $50.6 million in the first quarter. I am pleased to say that subsequent to the close of the quarter, we received payments totaling $5.8 million related to loans included in the impaired balance. As a result, we are entering Q3 on strong footing. Our overall credit trends reflect a high quality of our portfolio, our continued emphasis on strong portfolio management and what appears to be an improving business environment for our clients.", "Moving on to the income statement. The headline is simply higher net interest income despite a lower net interest margin. Net interest income increased by 5% or $5.6 million in the second quarter to $106.4 million, its highest level in our history. This increase stand primarily from the significant growth of our average investment securities during the quarter from $4 billion to $5.2 billion, reflecting new investments in agency backed mortgage securities. Strong deposit inflows fueled our investment securities growth. Average deposits grew by almost a $1 billion to $11.9 billion in the second quarter.", "This growth in the low interest rate environment impacted our net interest margin which was 3.20% in Q2 compared to 3.30% in the first quarter. And has also changed our 2010 outlook. Turning to non-interest income. Non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest increased in the second quarter to $37.2 million, a 5% increase over $35.4 million in the first quarter. As a remainder these are non-GAAP numbers. This increase was driven primarily by client investment piece as a result of higher client investment fund balances.", "Average client investment funds increased by $435 million in the second quarter, to $15.5 billion. Owing to higher period-end balances in our SVB asset management business which grew by $1 billion. Income from our other core fee business lines which include deposit service charges, client investment fees, credit card fees and the letters of credit was higher in aggregate as a result of improving business conditions for our clients.", "However fees on foreign exchange were down by $606 million, sorry, $606,000 although still at a nice lever, owing to lower national volumes especially in light of the exceptionally strong FX income we had in Q1. Gains in our investment securities portfolio net of non controlling interest were lower during the quarter, adding $1.2 million to our bottom line versus $3.2 million in the first quarter. Again those are non-GAAP numbers.", "Net gains for the quarter primarily reflect the sale of all non agency mortgage securities held in our fixed income portfolio. I want to say a few words about total client funds before I move on. I mentioned earlier that we saw a significant increased in both deposits and off balance sheet client funds during the quarter. Average deposits grew by 8.6% to $11.9 billion during the quarter, while average client investment funds grew by nearly 3% to $15.5 billion.", "We also reached a milestone in our SVB Asset Management business where we actively manage client funds. They exceeded period-end balances as $7 billion an all time high in early July. As I said we see this positive trend in total client funds as evidence that our clients liquidity is increasing driven by improving economic conditions particularly for technology industries.", "Additionally it is a sign that we are engaging clients in the market and showing them what makes SVB different from other banks. Now we'll move onto our updated outlook for the full-year 2010. Let me start with a two areas that have changed, deposit growth and net interest margin. For 2010, we expect that average deposits will increase at a percentage rate in the high 20s. We raised our outlook for average deposits due to our clients focus on maintaining liquidity and the lack of compelling yields available in the current low rate interest rate environment.", "We have said previously that we thought $1.5 billion to $2 billion deposits might move to off balance sheet funds, one we opted out of the FDIC's extended deposit insurance program. That opt out became effective June 30 and the deposit behavior we have seen since then suggests to us that lower interest rates are likely to influence our clients deposit behavior more than deposit insurance.", "As a result, we think the likely flow of deposits off the balance sheet over time assuming a low interest rate environment will be in the range of $1 billion to $1.5 billion. As a result of our higher expectations for average deposits and the low interest rate environment we have decreased the outlook for our net-interest margin to a range of 3.2% to 3.4%. We previously said we expected a net interest margin between 3.5% and 3.8%.", "As a result of the solid momentum on loan balances we saw towards the end of the second quarter, we continued to believe loan trends will improve in the second half of the year. We expect average loan balances to decrease at a percentage rate in the high single digits for the year which implies higher average quarterly balances in the coming quarters. Our pipeline remains strong and the strong loan growth we have seen in the last 45 days reinforces these expectations.", "We feel we are starting at a strong point going into the second half of the year. In general we expect business conditions for our clients to continue to improve albeit slowly, with demand for technology recovering and an improving venture environment, we expect increasing demand for loans and fee-based services as well as better results in our venture related investments.", "We expect credit quality to remain stable, assuming your gradual, economic recovery. Our clients are performing well on their credit commitments and the underlying trends in our portfolio are positive. I would like to close by saying that although the economic recovery appears to be a long-term proposition we are pleased with the momentum we have been seeing among our clients and the impact it is having on our business. We are encouraged by growth in our loan balances and the strong credit performance of our portfolio.", "Despite what you are hearing regarding the level of economic uncertainty these days, our clients and the industries they serve are demonstrating their resilience. They appear pious to outperform the industry overall in the years ahead. Their prospects have generated some new competition given the game outlook for many banks in their traditional industries. Nevertheless, we believe we have a compelling value proposition as well as the resources to remain competitive and adaptive. Thank you and now I will ask the operator to open it up for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). We'll pause for just a brief moment to compile the Q&A roster. Your first question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you, good afternoon everyone.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hi Joe.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hi Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess two questions, first related to the Volcker Rule maybe Mike could you just give us what the exact amount of VC and private equity investments that's subject to the role and is that number growing, are you continuing to make investments here in the near term or in a sense honoring calls and when do you expect to know more and about this and perhaps whether you'll be staying in the funds management business?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Let me Joe let me answer the first part of your question which is give you a rough ballpark of how much we have invested in the venture capital/ private equity world or (inaudible) investments related to that area and then (inaudible) little bit on the Volcker Rule and its impact for the rest of your questions.", "But if you go back to Q1 in general we have approximately $210, let's say $220 million of investments in the private equity in venture capital space. We'll come up with a little bit more updated number here with the queue when it come out, but it's a little bit higher than that but to too much to in general when we think about investments at risk that's about let's just say $220 million here for the moment.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay.", "Mike Descheneaux", "And then perhaps Ken will add, answer the second part of your question.", "", "Ken Wilcox", "So Joe, let me go to the second part and that's around when we will be making decisions concerning the ultimate, I suppose outcome which means when we be continued, will be continuing your invest or will we not be continuing to invest and if we're not continuing to invest what would be the doing with the investments that we've already made and the problem there is its really premature for to answer that question, I don't think there is a anybody on earth was in a position to answer that question right now and if they do answer for you, my name is there jumping the gun and they will have to change their answer to your question at some point in the next couple of year because it was just as you know signed in the law and the at we're going to grow and extensive period of time where law is somehow translated into regulation and that could at least a year and maybe two and who knows because sometimes that only take two years end up taking three or even four.", "So I think tits going to be a long time been coming, second it's still not very clear based on what's called the (inaudible) which are the accompanying letter that are written by individual, senators and others. Around what they really met when they boarded, it's still not really clear whether they were intending to have this include venture capital or not and in fact they are.", "There is ample evidence that the instigators weren't really intending to target venture capital to begin with. So we don't really know how that's going out and I would say there is not a person on earth how knows how we'll come out and one day we finally figured out I will almost guarantee at least a year or two would have gone by and potentially even more and once the final decisions are make the law provides several additional years for disposing of whatever assets are in your possession at the time. So ask me again, but wait a couple of years.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay and then my other question was on jus the loan growth from the quarter. If I look at your table kind of outlining larger loans over $20 million that balance was up call it $183 million of the quarter which is roughly 75% of the overall growth and loans this quarter. It sounds like this is primarily due to a couple of life science credits and can you talk a bit about the nature of those credits, I don't think they've necessary capital call lines but are they participations and does this I guess given that how are you really feeling about demand going forward and how sustainable it?", "Dave Jones", "And Joe this is Dave Jones, let me tough on that. So your review is accurate. The larger share of the growth from a niche perspective did come from life sciences. There were a couple of pretty significant transactions in there, neither one or participated and Joe, not to get into more detail than it would appropriate but I can assure you that the loan structure is as good as realistically could be for the size of credits, meaning that it is very solid source of repayment for the credits.", "Greg Becker", "Yes it's Greg Becker. This is kind of second part of your question which is one kind of loan growth and outlook we as Mike had said we had this loan growth towards the end of the quarter, mainly driven by a couple of large but as we've said in previous calls the pipeline has been building, it's nice to say this pickup at the end of other quarter but outlook is positive and the growth is from where we've talked about the four which is across our gross segment, corporate finance, global and utilization rates improving as well.", "And the combination of all those things is really what is composition of our pipeline and that what we derive our comfort from growth for the balance of the year.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's very helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from one of Steven Alexopoulos from JP Morgan. Your line is open.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "Hi everyone.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hi.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "If we could start I know you said your client base I proving more resilient to the slowdown in the economy, just curious if you can pair last quarter's call to this one, did you see any mark caution in terms of the outlook from your clients that could impact the closing rate of what's in the pipeline?", "Greg Becker", "Yes Steve, this is Greg Becker again. And I would say that there is kind of contradicting messages one, you listen to lot of feedback from the overall general economy and its very muted, very uncertain or still uncertain. The word is unusually and certain I think we're even used. From our standpoint when we talked to our clients, companies are still, they're spending money on technologies, their demand is \u2013 they're feeling good about the demand. So they're still somewhat concerned about the overall market outlook but they continued to be optimistic about the demands for their business and their products and services.", "So I would say my gage would be its slightly better than last quarter and which is slightly better in the quarter so that's what a continuation of the positive trend that we've seen.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, thanks. Maybe just one follow-up from Mike. How should we be thinking about the yield on the $5 billion of taxable securities going forward, there is 290 pretty close to a bottom here?", "Mike Descheneaux", "As far where we're trending where it's going to go.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "Well it's been trending down quite a bit each quarter for the last two quarters, just wondering if that 290s a reasonable run rate here, or does it keep going down because you're trimming duration in that book.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yes, I think if you could down a little bit some, we do have some of the investments securities that are maturing each quarter as well and obviously the reinvestment rate that's available out there, particularly considering when you think of it the treasury is right around 50 basis points or so. So yes there is the certainly pressure on that going forward a little bit.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "Do you have a bottom before you think a bottom is out approximately?", "Mike Descheneaux", "No again lot of it just depends on how we reinvested, I mean rates have been coming down quite a lot lately, I mean we're certainly trying to balance what's available out there in the rate with I'm trying to keep it very sensible duration but right now again its jus going to be driven by the rates here.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JP Morgan", "Okay, fair enough. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hey good afternoon guys.", "Ken Wilcox", "Hi Aaron.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Mike maybe just following up on Steven's question. Can you just maybe give a little bit more color on how you're managing duration risk and interest rate risk and the securities book, it's just I guess with it now being larger than the new loan book, it's a big piece of the balance sheet and seems like there is could be some growing risk there.", "Mike Descheneaux", "We're trying to manage to is making sure that we're investing sensibly and maintaining liquidity, I mean the one of the things you have to be conscious of is the fact of not going too far or getting too far on duration particularly with the fixed rate portfolio, and again unfortunately here right now in this rate environment the rates are so low. But again our first and primary objective is protecting the portfolio and just being sensible of obtaining some yield.", "So we're still targeting that kind of a two, 2.5 year duration. And as we probably point out at the end of last quarter, we did add bit over a $1 billion in some variable rate securities on LIBOR base with a relatively short duration say one to 1.5 year. So we're primarily going to keep that objective of maintaining strong liquidity. Because again there is just not a whole lot of yield after the chase to get any kind of yield you really need to go five, six, seven years to get anything decent so again primary objective is keeping strong liquidity.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Well with that I guess you also have more than $4 billion in cash on the balance sheet, what's the right number for that and are you still looking to deploy more of the cash.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yes, Aaron since we did opt out of the FDIC's insurance program. We are going to start to see some of that tail off towards end of the year. We are seeing it moving essentially from our balance sheet to our off balance sheet investment funds business or so we have started to see that already if they're onset of Q3. So you will certainly see those balances go down quite a fair amount here, as you know I updated here on the call, we expect anywhere from $1 billion to $1.5 billion probably to come off between now and the end of the year on those deposits and it would certainly come out of those cash balance levels.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht from JMP Securities.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "First question is more about the venture capital environment. You guys were discussing that deployment in Q2 increased from Q1. IPO activity was also part of solid VC environment. But if I read something actually recently, it suggested that the venture capital fundraising was down relatively significantly from early part of the year. I am just wondering what's your perspective on this and what do we make of this in terms of the consistency potential for a loan demand.", "Greg Becker", "Obviously we feel good about the growth in venture capital in the second quarter, maybe a follow-up to your question, is it sustainable at that level, I think the second quarter was a strong quarter. I can see by declining or flattening out for the balance of the year mainly based on what you said which is the fundraising that is taking place. It's hard to raise money out there and I think that's going to continue for a while. So although we feel good about the second quarter, again it's probably going to be slightly down to flat on a go-forward basis. The other point I would make is given that the M&A volume and the IPO volume the venture firms that we are talking to are feeling clearly a lot more optimistic than they were last year and it's consistent maybe even a little bit improved from Q1.", "So those are the positive things that are going on in the market. But I wouldn't extrapolate the second quarter number and roll that out and say we are going to be seeing a $25 billion or $26 billion investment here.", "John Hecht \u2013 JMP Securities", "Mike, if I heard you, you referred to a post quarter approximately $5 million payment on an impaired loan or was it a payment on a $5 million of impaired loan? I just want to make sure I heard that right.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Let me touch on that. We had a couple of accounts that received significant collections of the book balance in the first part of July. So they were impaired as of June 30 and that $5.8 million was collected in the very first part of July.", "Ken Wilcox", "I would like to add just a couple of points to what the answer that Greg was giving around projected loan growth. And those would be that, what we are really seeing out there in the market right now in terms of the relationship between the level of money that's being invested on the one hand, which clearly has gone up and the level of money that's being raised or a new funds which is clearly not going up. It's less a question of the venture industry moving in a bad direction and more a question of the venture industry actually at least in my opinion moving in a good direction, meaning we are seeing a significant calling (ph) going on in the venture industry. People who were unsuccessful in their venture investing in these past several years are falling by the wayside, they are either exiting funds that are substantially successful and will be continuing but individual partners may not have \u2013 had that much of a positive impact or the entire funds at the lower end of the pyramid are falling by the wayside. And but the best funds in the industry at the top of the pyramid are continuing to flourish, they largely flush with dry powder and are continuing to invest.", "Ultimately although it makes for choppy waters in the short run, ultimately in the long run, this can only be good for the industry and we see it as a positive development even though in the short run it may be a little choppy and has been a little choppy. No question about that.", "The other thing that I think we need to add to our answer is that a substantial merchants not only are lending but also of our pipeline and the pipeline that gives us some considerable kinds (ph), things are moving in a good direction comes from companies that have already graduated from the venture capital cycle and are no longer dependant on venture capital infusions in the quarter to grow because they either are past the need for that type of equity infusion or in many cases already public.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bobby Bohlen from KBW.", "Bobby Bohlen \u2013 KBW", "First, I think Mike, this was your very last time you said the business was beginning to attract competition. I was wondering if you could, if I heard that right and if you could I guess elaborate on that.", "Greg Becker", "Let me check that, then Mike can add on. As Mike had said, we are not surprised that there is additional competition or increased competition mainly when you think about the prospects the other executions have, much of the opportunities for their growth historically has been in real estate and real estate related lending. And as we all know, that has been challenged and the outlook for that is it to be \u2013 continue to be challenged for the foreseeable future. With that in mind, everyone has growth goals and the market that we service obviously one that is we clearly enjoy, we enjoy being part of, and so it's not surprising that we are seeing more competition in that space.", "Bobby Bohlen \u2013 KBW", "Is it competition that's been there that's increasing their, I guess happed into (ph) into it or is it new stuff coming in, new participants coming in?", "Greg Becker", "It's mainly the ones that have been out there in the space that kind of around the edges. And we have talked about this increased competitive landscape and the probably for it for quite frankly the last couple of years and as the market turned down, this is one of the things we had talked about. And we have been, again planning for increased competition because of the appeal of the market for a long time. So our goal has been and will continue to be to leverage our strengths, the high touch client service, the people that we have, our ability on the lending and structuring side but also what I would say are the long-term differentiators and probably the two biggest ones from my standpoint are the knowledge and information that we have that is unique that no other institution has and that's part of the knowledge bank or business services area that we continue to develop, although it's early.", "Secondly and probably more importantly, mainly because our clients are going global more early on in their lifecycle is the global capabilities that we have. And those two from my standpoint are the biggest differentiators and those are the ones that are we relying on along with our people to really deal with the increased competition that we are having. So yes, there is more competition. We expected it and we are taking a long-term look on how we are differentiating ourselves.", "Mike Descheneaux", "I think I would add just one sentence to that and that is that it's yet another wave in a string of waves over an extended period of time meaning the last time we had no competition was I think 1992. And since then we have had waves of competition, they come and they go. A very few competitors actually sustain themselves through multiple waves. For the most part they disappear after a wave or two. And so it goes, certainly we are seeing a resurgence of competitive activity. But if the future is anything like the past, it will subside and then we will see more again later. So I think it's something to be concerned about and I would characterize, that's just hyper vigilant in this regard, but it's not, we shouldn't characterize it as a new phenomenon because it's in truth always been there, at least for the past 18 years.", "Bobby Bohlen \u2013 KBW", "Okay, and then second question if you could, you talked about line utilization, I was wondering if you could give kind of the linked quarter where we are in the line utilization for some of your borrowers. Is that across the board or is it in a particular sector?", "Dave Jones", "Overall, the line utilization was up, but very, very little from first quarter. What we saw was that our factoring clients picked up a little bit, our asset base lending dropped off a little bit, our venture capital clients reasonably have significant unfunded commitments at any point in time, drew up on their facilities in the second quarter, but up ever so slightly overall.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin from Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Casey \u2013 Bank of America", "It's Casey (ph) here, filling in for Ken. Good evening. I have a question on the margin guidance of 3 2 to 3 4. We're currently on the year, we're averaging 3 25. I'm implying that there's not much room to go below. But if I heard you right, you expect to more deposit growth coming in the latter half of the year. I'm just trying to figure out what am I missing regarding \u2013 does the loan growth have to outpace that deposit growth for the margin to sort of quit from eroding?", "Ken Wilcox", "I think there's two things Casey. One is actually, did deposit balance as we expect to start declining between now and the end of the year? Then we talked about $1 billion to $1.5 billion are going to come off. So that will certainly, you know, if you're taking that out of cash, which is only 25 basis points here today, they will obviously have a positive effect on the net interest margin. But perhaps, one of the stronger things that will help net interest margin is long growth. So if you bring on loans which you look at our average yields for loans in the neighborhood of over 7%, when you start adding the loans at 7% versus the overall net interest margin of between 3.2 and 3.3, it's going to be accretive overall. So that's where it's going to come from.", "Casey \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, so you see deposits down 1.5 billion period to period end, between now and year end?", "Ken Wilcox", "It's somewhere between 1 billion and 1.5 billion that we expect to move off.", "Casey \u2013 Bank of America", "Okay, alright. I misheard that. And then finally, so the variable rate agency CMOs, what is the yield that you guys get on new investments there?", "Ken Wilcox", "Well, what we've done doing is at the beginning of Q2, it's somewhere in the neighborhood yielding around 80 basis points or so. And they do have like say 1 year to 1.5 year duration or so. And they're indexed to LIBOR.", "Casey \u2013 Bank of America", "And that's primarily going to be the investment strategy going forward?", "Ken Wilcox", "Well we can obviously continue to value where we can get the best yield out there. Again, keeping in mind liquidity. But as you look out at the yield curve and that the investment alternative is just not a whole lot of compelling investments out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Hi guys. Thinking about capital. Lease the way I measure it, you seem to have a decent amount of access. Should I be thinking about any ways you guys can deploy it? And I guess sure, a buyback, would that even be an option?", "Ken Wilcox", "You know we're always exploring what's the best use of capital but I would say first and foremost, mean we certainly expect that we can put it to good use here overtime. So you know, I wouldn't necessarily any share repurchases or buybacks yet at this time. And we have a lot of growth opportunities and our balance sheet has been growing considerably, so I wouldn't expect that in the near term.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "And Ken, I know this is a tough question for all of us in terms of the ability to pay interest on commercial deposits eventually. Should maybe we think about this as a way that cool competitors can use that could increase competition? And maybe that causes banks to hold higher cash balances? I'm just trying to see if you had a more solid opinion on how this could play out.", "Ken Wilcox", "Could you \u2013 not repeat the whole question, but I wasn't quite sure that I got the line of thought?", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Sure. So if banks can say you know, start paying on commercial deposits now and effectively, I think you know, you pay implicitly by credits already but, you make it explicitly. I guess if there's a way that you know, could increase competition of federal banks wanting to start paying higher rates right? Which could mean a little over deposits. I guess would that cause people to maybe keep higher liquidity or cash balances? I'm just trying to think of how this plays out?", "Ken Wilcox", "We are trying to think of how it's going to play out too. And the truth is that it's a very complex set of issues. Fortunately, we have I think, a year or two to figure it out. And we've got lots of people that are doing a lot of modeling and we're testing out various scenarios. I'd like to say that it's a good thing but I have a hard time doing that with a straight face. At the same time, I don't honestly think that it's a necessarily a horrible thing. For the simple reason that we're all in the same boat and I will say that \u2013 I guess I'd rather be SVB that some banks. Because first of all, we certainly have enough deposits to fund our loans, and are probably going to be disinclined to take advantage of (repeal of red cue) to pay up in order to get deposits on to our balance sheet so.", "There are going to be people out there, there are banks that I'm sure you know about that have trouble funding their loan growth, and are going to be paying up now that they have the opportunity in another year. They're going to be paying up in order to get deposits to fund that loan growth and that's going to squeeze their margins. I think that there could be scenarios, in fact, I have envisioned scenarios. And they don't necessarily pertain to the day. But if I look at our, the 20 years I've been here at SVB, there have been times when the ability to pay (R&DDA) would've been a big help to us. And so I think that this is really a multi-faceted question. We obviously have to deal with it. We are concerned but we're confident that we'll figure out ways of using this, potentially even to our advantage overtime.", "Greg Becker", "Hey Mike, this is Greg. Let me just add on a couple of things. One is the institutions that compete with us today. If they wanted to use that today as a way to get deposits from our clients, they could clearly pay up on their money market account balances today and pay much higher rates than we could to try to attract them. So it is slightly different but if they wanted to do that, they have that option, that's number one. Number two, institutions, if they're going to reprice their demand deposits, there's a lot better demand deposits on other bank's balance sheet as well, but they would have to look at repricing. So it's too early to tell how it will shake out. But my feeling is that it won't be as big of an impact as it potentially could be for the reasons that we've already talked about. So it's still too early to tell.", "Ken Wilcox", "Let me add one thing to that, and that is \u2013 it doesn't directly answer your question, but I think it's advantageous to be a bank like ours with a substantial broker dealer. That in most quarters, actually ends up having more client funds than we do on our balance sheet. And that affords us an additional lever in terms of enticing funds in one direction or another. And the way we've structured, that the broker dealer obviously, we end up doing reasonably well no matter where the funds go. So I think that, again facing the (repeal of red cue) I'd rather be us, than some other banks.", "Michael Zaremski \u2013 Credit Suisse", "Okay, those are good points. And last real quick, increased competitions, the existing or the loan yields have been creeping up. Should I think about them not creeping up any more then, if there's increased competition? In terms of the loans in place? Or new loans to go on the book?", "Ken Wilcox", "That's also a tough one to answer because obviously, the best lenders are going to get the best pricing. And it's not always the case that competition results in reduced margins. Maybe Greg would like to add some of the details of that.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Mike. It's also a question of what the mix is. From a standpoint, obviously we have a very diverse loan product set from factoring to commercial finance to traditional loans. And they have a wide range of yield associated with them. And depending upon the mix of that, that can also have an impact on the a quarter-to-quarter basis. Do I expect to see, all things being equal, the mix doesn't change. Do we expect to see a significant change in loan yield? Probably not until interest rates pick back up. So it's mainly, the changes that you've seen have mainly been driven by mix.", "Operator", "Your last question comes from the line of Christopher Nolan from Maxim Group.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "Thanks for taking my call. Is there any geographic classification or change in terms of the loan growth? Are you seeing more from overseas? Or is it just a real change there?", "Dave Jones", "Chris this is Dave. So loan growth on the non-U.S. side. As a percent of that portfolio, is very nice starting from a very small base. But the loan growth that we are seeing is in the U.S. And geography really isn't an issue. Software, hardware, lifescience companies sell globally. They don't sell locally. So the perspective really is the niche. And where we're seeing growth is indicated, largely, lifesciences, some from the venture capital, capital called lines of credits that we provide. So it really is a geographic issue.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "Do you have any update on your comments from the last quarter? Talking about possibly talking about loan portfolios?", "Greg Becker", "Yes Chris, this is Greg. You know I would say the update is the message is the same it was last quarter which is we're always on the lookout and that hasn't change. So there are levels of interest in trying to pick up something that hasn't changed. But as of last quarter, there was nothing eminent that they're looking at that we wouldn't want to comment on the call.", "Christopher Nolan \u2013 Maxim Group", "So purchasing on a loan portfolio is not a factor in terms of your loan-growth guidance for 2010, correct?", "Greg Becker", "No. It is absolutely not going to be our outlook.", "Ken Wilcox", "Which isn't to say we're not constantly looking. So let me then wind up here by stating unequivocally that we are feeling positive. Now I know I say that almost every quarter because we are pretty positive people. But I will, to a point of comparison say that we are feeling, I would say more positive this quarter that we were three months ago. So it's a good trend line in terms of our mood. And there are good reasons why. Think about it, venture capitalists are investing, I would say significantly more actually than they were last year. There are portfolio companies, they're doing better. And I would say significantly better than they were last year.", "Credit quality is improving and is considerably better than it was last year. Loan balances are up and it was a hard time saying significantly up over last year but after all this waiting, it's nice to see them going up. Deposits are growing like topsy and fortunately, we have the broker dealer to encourage some of them into. And there are significantly more and better access right now than there were a year ago.", "So in short, pretty much everything is looking up to one degree or another, and accordingly, our outlook on the future is looking up as well. And that's it.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen for joining this conference call, and it does conclude.

My name is Amanda and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group third quarter 2010 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you. I would like to introduce Meghan O\u2019Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Ms. O\u2019Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Thank you, Operator. And thank you for all joining us. We welcome you to our third quarter 2010 earnings call. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "I would also like to remind you that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in the call.", "We will limit the length of the call to one hour, which will include Q&A with our CEO Ken Wilcox, our CFO Mike Descheneaux and other members of management. During the Q&A section, we will ask you to limit your questions to one primary and one follow-up question before getting back in the queue to enable other participants to ask their questions.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Ken Wilcox.", "Ken Wilcox", "Thank you, Meghan and thank all of you for joining us today. I\u2019d like to start by saying I\u2019m very happy with our results in the third quarter. We earned $0.89 per share. We delivered loan growth of 37% on an annualized basis, over half of which came from new clients. We added 423 new clients.", "We maintained high credit quality. We had $3.8 million in net gains on equity warrants. And finally, we realized $6.2 million in gains net of non-controlling interests on our SVB Capital and other venture capital related investments. So all around, I think it was a pretty good quarter. Of course, Mike will give you some more details on the numbers in just a few minutes. But first, I\u2019d like to spend some time talking about what we\u2019re seeing in our markets, what we\u2019re hearing from our clients and what we\u2019re working on, what keeps me up at night and what we\u2019re expecting in the future.", "Let me start with the venture capital markets. They continue to improve, although of course, their progress is somewhat mixed. On the one hand, exits of venture-backed companies remained strong in the third quarter with 109 acquisitions and 14 IPOs. Year-to-date, there have been twice as many acquisitions of venture-backed companies than in all of 2009, and average deal sizes have continued to increase. On the other hand, venture capitalists invested 31% fewer dollars and did 19% fewer deals in the third quarter. We think the seasonality of the venture capital business has a lot to do with those numbers. Traditionally, the summer months are slow for the industry. By contrast, prospects for the fourth quarter are looking pretty good.", "Our venture capital clients tell us they are expecting a stronger fourth quarter, both in terms of investments and exits. The innovation markets overall are showing clear signs of improvement even as the economy at large still struggles. At SVB we have access to information on the performance of thousands of companies every quarter.", "Our clients. In these past several months and in the past year, we have seen steady improvements among our client base in sales growth, operating margins and liquidity. These improvements have come from across all major sectors, including hardware, software, life sciences and clean tech. Our clients are definitely building momentum. The latest batch of earnings reports from Bellwether Technology companies such as Apple and Google would appear to confirm these improvements.", "So our outlook on our markets is positive. As our clients\u2019 opportunities improve, we see significant opportunities for growth ahead. Our ability to take advantage of these opportunities requires us to make prudent investments in our infrastructure, in new products and in our global expansion. To this end, we are continuing our work of replacing our IT backbone so that we can operate even more effectively as a global company and position ourselves in the future. We are introducing new products for web-based banking, mobile banking and Global Treasury Management, all of which our clients have expressly requested. We continued to make strong progress in our efforts in the UK, China, India and Israel.", "As you know, we have applied for banking licenses in both the UK and India, and we recently opened a new office in Beijing. We are building a global risk management business and information services infrastructure to support this expansion. We continue to develop our model for serving cleantech companies and are hiring market-facing employees to drive our growth efforts overall. We are refining on our approach to SVB capital to ensure our focus on the areas of greatest opportunity.", "And through all of this, we continue to invest in people through new hires and through the further development of our existing employees. And we are continuing to build our reputation as an outstanding place to work in order to attract the very best people.", "In short, I believe we are doing everything in our power to continue to position ourselves for success. These efforts require time, cash and capital, but we believe they will all pay off in the future. We do have a number of challenges in the near term. In particular, there are three things that I worry about.", "First, is the uncertainty of the economy at large, while things are looking good for our clients and for SVB, if the economy were to experience a double dip, it could change our outlook significantly. Second is the changing regulatory environment. I think we are well-positioned to handle new regulatory requirements, whatever they may be. Still, new requirements will complicate in already challenging business environment and add to the general uncertainty in the markets in the near term. My third worry is increasing competition. Our clients are doing well and as a result they have become attractive prospects for banks whose traditional markets are not growing. We are being aggressive without taking undue risks, but it is a focused and intense effort.", "As you can see from our results this quarter, we are succeeding. Despite these challenges, we are feeling confident about our future. We believe we have significant growth opportunities ahead and a clear strategy for seizing them. And while I can\u2019t give you a specific outlook for 2011, I will give you a general sense of our expectations. We expect continued solid results as our clients\u2019 businesses improve. We are estimating average loan growth of between 10 and 20% for the full year of 2011. Along with higher loans, we expect to see aggregate revenues from our fee based services increase at a rate in the high single or low double-digits. We anticipate continued modest improvements in venture capital fund raising and investing and significant improvements in these venture capital exit markets, primarily related to M&A. We expect low interest rates to continue to hold down our yields in our net interest margin, but our higher loan volumes should generate higher interest income.", "Expenses are likely to be higher as a result of our continued investment in our business, especially if our performance continues to improve. Our preliminary estimate is that expenses in 2011 could grow at a rate similar to 2010\u2019s growth. These expectations all assume there will not be another significant economic disruption in the year ahead. As we prepare to close out 2010, our morale here at SVB is decidedly high. We have a wonderful group of employees.", "Their individual and team efforts have contributed tremendously to our success during the year, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to do so in the future. We are all feeling good about the year ahead. Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thanks, Ken, and thank you all for joining us today. We had a very solid third quarter, which reflects improving business conditions for our clients. These improvements are beginning to translate into growth for us. There are few things I would like to highlight from the quarter.", "First is strong loan growth. Second is continued high credit quality and improving underlying trends. Third is strong net interest income despite a lower net interest margin. Fourth is gains on our investment portfolio, owing to the sale of agency-backed securities and valuation gains on our venture related investments. Fifth is stable fee income, primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange fee income.", "And finally, sixth is stable non-interest expense that reflects higher compensation costs related to new hires and our strong performance. Let us move on to the details starting with loan growth. We are pleased that our return to loan growth has played out as we predicted it would. We said in the first quarter, we expected to see average loan growth in the second half of the year. In Q2, we reported growing momentum in the pipeline and peered in loan growth. In the third quarter, we grew average loans by $387 million or 9.4% to $4.5 billion. End of period loans grew by $409 million or 9.2% to $4.9 billion, which means we are starting Q4 on strong footing.", "Demand for loans came from clients in all sectors with the largest increase in loans to our software clients. Growth came from all segments from early stage to corporate finance. The number of loans booked during the quarter increased by 13% over the second quarter. These loans represented $535 million of new dollars funded from new clients. Our pipeline remained relatively strong going into the fourth quarter.", "Although it was lower because we closed so many loans in Q3. With respect to loan utilization, it held steady at 45%. Moving forward, we believe that an improving environment for technology companies will ultimately lead to high utilization as well as increased commitments. Historically, utilization rates for SVB has been closer to 50%.", "Moving on to credit quality. It remains strong with continuing improvement in almost all credit metrics. We noted last quarter that we could see somewhat higher net charge-offs during Q3, primarily has a result of unusually low charge-offs in Q2 and we did. Net charge-offs were $8.4 million or 73 basis points annualized. About 95% of that figure came from our early stage portfolio, as expected. In any environment, we would consider this level of charge-offs to be a very good performance. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $11 million in the third quarter compared to $7.4 million in the second quarter, primarily due to loan growth and the low levels of net charge offs in Q2.", "Our allowance for loan losses increased to $74.4 million, compared to $71.8 million in the second quarter. Although as a percentage of gross loans, it fell to 1.52% compared to 1.60% in the second quarter due to decreases in our impaired loan balances and improving credit quality. Non-performing loans decreased by $6.2 million during the third quarter to $45 million or 0.92% of total gross loans.", "Since the end of the quarter, we have received payments on loans that had been reflected in our non-performing balances, including $8.8 million related to one loan that went on non-performing status in the first quarter of 2009. That payment and others have further reduced our current impaired loan balances, although they will have no P&L impact because there was no reserve associated with them, as it was not needed.", "Overall, our credit trends reflect the high quality of our loan portfolio, as evidenced by a further decline of 4% in classified loans, which are now close to historical levels for a normal market cycle. These results are due to our continued emphasis on strong portfolio management and the improving business environment for our clients.", "Moving to net interest income and net interest margin, net interest income remained strong in the third quarter, holding steady at $106.3 million, despite the historically low interest rate environment. The composition of our investment portfolio shifted as older higher yielding investments matured or were paid down during the quarter and we reinvested those funds at currently available yields.", "We continued to invest excess liquidity from our deposit flows into our securities portfolio. Overall, these activities were accretive to net interest income, but average yield on that portfolio was 42 basis points lower for the quarter.", "We made purchases totaling $1.8 billion during the third quarter, primarily in agency debentures and variable rate CMOs. As I noted earlier, we sold $493 million of certain agency-backed available for sale securities toward the end of the quarter. Overall, we increased our average available for sale of securities portfolio by $87.6 million, to $5.3 billion. The sales of security were consistent with our ongoing efforts to efficiently manage our available liquid resources and mitigate duration risk in the portfolio.", "Net interest income also reflects higher interest expense of 500,000 related to our issuance of $315 million in 5.375% senior notes in September. These senior notes will also add to our interest expense in Q4 and the first quarter of 2011. Approximately $250 million of the net proceeds will be used to repay our 3.875% convertible senior notes due in April 2011, with the remaining going to general corporate purposes, including the growth initiatives that Ken described.", "Average deposits held steady for the first time in 12 quarters at $11.9 billion, while period-end deposits rose by $275 million to $12.4 billion. We believe the staying power of our deposits so far reflects the continued lack of compelling yield opportunities in the market.", "Average total client fund balances rose by $484 million, owing to our clients\u2019 strong liquidity position and new client acquisitions. Our net interest margin was lower at 3.14% compared to 3.20% in the second quarter, primarily due to changes in the composition of our securities portfolio and greater competition in loan pricing.", "Clearly, net interest margin compression is a common issue for everyone in this low interest rate environment. In our view, the highest and best use of our cash is for loans, and we are doing our best to deploy cash in lending. In addition, we are doing everything we can to maximize our net interest income and yield, but we do not believe it is in the best interest of anyone to chase yield and incur unnecessary duration or credit risk, and we won\u2019t chase it.", "Turning to non-interest income, it increased significantly in the third quarter to $86.2 million compared to $40.2 million in the second quarter. This increase was due primarily to two things, first with net gains of $23.6 million from our sale of agency-backed securities during the quarter.", "Second was net gains of $23 million related to evaluation gains and distributions from our venture capital and private equity related investments. As Ken said earlier, net of non-controlling interest, we realized $6.2 million from these gains. That compares to net gains of $4 million on these investments in the second quarter or 400,000 net of non-controlling interest.", "Our fund performance has generally improved throughout the year, thanks to the improving liquidity mainly through M&A. We also saw a $3.8 million gain from Equity One assets, thanks to a healthy M&A market. Although I would caution you not to use the third quarter as the basis for future run rates, nevertheless, we are pleased with Q3 results.", "With respect to our core fee income, that is all other fee income outside of the other category, it remained relatively stable during the quarter. One highlight for the quarter was foreign exchange income, which was slightly higher and it reached an all time high. Overall, our fee income reflects a modestly improving environment for our clients, which we expect to continue.", "Moving to non-interest expense. Although, it wasn\u2019t unchanged at $104.2 million in the third quarter, I want to point out that this number actually reflects higher compensation and benefits expenses related to two things. The first is our strong performance. We are outperforming our internal targets and expect to exceed our annual forecasts, and that resulted in increased incentive compensation accruals during the quarter.", "The second driver was higher employee related expenses due to the growth initiatives Ken outlined earlier. We are investing in market-facing people to help us grow our business. Expenses overall were flat because we had lower FDIC assessments after opting out of the TAG program, as well as a lower provision for unfunded credit commitments. Our FDIC assessment expense in the future could be impacted by new requirements related to Dodd-Frank and The Consumer Protection Act, but at this point it is too soon to tell.", "Now I move on to our updated outlook for the full year 2010. We are doing something a little different this quarter. We know that annual guidance can become less useful as you approach the end of the year. In the spirit of maintaining meaningful guidance where it makes sense, we have now narrowed our guidance on certain annual ranges.", "Second, we have translated certain refined annual ranges into fourth quarter guidance. Our goal as we approach the end of the year is to ensure our guidance is still meaningful. This does not signal a move to quarterly guidance going forward and please keep in mind that these are our good faith estimates of where we will end up for 2010 based on what we know today. Actual results may differ. So let me start with loans.", "We expect average 2010 loan balances to decrease at a percentage rate between 6.5 and 7.25%. That would translate into higher average loan balances for the fourth quarter of between $4.7 billion and $4.9 billion. We expect average deposits to increase at a percentage rate between 32% and 34% for 2010. That equates to fourth quarter average deposits of between $12 billion and 12.4 billion and is an increase from our prior 2010 outlook.", "We had said before, we thought, we would see an outflow of deposits from the balance sheets of $1 billion to $1.5 billion once we opted out of the TAG extended insurance program. But the prevailing low interest rate environment has led clients to keep their deposits on balance sheets in the absence of compelling investment yields.", "We expect net interest income for 2010 to increase between 10% and 11%. That is consistent with our prior outlook calling for an annual increase and a percentage increase in the low double digits. We expect our net interest margin to be between 3.1% and 3.2% for the full year 2010. That is a decrease from our prior guidance owing to continued deposit growth, the fact that the low rate environment is keeping deposits from moving off the balance sheet and the issuance of our senior notes in the third quarter. This outlook assumes fourth quarter net interest margin between 3.0% and 3.2%.", "We expect net loan charge offs of less than $50 million for the full year 2010. That is a significant improvement from our prior guidance that charge offs would be less than 2009 levels of $125 million. We have not made any changes to the remaining items in our outlook that pertain to credit quality. But as we noted, we have had five successive quarters of improvements in credit quality.", "Finally, we increased our outlook for non-interest expense and now expect it to increase at a percentage rate in the low 20s for the full year 2010. This increase is due to compensation and FTE increases related to our strong performance and our growth initiatives. There are a few items I have not covered in the outlook. And that is because we have not refined our guidance on those. Please refer to the outlook section of our press release for more information on those items.", "Overall, we are pleased with our results in the third quarter. We are encouraged by how the technology industry is doing overall and the fact that improvements we anticipated in loans in particular have become reality. Our clients are outperforming the broader economy and they appear to be gaining momentum.", "We believe we have the right business model not only for today, but for the future. We will continue to do everything in our power to remain competitive, win new clients and leverage the power of our platform to differentiate ourselves in the market.", "Thank you. And now I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the call for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Regarding Ken\u2019s 2011 outlook, unless I misheard this, you\u2019re looking for 10% to 20% loan growth. These are high single-digit, low double-digits and then expenses up low 20%. Am I misreading this that the expense growth is a bit more robust than the revenue outlook for 2011?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Yeah, that\u2019s right. Just to try and maybe tweak that or clarify that a bit. So our expectation is not, we\u2019re not going to see the 20% low, 20% growth. What he was really referring to is some of the core line items, ex-compensation of those areas. But again, we\u2019re not expecting expense growth of that 20%. With our fourth quarter results, we will certainly tweak that number. So no, don\u2019t be alarmed that we\u2019re going to grow expenses at 20% again in 2011.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JP Morgan", "Mike, maybe a follow-up, given the sharp increase in securities you saw again this quarter, I understand why the yield would be flowing, but why would interest income on the securities be falling? Did you have higher yielding securities called away from you?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Primarily you have quite a fair amount that are maturing, as well as we opted to sell some of the securities we mentioned, the $500 million. So those were little bit higher yielding securities, so you would see some decrease in interest income from the securities.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Pretty impressive loan growth this quarter.", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Thanks, Joe.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "I had actually several questions on the loan growth, and I guess first is I recall the growth last quarter was somewhat lumpy particularly with the few large credits, was the increase much more granular this quarter?", "David Jones", "", "Joe, this is Dave. And our loan growth was more granular in terms of there were several accounts of more moderate size that contribute to it. I would characterize acquisition financing as a core theme in that. So, in some cases buying corporates, in some cases our private equity friends making acquisitions and I\u2019d also characterize the fact that there was as much money spent in acquisitions as a good read of private equity venture capital\u2019s opinion of the economy.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "I guess on that, Dave, I did see, in that large loan table, that the venture capital private equity piece was up. Is that this acquisition financing you\u2019re talking about, or is that also a return to some of the capital call line business that you\u2019ve done?", "David Jones", "", "So, the acquisition financing would be outside of that venture capital, capital call. What you\u2019re seeing there, Joe, is the capital call drills.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "So that business is starting to pick up again, it sounds like?", "David Jones", "", "Yes, it is.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then lastly, I guess trying to get a little more sense of where the growth comes from. It sounded like you added several new clients, over 400 new clients, in the quarter. Who are you taking market share from? Is it primarily banks or some of the non-bank players? At the same time, you\u2019re saying you\u2019re seeing increased competition, so maybe it\u2019s fair amount of growth just from existing clients drawing down existing lines. So I guess, if you could give us a little more color on all that, Dave, thanks.", "Greg Becker", "", "Yes, Joe, so it\u2019s Greg Becker. Let me answer that and then Dave can get on to it. So the number that Ken talked about, as far as new client growth, that\u2019s both borrowing clients and non-borrowing clients. And that\u2019s a very broad section of company that comes in with the largest number coming in from the very early stage. And as you will hear about venture capital activity and stuff, there is still a lot of pre-venture backed companies that our teams are able to bring in the door, angel-backed companies.", "So I\u2019d just say overall, client acquisition has gone very well. Where those companies come from, it is traditional commercial banks, mainly. Those are obviously almost all coming over from traditional banking clients or banks. As far as the growth overall, it is broad-based. We had, as we said in the past, some of the growth continues to come from global and we expect that to continue. And then the rest of it is pretty broad-based across various niches, segments and stages. As Ken and Mike both alluded to, we felt very good about the loan growth and composition in the third quarter.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Your line is now open.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners", "", "Mike, I think it was in your discussion where you talked about the potential foreseeing higher FDIC cost as a result of some of the regulatory changes. I am just wondering, are you referring specifically to that you guys being put back into like a mandatory TAG program? And I\u2019m wondering if so, what that means for your thoughts in terms of maybe trying to push some of this excess liquidity back off balance sheet?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Well, it\u2019s still to be seen on how all that\u2019s going to play out. It is a little bit too early, as far as the FDIC rates or entering mandatorily into the program. But as far as our thoughts on moving deposits off and yes that is certainly going to play into that and help us consider the economics of deposits overall, if we have to continue to pay a higher levels of deposit cost on that. So that is something we\u2019re very, very attuned to and we\u2019re waiting to see how that\u2019s going to play out.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners", "", "Okay. And then maybe just following up on Steven\u2019s question regarding the securities. The securities were sold in the quarter, what was kind of the rationale for taking that gain, given that there is really no great place to redeploy that, notwithstanding the loan growth and such that you\u2019ve seen?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Yeah. First overall, it was actually very good for us. As you can see, that we recorded a $23.6 million gain. But if you go back to kind of the higher level with the way we\u2019ve been positioning our portfolio, both from a credit perspective and a duration perspective, and goes back to Q2, where we sold off all of our non-agency securities all we have left at least theoretically in a credit risk is the municipal securities.", "So this was just part of that process to continually enhanced the credit and liquidity position. A lot of what we sold off, Aaron, was some of the smaller lots, odd lots, $100,000, $200,000, $300,000 types of bonds. So it just helped us also operationally and logistically, and in end of the day, also, these securities were priced very, very rich, if you will, for lack of a better term. So again, all-in-all, for us, overall both from a quantitative and qualitative perspective, it was a very sensible thing for us to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "In terms of the securities transactions, can you talk about how that impacted the margin in the quarter? Just particularly given what yields they came off at and then the reinvestment yields?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Yes, John, those securities were sold towards the end of the quarter. So it had, I would say, a marginally, a small impact. I think the bigger impact will be going forward in the Q4.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "Then, in terms of your outlook for the margin, just given how the securities transaction impacts it, would you say that this kind of resets the margin at a kind of a trough level, just given what you\u2019re doing on the securities book? And could we assume that we could see some upside through 2011 as loan growth materializes, or it accelerates?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "I think that\u2019s a very good way to look at it. I think what plays out in Q2. If you look at our guidance for Q4, where essentially we\u2019re saying between 3% and 3.2%. I\u2019d like to say that that is kind of the trough. And as you know, there\u2019s quite a few things that do impact our net interest margin. So if deposits continue to run up, that obviously has a play on it. But yes, going to 2000 level, we are hopeful that loans will continue to grow, because that has a very positive impact on the net interest margin.", "So answer to your point and answer to your question is yes, I\u2019d like to see Q4 as kind of that trough, if you will. But that\u2019s assuming that deposits won\u2019t continue to increase. And again, that\u2019s assuming that loans are going to hold their own and continue to grow. So yeah, we\u2019re hopeful that that\u2019s going to be the trough.", "John Pancari - Evercore Partners", "", "And this is also lastly, just assumes what you\u2019ve done in the portfolio, the repositioning of the bond book, I\u2019m assuming it helps you mitigate the risk of, if quantitative easing is more sizable than what some of us fear.", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Yeah, I think so. I mean the way we\u2019re positioned in that portfolio, we\u2019re bringing down the duration extension risk and the things of that nature. So I think we are positioning ourselves very, very nicely for these types of things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Hecht from JMP Securities. Your line is now open.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "", "How are you? A little bit more on the loan growth. I understand it was somewhat balanced on a size and a sector basis, but you would think around 40% was in loans larger than $20 million. Can you just talk about the competitive framework in that lending market, and maybe give us some perspective on spreads and terms there?", "David Jones", "", "This is Dave. So, most of those transactions that would have met that criteria in the disclosure of above 20, I would describe them as very, very marginally above 20, in terms of size. And most of them, as I indicated earlier, would have been in acquisition financing. We are enjoying in that business a spread that is above our prime and I will remind you that our prime is 4%. It is compressed from what it was 18 months ago, 12 months ago, further in the trough of the economy, but we\u2019re still enjoying good spreads at above our prime rate.", "John Hecht - JMP Securities", "", "And my last question would be, Mike, you talked about 45% loan utilization rate and historical average of 50. Can you quantify what that would mean if you moved? I know nothing is going to happen overnight. But if you moved from 45 to 50% utilization, what would that mean in terms of potential loan add?", "David Jones", "", "This is Dave. And we have calculated that and there are a lot of assumptions to be input into that calculation. But ballpark it with a number that is 200, maybe $400 million if we in one period, to go from 45% to 50%.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Bobby Bohlen from KBW. Your line is now open.", "Bobby Bohlen - KBW", "", "Thanks for taking my questions. You mentioned competition on the loan side. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing competition on the side of lenders too. I mean, Silicon Valley obviously has a premiere franchise and it\u2019s harder for new banks to break in. What are you seeing on competition there?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "This is Ken. Let me start and make a couple of comments and then pass it on to Greg perhaps, with some more detail. But what we are seeing, basically, is that a number of banks that really have never taken any interest in this market in the past are drawn into it simply because it\u2019s probably the only good market left in the U.S. economy. Just about everything else other banks have focused on in the past is suffering in one way or another. Who really wants to be in residential real estate? Who really wants to be in commercial real estate? Where is American manufacturing? All of these markets are suffering and, as a result, because we\u2019ve done as well as we have over the years, we\u2019re starting to attract some banks that really have never thought about this before.", "Exactly how that plays out remains to be seen, but I will say that we are definitely winning more than we\u2019re losing. It\u2019s just that there are a lot more dog fights than would have been true a couple of years ago. Yeah, and with that, I would like to pass it to Greg, maybe to put a little color around it with some more detail.", "Greg Becker", "", "Yeah maybe, just a little more color. As we\u2019ve said in the past, being a market leader and being in a sector that is doing well, obviously as people think about places to go, we are a natural place for that to look. Clearly, we have a lot of strengths that has kept our employees here over a long period of time. And that goes from the culture that we have, the product set, the growth nature of our business, the fact that we are different in many other things.", "So that being said though, we have to be competitive when how we approach our employees, and make sure that we\u2019re competitive across the board. And that, in some cases means that, from a compensation perspective, we have to be competitive and very competitive, but at the same time, create opportunities for our clients. So, it is something we\u2019re very sensitive to. I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of that to-date. And we need to remain vigilant on that in the coming years.", "Bobby Bohlen - KBW", "", "And then as a follow-up to that. As you\u2019re building out your global lending, who do you compete with for lenders globally?", "Greg Becker", "", "The one major market that we\u2019re really looking to build out right now is in the UK. And we have a combination of both people there that we\u2019re moving from the U.S. over to London, as well as hiring some very strong talent in market. The advantage we have there, as we look at bringing people in, I think all of us have read about the challenges that the UK banks have had. And the fact that they are not growing, the fact that they\u2019re having challenges in getting credits approved and are very internally focused.", "So if you contrast that with our strategy, we present a very appealing platform for strong individuals to come onboard. And so we\u2019re able to attract so far some extremely strong talent to our platform in the UK. Now again, we\u2019re talking about small numbers overall, but we feel very good about our ability to attract the talent in UK, and I think that will be the case in other markets as well.", "Bobby Bohlen - KBW", "", "And I hope you\u2019re able to keep up the strong momentum you\u2019re showing.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from line of Christopher Nolan from CRT Capital. Your line is now open.", "Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital", "", "Quick question on the unrealized gains, Mike, how much for the gains from the funds and funds so forth? Was that all from SVB capital?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "Chris that\u2019s primarily came from the funds that we had to manage funds that are roughly a little bit over $6 million from those funds. There was nothing that really stood out that was significant. Each fund had some evaluations gains from $500,000 to $1 million. So, it was pretty much across the board and very reflective of the financial markets that we\u2019re seeing. We\u2019re very pleased at the moment on that progress.", "Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital", "", "A couple quarters ago, you guys mentioned for SVB, capital\u2019s approaching the inflection point of the J curve. Are we starting to see that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "It goes by different funds. But overall, I would say we are right at that or crossing on that. And again, we\u2019re hopeful to continue on the upward movement. It\u2019s been a while that we\u2019ve been down in there and so it\u2019s kind of nice to start to begin to poke our head above water.", "Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital", "", "So you\u2019re more optimistic that we would see repeat gains on this for quarters...", "Mike Descheneaux", "", "And assuming the economy continues to move forward and the technology sector in particular continues to experience a little bit more resilience and a little bit more confidence that going forward that growth is going to come.", "Christopher Nolan - CRT Capital", "", "And I guess for Ken, any update on the status for SVB capital vis-\u00e0-vis the Volcker rule?", "Ken Wilcox", "", "Not really. I would say that we are about as actively engaged as anybody else out there in terms of providing the kind of information and background to the people that are transforming legislation into regulation as anybody. And I think that our opinion is valued because we arguably know quite a bit more about the space than most people do.", "But, we\u2019re still as an industry, I would say quite away from knowing exactly how it\u2019s all going to play out. Having said that, there are scenarios and I think probable scenarios under which, if anything, this could be construed as a benefit to us in the long haul. But, it\u2019s way too early to tell. But it really is. And anything I said would be guesswork at this point.", "Operator", "(Operator Instructions). Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.", "Mike Zaremski - Credit Suisse", "", "I\u2019m going to try and ask one on loan growth, I know there has been a bunch asked already. But outside from a double dip, is there one or two major assumptions you\u2019re making in your 2011 loan growth estimates that could I guess maturely change your assumptions, like for example, acquisition related financing outlook or maybe a jump in the utilization rates or overseas loans?", "David Jones", "", "That\u2019s a good question. I think that clearly if there was a sentiment from the portfolio companies that might be buying other companies if there was a sentiment within the private equity environment, that things were less certain, but the same has almost fall back on the presumption about the economy. So I think that we are going to experience a good growth, plenty of opportunities to do so, both domestically and internationally.", "Ken Wilcox", "So let me weigh in with my own view on that which corresponds to Dave and I\u2019m probably saying the same thing Dave saying, but in my own words here. And that is that when we talk about loan growth in the potentially 10% to 20% range, that is not just because we feel good or because we are shooting in the dark.", "There are a number of identifiable trends that would support that contention and I would just like to list five of them for you, a couple of which you already mentioned for me, thank you. A one would be as there continues to be M&A activity growing in our market, which there is ample evidence of, then the potential for appropriately sized acquisition financing, it is a greater rather than smaller. That\u2019s number one.", "Number two is, we have witnessed in these past few quarters identifiable positive trend lines in our portfolio with respect to revenue growth. And that usually leads to a modest re-leveraging. So a re-leveraging or in other words, higher utilization rates on existing facilities can contribute to loan growth.", "Number three would be as we expand our activities overseas, and I know you mentioned that yourself, but we anticipate that there\u2019s going to be measureable loan growth in that arena as well. Number four would be we have a lot more competition we did before, but we\u2019re also winning more than we are losing. So taking market share could contribute to increased loan growth as we believe or know that it did this quarter.", "And then number five would be our basic business model, because as you know our basic business model in short, with over-simplified order would be that we bring as high percentage of companies in at the onset as we possibly can and then we keep them as they grow. So you could say and of course these are general numbers, but you could say that 80%, 90% of our new business development activity focuses on raw startups and a disproportionately large percentage of our revenues come from larger companies.", "So in the natural course there will be many smaller companies that will survive and become larger companies and as they become larger companies, their capacity for leverage increases. And all five of those are objectively identifiable trends of which we\u2019ve seen evidence in these past couple of quarters. So unless there is a dramatic change in the overall economic environment, we would anticipate that all five of these could contribute to increased loan growth and we are estimating between 10% and 20%.", "Operator", "And at this time there are no further questions. I would now like to turn it back to Ken Wilcox for closing remarks.", "Ken Wilcox", "Well thank you very much for attending today. I don\u2019t have much in the way of closing remarks. I\u2019d just like to say, we do believe it was a good quarter. We hope you do too. We believe that we not only had good earnings, but we are also using some portion of that to invest in future earnings on your behalf.", "I will tell you that you can be absolutely certain that we are dedicated to producing the highest returns for you that we possibly can. And I also want to take just 10 seconds here of your time to thank our employees who worked extremely hard this quarter in this increasingly competitive atmosphere and as I\u2019ve said a couple of times already have won a lot more them they have lost. And I think we are all grateful to them for their efforts.

My name is [Chris] and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group Q4 2012 Earnings Conference Call.", "All lines have been placed on mute to prevent background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].", "Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, [Chris]. And thank you all for joining us today. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2012 earnings call. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here today to talk about our fourth quarter and full-year results. They'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "I'd like to remind everyone that our fourth quarter earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com. I will caution you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion today may include references to non-GAAP financial measures, and information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We have a lot to cover today with the quarter, full year, and then our 2013 outlook, so we are going to try to power through it quickly and make sure we get to all your questions within the hour. But please do try to limit yourselves to one primary and one follow-up question to enable other participants to ask theirs.", "So, thank you, and I'll turn it over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Thank you, Meghan, and thank you all for joining us today. We had an excellent quarter that exceeded our expectations. We delivered an earnings per share of $1.12, net income of $50.4 million, and return on equity of 10.99%. We beat consensus by a generous margin, and for the full year, delivered exceptional performance in all of our primary business drivers. For the full year, EPS was $3.91, net income was $175 million, and our ROE was 10%.", "Mike will go into more detail on our financial results for the quarter and the yearend in just a few minutes. What I'm going to talk about is our strategy, some of the non-financial accomplishments from 2012 that supports this strategy and the year ahead.", "Our strategy is to be the best financial services partner and thought leader for high-growth innovation companies and their investors wherever they are in the world. Increasingly, through our private bank, the strategy includes the individuals who are part of this ecosystem as well. As we see it, this vision requires three things.", "The first is the ability to support our clients at all stages. This means establishing a lifelong relationship, working with these companies at their critical startup stages, and supporting them as they grow to mature name brands. It also means growing our ranks of already established larger innovation clients. The second element is the ability to support our clients wherever they are. Since we already are in every key domestic market, this primarily means extending our capabilities to key global markets. The third element is the operational infrastructure products and services to support the first two elements. This is about creating a simple, seamless and increasingly mobile client experience. It's also about building a platform that will allow us to grow efficiently.", "So let's look at what we achieved in each of these categories in 2012 and why we feel it was such a great year. Starting with the first piece of the strategy, supporting our clients at all stages. SVB has been the dominant player among venture-backed companies for years, and the pace of our new client wins in this area suggests that our lead is becoming even more entrenched. In 2012 we added more than 1,800 new venture-backed and non-venture-backed early-stage clients, a record year. In addition to maintaining our market share of high-growth innovation companies, we saw a noticeable improvement among the highest profile fastest-growth companies. We believe these companies are the most likely to go public, get acquired for substantial amounts of money, and be recognizable by all of you.", "At the same time, we expanded our share of companies with annual revenues greater than $75 million. Our loan balances from these clients grew more than 60% in 2012, surpassing $2 billion and driving the majority of our loan growth. This growth included 39 buyout financing deals, which allowed us to increase our market share position with virtually every one of our key private equity sponsors. Increasingly, we're becoming the go-to financing partner for middle market technology buyouts in the innovation space. Our success in growing our larger company market share helped to drive 16% annual growth in core fee income given that these clients tend to use more products and services.", "And as good a year as we had, we are just getting started. There is still a tremendous amount of opportunity with these later-stage clients.", "A second part of our strategy is supporting our clients wherever they are, and in particular, globally. To this end, in 2012 we accomplished two major milestones in our global strategy. Specifically we obtained our banking license and opened up a branch in the UK, a task that included building a banking platform from the ground up. With the UK branch up and running today, we're adding new accounts at a healthy pace. As of December 31st we had 135 new accounts and are growing. These new accounts are coming from new clients in the UK market and US clients doing business in the UK and in Europe. While loan and deposit balances are still relatively small as a percentage of our overall base, roughly 3% of loans, we expect them to grow rapidly in the coming years.", "We also launched our new joint venture bank in China, which the Chinese regulators gave us approval to pursue at the end of 2011. Today we're gradually opening up in country accounts and building out our products and services to support local innovation companies as well as foreign companies doing business in China. Of course, China is a much longer-term play for us. Our JV bank can currently only open up onshore US dollar accounts. So we expect it to be three to five years before we begin generating meaningful revenues there. There's still a lot to do in both the UK and China, but we're pleased with our progress.", "The final piece of realizing our vision is the infrastructure products and services to support our growth. This includes simplifying and improving our client experience, introducing relative products and services and creating a platform to help us grow efficiently. As part of this effort, in 2012 we implemented three new technology solutions for our clients that are transforming our product and service delivery. These include a mobile banking platform that had the fastest adoption rate of any product or service in our history. One client called the app a big leap forward for SVB with great usability.", "We also rolled out the industry's first tablet-based B2B payment solution which has also been very well-received. And we launched the new streamlined client onboarding service. This is not only great for our clients but for SVB because it takes a multitude of forms it took to open an account and simplifies it to one process. Now clients enter their information online one time and that populates everything. Clients have told us it's a great experience. It's a great tool and one of my favorites, super awesome. Yes, that is a direct quote.", "On the efficiency front, we opened an operational hub in Tempe, Arizona, which helps us by giving us access to a great pool of talent, particularly in banking operations and IT, while lowering our long-term operational expense growth trajectory and improving our business continuity framework.", "Before I turn to the year ahead, I have two additional achievements that bear mentioning. First, we improved our scores on our annual client satisfaction survey for the fifth consecutive year. While the trend line in client satisfaction levels are great overall, I'm most proud of our exceptional satisfaction ratings in our private bank and private equity services which are considered best in class.", "And finally, last year we were recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the best places to work, something I'm particularly proud of.", "Looking at 2013 and beyond, we believe the environment for our clients remains positive. A recent survey from the National Venture Capital Association suggests that VCs are reasonably optimistic about 2013 coming off a relatively strong 2012. They see opportunities in business and healthcare IT which appear to be overtaking the consumer applications that dominated the last few years. Global activity is also expected to play a more meaningful role with China, India and Latin America cited as important potential sources of startups.", "And while fundraising challenges are expected to persist, the majority of VCs and startup CEOs surveyed said they expected that the fundraising environment in 2013 to be the same as or better than 2012. Solid venture capital activity coupled with solid corporate venture and angel investment points to a good year of company formation in 2013.", "Our pipeline going into 2013 remains healthy and our clients for the most part feel positive about their opportunities this year. In terms of the buyout and acquisition loans that have driven most of our growth, we see ample demand and continue to pursue the highest-quality deals. This is of course assuming the economy continues its gradual improvement.", "Many of the initiatives we focused on in 2012 will remain priorities for 2013. We'll continue our focus on engaging with the best startups early in their lifecycles and growing our ranks of larger companies. We'll work hard to be the best possible partner to our innovation clients and we'll use everything we've learned in the last 30 years to ensure our success.", "We will continue to build momentum in our global strategy. While we completed a lot of the heavy lifting and established the infrastructure in the UK and in China, we're actively building partnerships, winning new clients, and expanding our global balance sheet in order to make the most of these opportunities and investments. We will continue to refine and improve our infrastructure to simplify things for our clients, deliver innovative products and services, and scale our business while effectively managing our base cost.", "So I'm optimistic, very optimistic about our prospects, but I'm also realistic about our challenges. We're still dealing with an unprecedented low interest rate environment, as is every bank. Our dynamic client base and our unique model have allowed us to deliver strong performance regardless of these rates, but low rates and competition have impacted our yields and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. These are challenges that we are well-equipped to handle as our performance have shown. So while we may not win every deal, we're winning most of the deals that matter to us. Those are the highest-quality companies, the best startups, the most influential VC and private equity partners, the ones we won, and our win rate has increased in the past year.", "In addition, there are significant barriers to entry for potential competitors. It's not easy to lend money to our clients but it can be done. What's more difficult is providing the kinds of expertise and educational events that solve their problems and make it easy for them to do business with us, or the introductions and connections to the investors and potential clients that help them take their business to the next level, or government relations effort that give startups a voice in policy matters affecting their success, this kind of value that has become our brand over the last few decades.", "We know that the more successful we are, the harder we have to stay to work ahead. So whether it's simplifying the opening of client accounts so it can done in minutes rather than days, or delivering loan documents on Christmas eve because a client needs them, our employees are constantly raising the bar and themselves to innovate and be the best partner to our clients. That attitude of doing whatever it takes to increase our clients' chances of success is a one thing that will never change and our clients are counting on it.", "Thank you, and now I'm going to turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg, and thank you all for joining us today.", "We are extremely pleased with our fourth quarter results. As you can see from our loan growth, we saw no slowdown in client activity due to fiscal cliff concerns and credit quality remained high. Core fee income grew solidly and we had strong gains on warrants and investment securities related to our venture capital investments. We continued to deliver outstanding performance despite interest rate pressures. Overall it was a strong end to a great year in which we performed very well against our initial outlook provided last January.", "There are six areas I want to highlight today. First is strong loan growth from normal client activity and from some -- excuse me. I'll start over for them.", "First is a strong loan growth both from normal client activity and from some yearend tax-motivated activity. Second is the strength of our deposit franchise which was reflected in growth in client funds, both on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet funds. Third is higher net interest income and a stable net interest margin. Fourth is excellent credit quality. Fifth is strong gains on investment securities related to investments and venture capital funds and VC-backed companies and on equity warrants. And of course I will talk about our outlook for 2013.", "Let me start with loan growth. We had an outstanding quarter. Average loans grew 4.6% or $367 million to $8.3 billion while period-end balances increased by 9.2% or $755 million to $8.9 billion. Those increases stem from strong growth in sponsor-led buyout loans in our software portfolio as well as venture capital and private equity capital call lines of credit.", "In addition, as I alluded to earlier, a portion of our fourth quarter growth was due to clients working to get certain deals completed by the end of the year in anticipation of tax changes. Given the huge run-up we had in the fourth quarter, we would expect the pace of average loan growth to moderate in the first quarter with Q1 period-end loans remaining flat to down.", "For the full year 2012, we grew average loans by $1.7 billion or 30%, exceeding our 2012 growth outlook of percentage growth in the high 20s, which we increased in the mid-20s in July. We grew period-end loans by $2 billion or 28% in 2012 to reach an all-time high of $8.9 billion. Growth throughout the year was primarily driven by sponsor-led buyouts and capital call lines of credit.", "Now let me turn to our deposit franchise, which showed extremely strong growth. Average total client funds grew by $1 billion in Q4 to $40.2 billion. This reflects on-balance-sheet deposits of $19 billion and off-balance-sheet funds of $21.2 billion. Period-end balances grew by 7% to $41.7 billion, reflecting deposits of $19.2 billion, an all-time high, and off-balance-sheet funds of $22.5 billion.", "Average deposits grew by 4% or $731 million as a result of strong acquisition of Accelerator in growth clients and strong activity by our private equity clients. On a period-end basis, deposits grew by 8% or $1.45 billion, further reflecting elevated yearend activity levels. For the full year 2012, we grew average deposits by $2.3 billion or 15%, which slightly exceeded our outlook of low-teens growth. Period-end deposits also grew by 15% or $2.5 billion. This growth was driven by our clients' continued health and by our solid pace of client acquisition.", "Off-balance-sheet client investment funds grew at a healthy pace during the fourth quarter, driven primarily by active client adoption of our suite product. Period-end suite balances crossed the $4 billion threshold, growing $681 million during the quarter and $3 billion since the fourth quarter of 2011. Average client investment funds grew in Q4 by $247 million or 1% and period-end balances grew by $1.45 billion or 7%. For the full year 2012, average client investment funds grew by $2.5 billion or 14% and period-end balances grew by a staggering $3.8 billion or 20%.", "Moving on to net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income grew by $6 million or 4% in the fourth quarter to $161 million as a result of growth in loan balances and lower premium amortization expense on our investment securities portfolio. For the full year 2012, net interest income grew by an impressive $92 million or 17%. This growth was within our outlook range of high-teens growth.", "Higher net interest income during the quarter was primarily driven by stellar loan growth, although loan yields were lower. Average loan yield during the quarter was 5.98% compared to 6.11% in the third quarter and 6.51% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease in loan yield during the fourth quarter was driven in part by the increasing proportion of our loans that are tied to the national prime rate of 3.25% versus existing loans tied to the SVB prime rate of 4%.", "Additionally, decreasing loan yields during 2012 were due to changes in the mix of our loans including significant growth in loans to larger companies which typically have higher credit quality than loans in other segments. For the full year 2012, average loan yield was 6.21% versus 6.7% in 2011. Lower amortization expense in our available-for-sale securities portfolio also contributed to higher interest income in the fourth quarter.", "The yield on the investment portfolio in the fourth quarter was 1.6%, an increase of 10 basis points compared to the third quarter and a decrease of 15 basis points from the same quarter in 2011. For the full year 2012, the yield on average investment securities was 1.66% versus 1.83% in 2011 due to lower reinvestment rates and higher premium amortization expense.", "Amortization expense in the fourth quarter was $13.1 million, a decrease of $4.2 million compared to the third quarter. The decrease was the result of a slight decline in actual prepayments on premium mortgage securities and a decline in estimates of future prepayments. Because prepayments on mortgage securities can track changes in interest rates, premium amortization expense will continue to be a factor impacting our interest income in 2013.", "As a result of these factors, our net interest margin remained relatively stable during the fourth quarter at 3.13% versus 3.12% in the third quarter.", "Net interest margin for the full year 2012 was 3.19%, well within our revised outlook range. You may recall when we started 2012, our net interest margin outlook was higher, between 3.2% and 3.3%, and we adjusted it downward as a result of significant deposit growth, declining loan yields, and increased premium amortization on investment securities. Despite these three things, we grew net interest margin by 11 basis points from 2011.", "Moving on to credit quality, it remains excellent, reflecting our continued strong underwriting and credit management, as well as the strength of the innovation sector. We had a provision for loan losses of $15 million compared to $6.8 million in the third quarter. The majority of that was tied to our strong period-end loan growth of $755 million, and the rest reflected low net charge-offs of $5.9 million or 28 basis points annualized.", "Gross loan charge-offs were $7.6 million, primarily from our hardware and life science portfolios. This compares to $4.6 million in the third quarter. For the full year 2012, net charge-off was 31 basis points of average total gross loans, which was at the low end of our outlook. Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans remained stable at 1.23% for the quarter and for the year, consistent with our outlook.", "Impaired loan balances decreased slightly to $38.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $39.4 million at the end of the third quarter and $36.6 million at the end of 2011. For the full year, non-performing loans were 42 basis points of total gross loans, well within our outlook.", "Moving on to non-interest income; it increased significantly in the fourth quarter to $127 million from -- sorry, from $69.1 million in the prior quarter, primarily as a result of higher gains on investment securities and warrants. Net of non-controlling interest, non-interest income was $75.6 million.", "We recognized net gains on investment securities of $68.2 million. Net of non-controlling interest, the gains were $17.2 million compared to $7.5 million in Q3. The big item there was exceptional significant unrealized gain on investment securities from our venture capital related investments.", "The primary driver for this gain was a valuation increase in one of our managed direct venture funds which resulted from a new funding [route] for one of the companies in that fund. The impact for us was greater than normal because in this particular fund we received a significant amount of carried interest in addition to the valuation gains. It is important to note that this was an unusually large gain for us and a relatively infrequent occurrence in our expense. It's important to note also that valuation gains are unrealized gains so it is possible we could see some fluctuation in the fair value of this investment and others in the coming quarters.", "Overall it was an outstanding quarter for our funds business, with additional gains in our debt funds and certain strategic investments.", "Moving on to warrants, we recorded net gains on warrants of $7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $500,000 in Q3. This increase was driven primarily by net valuation increases of $4.7 million and $2.4 million from warrant exercises.", "Looking at the rest of non-interest income, our core fee income increased by 7% or $2.5 million to $37 million, primarily due to letter of credit and foreign exchange fees. In addition to letters of credit and foreign exchange, core fee income includes fees from deposit services, client investments and credit cards. Our outlook on core fee income for 2012 was growth in the mid-teens, and we met that with growth of 16% or $18 million.", "To wrap up on our results, I'll just touch on some of the items I did not highlight, namely expenses and capital ratios. Expenses remained within our expectations, although we saw a bit of an uptick in the fourth quarter due primarily to performance related increases in incentive compensation tied to our overall performance.", "Non-interest expense was $143 million in the fourth quarter compared to $135 million in the third quarter. For the full year, our non-interest expense excluding non-controlling interest increased by 9% or $43 million to $535 million. This increase was within the high single-digit range we indicated in our outlook.", "Our non-GAAP operating efficiency ratio, which excludes non-controlling interest and certain other items, fell to 59.7% in the fourth quarter compared to 63% in the third quarter. For the full year, our non-GAAP efficiency ratio improved to 62.2% compared to 65.6% in 2011.", "Our capital ratios remained strong with some risk-based capital ratios dipping down slightly due to our exceptional loan growth in the fourth quarter. Bank tier 1 leverage increased by 5 basis points for the quarter to 7.05% due to earnings growth.", "Now I will move on to the full year 2013 outlook, starting with our assumptions. We assume that our clients' healthy pace of activity continues and that VC activity grows modestly. We further assume that we'll continue to execute effective on our efforts to win new clients domestically and around the globe. In terms of credit quality, we assume no significant deterioration of the economy. And finally, as well as unfortunately, we expect no changes in the Fed funds target rates.", "Please remember that these growth estimates are for the full year 2013 compared to the full year 2012. We expect average loans to grow at a percentage rate in the low 20s driven by our clients' continued healthy activity. We believe the strongest loan growth will come from our corporate finance clients and in particularly from buyout lending. We expect average deposits to grow at a percentage rate in the mid single digits due to continued client acquisition.", "We expect net interest income to increase at a percentage rate in the mid single digits due to continued loan growth but offset by downward pressure on loan yields related to our loan mix, use of the national prime rate versus SVB prime, continued competition, as well as downward pressure on investment yields. And we expect our net interest margin to be between 3.1% and 3.2%. This outlook is based on our outlook for interest rates, our changing mix of loans, including the gradual trend toward national prime as a benchmark, and our expectations for yields on mortgage securities.", "Turning to our credit quality outlook, the key drivers here will be the continued health of our clients and gradual improvement of the economy. We expect our allowance for loan losses for performing loans to be comparable to 2012 levels of 1.16%. We expect net loan charge-offs to be between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans or comparable to 2012 levels. And we expect non-performing loans as a percent of total gross loans to be similar to 2012 levels of 42 basis points.", "Our core fee income, as I defined it a few minutes ago, is expected to increase at a percentage rate in the mid teens. One of the key drivers is expected to be credit card income, which will benefit from improved penetration among our clients and enhanced card solutions. Another driver will be foreign exchange which will benefit from our UK expansion.", "And we expect non-interest expense, excluding expenses related to non-controlling interest, to increase at a percentage rate in the mid single digits. We expect this growth to stem from higher compensation costs related to an increase in our number of employees and higher operational costs related to ongoing IT and global operations infrastructure enhancements. We will also expect to see a seasonal increase in Q1 as has been evident over the last few years.", "In 2012 we continued to lay the groundwork for our growth strategy of winning and supporting clients at their critical early stages and keeping them as they grow. We have made tremendous gains in expanding our ranks of larger innovation companies and extending our platform globally. We are well-positioned to continue that work in 2013 and we believe that we're off to an excellent start in 2013 given our 2012 finish. And if we get help from interest rates, that will certainly help things even more.", "The innovation sector is alive and well, our pipeline looks good, our client relationships have never been better, and our people are the best in the business. For all these reasons, we are very positive about our prospects for 2013. Thank you. And now I'll ask the operator to open the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions].", "Your first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "I'll start. If I look at the change in interest income in the securities portfolio and make an adjustment for the change in premium amortization, it looks like, from a rate view, interest income on securities went down by only $1 million or so this quarter. Does that tell us that the headwind from the securities book is basically behind and in 2013 you should be able to invest cash somewhere close to the portfolio yield?", "Mike Descheneaux", "It's not too far off. I mean the premium amortization expense that we experienced in Q4 was obviously lower than Q3 as we pointed out. And our expectations going into 2013 is more or less at that, you know, similar level for each quarter as we experienced in Q4.", "But to answer your point more specifically, the reinvestment rates that we're kind of getting with new investments are around 140 to 150 basis points. So as you know, we finished the quarter at around 160 basis points of yield. So you're not out of the woods yet, a lot of it depends on the prepayment fees as well too, but it feels like a lot of the downward drag is out, but again it all comes back to that premium amortization expense. So, how goes repayments or prepayments, that's really going to dictate the 2013 year.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. And maybe for my one follow-up, City National discussed on their earnings call tonight that they're expanding more in technology and life sciences. Can you talk about the competitive environment and what do more banks expanding into your niche mean to you from a growth and particularly pricing perspective, looking at where your loan yields are?", "Greg Becker", "So, Steve, this is Greg. I'll start. Maybe Dave want to add to it. Yeah, we see more people entering the market. And I guess it's not surprising, mainly because it's one market. And we've said this for years, and we should expect to see this, that it's a high-growth market, it's performed well through multiple cycles, and again, it's one of the only fast-growth areas in the market. So that's not surprising.", "From our standpoint, knowing that this was the -- would be the case for years to come, for the foreseeable future, our focus is on making sure that we have the most diversified product set, can cover pretty much anything any of our clients need wherever they want, any geography, product service, etc. and then you work on the client service side and the value-add. So it's not just one thing, it's multiple things.", "That being said, is it going to be competitive? Absolutely. And again, all the things that we're doing to make sure that we're positioned well in the market either to win, add clients, that's what we do. We've been doing this longer than anybody else and we're definitely not complacent, is probably the short story.", "Dave Jones", "And Steve, this is Dave. So, yes, we have acknowledged that City National has been hiring in the marketplace and they will compete with us. It isn't clear exactly at what level. Are they going to be competing at the particularly early stage or are they going to be middle or later stage? I would guess more likely model or later stage, but that's strictly a guess.", "And I also will point out that an important part for us is to look at the value of the entire client relationship. And while it may be that competition forces us to think hard about the interest rate and the loan fee that we may charge, the important part is keeping the entire relationship, the benefit of existing and growing opportunities for non-credit revenue.", "Steven Alexopoulos \u2013 JPMorgan", "Okay. Appreciate all that color. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore Partners. Your line is open.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "On the margin, I just wanted to get a little bit of a color on your margin outlook, more specifically your loan yields appear to be holding up certainly better than we had expected. And I guess if you could just give us a little bit of color around the, you know, how that -- how you're supporting the yields there and how we should think about that going forward?", "Greg Becker", "Hey, John, I want to make sure. So the question is about loan margin specifically, right?", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Well, specifically the loan yields, I mean that's part of the margin story, you know, I'm just asking about the loan yields. It certainly seemed to be holding up better.", "Dave Jones", "So, John, this is Dave, and a big part of where we saw the growth in the fourth quarter was indicated to be in the sponsor-led buyout portfolio. And the yields that that particular product delivers is better than would be the case for a typical larger corporate transaction. So the compression that we would experience by growing with that particular product is less than probably you were expecting.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay, all right. And I guess on that point, could you give us a little more color on where -- what are the yields that you're getting, the new money yields by loan types? So, for that product and for your -- I guess, update us in the capital call line, etc.?", "Dave Jones", "So let me keep the response at a high level, some of the major categories. So, on the sponsor-led buyout, a typical transaction these days would be a LIBOR plus a spread of 450 to 475. That LIBOR would have a floor of 1% to maybe 1.25%. The capital call for venture capital private equity probably is going to be pretty close on average to the Wall Street prime of 3.25. The later-stage corporate borrower probably is going to be close maybe than -- slightly less than the Wall Street prime because it's probably going to be a LIBOR plus a spread, but that rate is going to be reflective of the larger, better credit quality that the client delivers. Otherwise, the early-stage business would be in the high single digits as a typical yield.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay --", "Mike Descheneaux", "So perhaps the only thing I would add on to that, John, just to be cognitive of the fact that it all depends on where the growth is going to come from, right? Because obviously if you have a heavy amount of growth than the buyout, that's obviously going to help it, but if you're growth is heavier on the private equity venture capital lines of credit which are downward on the prime, that's obviously going to be a little bit of a drag on the loan yield itself, albeit accretive to net interest income. So just be cognitive of the fact that the mix does heavily affect the overall loan yield.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Right. Okay, thanks, Mike. And then lastly, on the premium amortization, what is the amount of your unamortized premium in the bond portfolio as of the end of the year?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So it's approximately $115 million.", "John Pancari \u2013 Evercore Partners", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Josh Levin from Citibank. Your line is open.", "Josh Levin \u2013 Citibank", "Thank you. Good evening.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Josh.", "Josh Levin \u2013 Citibank", "My question is about the gains from non-market fund investments. You mentioned they're driven by valuation changes. I assume those investments are fairly illiquid. So what's the process for valuing them and what's -- what are the inputs you use?", "Mike Descheneaux", "You know, it's a host of metrics. Obviously, you know, it's probably nothing surprising to you, you're looking at comparables of other companies, you're looking at multiples of revenues and things. And so again it's probably nothing surprising there, any rocket science I would say. I don\u2019t know if you really want to go nano-specific thread or an area that might help you more.", "Josh Levin \u2013 Citibank", "That's good enough. I can follow up with Meghan later. Just a second question, how much of your loan growth guidance incorporates your international efforts?", "Greg Becker", "Josh, this is Greg. And it's still -- on a percentage basis, it's growing faster than the overall percentage growth rates. But again, as I described then, I described specifically just for the UK, roughly 3%, it's still a small absolute dollar amount. So, over time, as I said in my comments, you've got this smaller base but growing at a faster rate than you do the overall average, so over time it will be coming increasingly larger percentage of the overall portfolio.", "But what's interesting about the UK and other markets, because we have this early-stage to late-stage segmentation, we're winning clients at the early stage, we're winning clients at the mid stage, and we're also winning corporate finance and buyout clients as well. It's our strategy to stay with clients longer and work with larger companies still plays out in the markets like the UK, which is what I think we're going to see over time a decent amount of growth from.", "Josh Levin \u2013 Citibank", "Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Okay. Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "I guess first question kind of gets back to the competition and pricing subject. When -- have you, I guess this would affect mostly with your early-stage clients, but when pricing those sorts of credits, have you looked at all at whether or not using warrants as part of your pricing structure? Have you given up warrants on any deals, you know, recently, or is that still a key part of your pricing?", "Dave Jones", "Aaron, this is Dave. And we have seen competition give up on warrants and we have elected not to do that. Don't specifically, I don\u2019t specifically understand that strategy.", "Greg Becker", "The only thing I would add to that, part of it depends upon structure. So, some of the loan structure at the earlier stage, depending upon the flexibility of the structure, that's where warrants become a critical component of the overall return. There are certain circumstances where, you know, clients are willing to take a more conservative structure with loan covenants and things like that where maybe we wouldn't be willing to take warrants or require warrants in that scenario. So it does depend upon the structure, but if your point is, have we seen much change in how we underwrite and how we structure, the answer would be no.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay, that's helpful. And then with respect to pricing on your existing portfolio, the SVB prime versus the Wall Street prime, what percentage of loans currently in the book are still at SVB prime that haven't reverted or likely to in -- what happens there?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Aaron, this is Mike. I'm just [switching off] on memory here, but it's somewhere around that 20% number.", "Aaron Deer \u2013 Sandler O'Neill & Partners", "Okay, very good. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Joe.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "I guess a question on loan concentrations, probably for Dave. I was just curious, where did the sponsor-led buyout and capital call line portfolios end up as far as outstandings? And how big are you willing to get -- let them get as a percentage of total loans? And similarly, the large loans, over $20 million rose 20% sequentially and now 35% of the portfolio. How large are you comfortable with that getting as well?", "Dave Jones", "All right. So the concentration of software, software ended the quarter at roughly $3.3 billion and venture capital ended the quarter close to $1.7 billion.", "In terms of the buyout portfolio, did you say that you thought it was 30% of the portfolio?", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "No. I was just -- I was curious how big sponsor-led buyout was, but large loans, over $20 million -- yeah.", "Dave Jones", "I'm sorry. Yes, thanks. So the sponsor-led buyout portfolio ended the year a little bit over $1 billion. And in evaluating that, considering the type of structure that we put, the underwriting effort that we put, the niche that the individual loans would be situated in, we have plenty of growth opportunity still in the sponsor-led buyout space.", "In terms of the large loans, the loans over $20 million, looking at that, yes, it is at the 30% level and up quite a bit over the year. I look at the composition of it and I see that the software space and the venture capital private equity call lending space were the two largest components. What I am seeing in the software particularly is the contribution of the sponsor-led buyout. What we have said over the years is that a target hold position for us and a buyout would be $20 million to $25 million. So as we are growing that book of business, de facto each one of the new opportunities would then fall into this disclosure, and I am okay with that.", "What I saw with the venture capital for the fourth quarter was an unusually large amount of activity very late in the quarter. And my sense of it is, because it was large, because of the nature of those loans, and frankly what we have seen in the three weeks or so of the quarter is that the typical pattern of a capital call funding being funded for 10 to 20 days has played out and we've seen about as much erosion or decline in venture capital, capital call lending in the first quarter as we saw in the last 10 days, two weeks of the fourth quarter.", "So I don\u2019t think that the level of intra-capital activity for the fourth quarter is necessarily indicative of what I expect in the first quarter. And Mike made the comment in his presentation that first quarter loans could be flat or even slightly down. So the $250 million to $300 million growth in venture capital could not repeat for the first quarter. We will have growth in other areas but it will be hard if at all capable of making up for what could be decline in venture capital, and as we're saying, could be flat to slightly down in the first quarter. A little more information than you asked.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "No, that's particularly helpful, Dave. Thank you. The other question, for Mike I guess, is just curious if you've seen any impact from the new money market reform rules being talked about. Is there a chance you could see some of that money repatriate on the balance sheet?", "Mike Descheneaux", "You know, Joe, at this point we really haven't seen -- I mean, you look at our numbers here in the deposit and deposit franchise, it's, you know, everything is still the same. So, no real significant issues to report at the moment.", "Joe Morford \u2013 RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin from Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Brett Rabatin \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Brett.", "Brett Rabatin \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Wanted to ask kind of a similar question that I asked last quarter around just the early guidance for spread revenues, essentially the same as your formal guidance for '13, now the mid-single-digit growth number. And I guess I'm still kind of thinking about the dynamic or the dichotomy between balance sheet growth, the loan portfolio growing, loan yields coming down, but the margin now for guidance is kind of stable for the year. So I guess I'm just sort of struggling with why that number wouldn't be a little more -- a little higher kind of given what you're seeing in the loan growth side and probably some growth in the balance sheet with deposit flows coming still this year?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, Brett. Obviously there's two main drivers to this, obviously it's the loan yields and investment securities. I think that's clear to you as well. When you look at what's been happening to the loan yields over the last several quarters, obviously they've been coming down. And there's a variety of reasons why they're coming down. I mean, we did mention the fact that, moving from the -- our prime rate to the national prime rate. So you have 75 basis points of change on a certain segment of our loan population there that's under those headwinds as well. So that's one aspect of it.", "The other aspect is, when we're growing our loan portfolio, as Dave mentioned, some of the yields on some of these larger corporate finance clients, they're much less than let's say typical historical average of 6%, 6.5%, 7%, right? So, Dave was mentioning loans coming on it, you know, kind of the area of prime, around that area, right? So that's obviously going to be a drag on the loan yields. So the effect of what you have essentially is you're growing your volumes but the net interest income is going to be growing at that same steep path as it has been in the previous course because again the yields on these loans are much lower.", "So, obviously that's a big challenge, but nonetheless, it's part of our strategy. It's not unexpected because again we've always talked about our strategy going to -- dealing with some of the larger corporate finance clients. And the positive aspect of that is you end up with better credit quality, right, which is helpful, and no doubt that they tend to be larger consumers of fees and services. So, all in it, you know, we feel very comfortable as far as the holistic relationship. So that's -- I'll stop there for a second on that, the loan side, then I'm just going to shift to the investment securities, and Greg can jump on here in a moment, or Dave.", "So for the investment securities portfolio, again you've been seeing the pressures in the rates. I mean during Q2 or so, you saw the 10-year getting down to, say, 130, 135 basis points as well too. So that's been all over the map, and naturally we've been impacted pretty heavily by the premium amortization expense. And whilst it got better this quarter, again they're still elevated levels than they were, say, a year ago. So there continue to be that pressure on yields.", "And as you see, your opportunities to reinvest, I mean the reinvestment rates of securities that are maturing, I mean you're looking at 140 basis points when you're reinvesting. So again, continue to be a bit of downward pressure on that. Maybe not as much as it was, say, 18 months ago, but still quite a bit of pressure. And when you're looking at, you know, it may not sound that big, 10 basis points in investment securities coming down, but you've got to remember the fact that our investment securities portfolio is huge, right? It's $11 billion or so. And so when you're -- just a few basis points can have quite a lot of downward pressure on that interest income coming from investment securities.", "So I'll stop there and maybe if Dave or Greg has anything to add, we'll do that, but I'll let you kind of digest that many response to that.", "Brett Rabatin \u2013 Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka from K.B.W. Your line is open.", "Julianna Balicka \u2013 K.B.W.", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Afternoon.", "Julianna Balicka \u2013 K.B.W.", "I have actually kind of -- my question is kind of related to the topic that was just being discussed. When I look at your guidance and outlook for average deposits and loan growth, it looks like you're assuming twice as much in dollar amounts of loan growth as deposit growth. So, A, is that stemming from your expectations that the pace of investments by the VCs will slow and therefore the amount of deposits overall in your industry will be lower? Or is that because you are expecting a more robust growth of total client funds? So maybe you could talk a little bit about that particular aspect of it.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Julianna, this is Greg. Just a follow-up to what Mike said, you know, the part of that, the deposits, that's a driver of it. And deposits we don't expect to see a lot of growth. More of the client funds will grow, which implies it'll be more off our balance sheet, in the -- our off-balance-sheet vehicles. Now as we've seen in prior years, that's our expectation, but it's also something that's very difficult to predict. So to the extent that it happens the other way, meaning more of it comes on the balance sheet, obviously that puts more money into the investment securities portfolio, assuming loans are consistent with where we are predicting, and that obviously would drive a higher level of interest income.", "Now again, we're forecasting more of it to off-balance-sheet, but it's just one of the more difficult things to predict because what we're trying to do is obviously put our clients in the right product but obviously our clients are going to decide what they want to do. Bottom line is we do expect VC activity to still be good this coming year.", "So, total client funds growth we expect to see at a good pace. But again to my point, more of that will be directed off-balance-sheet.", "Julianna Balicka \u2013 K.B.W.", "Okay. And then --", "Mike Descheneaux", "I'll just -- maybe just add one -- just one other quick thing. It's really as Greg said, luck. Net interest income, if that happens where deposits are greater than we expected, net interest income will go up. But as you know, net interest margin would be negatively affected, which is okay, right? I mean because at least in these low interest rates environment, really the key is just to try to continue to grow your net interest income, you know, all things being equal. So, just to make sure you have that color.", "Julianna Balicka \u2013 K.B.W.", "Yes, right. So then the follow-up to that then is, since it's not a macro call on the VC activity but more of a balance sheet management approach, then the funding of your loan is going to come from the decline of the securities portfolio. So, can you refresh us how much of your securities portfolio cash flows each month and therefore how you -- how are you thinking about that in terms of your yields, meaning the maturing securities, you'll just reinvest them to loans, and therefore you'll, all things being equal, retain maybe higher price securities than what you would otherwise be reinvesting in, or?", "Mike Descheneaux", "I think in general you have it right. We have roughly about, each quarter, about $600 million or so that's maturing. And to your point, that is going to be used to support the loan growth as well. So, obviously you're going to get a bit of pick-up in the net interest income, it's also healthy for the net interest margin as well too, because if you take investment securities yielding 160 basis points and you put it into loans that are hopefully you're earning more than 3% or so and above, that's obviously going to be accretive to both net interest income and net interest margin.", "Julianna Balicka \u2013 K.B.W.", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Herman Chan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Herman Chan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Thanks. Just another question on deposits and the off-balance-sheet product. In terms of growing that off-balance-sheet product more in 2013, is that mostly going to be coming from new clients, or will you be transitioning existing clients into that product?", "Greg Becker", "Herman, this is Greg. And it's both. It's not one, really with both existing clients, we could have a client that ends up raising a large round of equity, and the client which we are in discussions with them, they may move more of that money off-balance-sheet. But obviously as we approach a new larger corporate client, maybe a public company, that may be much more that would be directed off-balance-sheet. So it depends upon what segment the client is in. It depends upon what's most important for that client. And we sit down with them and advise them what their options are based on what they're looking for.", "Herman Chan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. And Greg, you mentioned Latin America as a potential source for startups going forward. Keeping in mind the bank's growing international presence, what's your appetite to expand in these Latin American markets?", "Greg Becker", "So we are looking at other markets, but just to be clear here, our view into Latin America, let's say Brazil specifically, is much like some of the other foreign markets outside the UK and in China. It's more exploratory. If we were to look to do anything there, it would be truly over the long term. Right now what's happening with a lot of these countries, are startup venture-backed companies get formed in their holding companies outside of the local country.", "So let's take Brazil for an example. It gets formed outside of Brazil, in the US, or came as another entity. We can still bank that entity legally, and then they downstream money on an as-needed basis to their local relationship, local bank in those countries. So that's actually still a small piece. My point was just more that it's something we're paying attention to because over the long run we believe that Brazil and other markets are markets that we need to pay attention to. But short answer is don't expect us to be opening up there anytime soon.", "Herman Chan \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron. Your line is open.", "Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Afternoon.", "Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I realize this topic has been around for a little bit, but I've seen some press, I'm sure you have too, you know, relatively recently, you know, talking about the future of tax law in this country and whatnot, and specifically about the future that carry interest regime. I'm curious, you know, what your most recent thoughts are, you know, what kind of impact on the key industry, on your related business you might see, if that tax regime really does come to an end or gets altered significantly.", "Greg Becker", "Gaston, this is Greg. And I guess the short answer for this one is I don\u2019t think it's going to have a big impact. And the reason I said it is if you look at the overall venture capital activity, it's still a relative small number in the overall scheme of capital, so, $20 billion, $25 billion a year, which sounds like a lot of money, but if you look into overall capital flows, it's not as significant. If carried interest taxes were to increase, so it's a short-term tax rate, do I think it would have an impact?", "No -- I think modest at best. I'd say right now, clearly people are describing it as a pain, they don't want it, the venture capitalists, and that's the fight you're hearing about. But clearly, even if it happens, people are still going to want to be in this business, they're going to want to continue to invest in these companies, because there's still upside that can be had even if the tax rates are higher. So, bottom line, I don\u2019t expect to see a big impact.", "Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar", "Okay. And one last thing, very quickly, the global expansion, you just said how some of these markets are kind of more of a long-term approach. I'm curious, as you kind of roll out again over the long term in some of these markets, do you think JVs would be your preferred way of kind of expanding into those so you can manage the local risks better in markets where you may not have as much familiarity?", "Greg Becker", "You know, two things there, Gaston. One is it's too early to tell. As you know, we have the joint venture in China and --", "Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar", "Right.", "Greg Becker", "-- and it's too early to forecast how that plays out. And bottom line is I think every -- any country we would go into is going to be specific to what are the risks in profiles and opportunities with that specific country. So it's too difficult to make a general comment about what our approach would be in any given country.", "Gaston Ceron \u2013 Morningstar", "Good enough. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Thanks.", "So in closing, I just want to iterate how good we feel about the quarter and the year, not just from a numbers perspective but we accomplished a lot of really key milestones we think are very important to our long-term growth. We remain excited about the prospects, you heard that from my comments, Mike's comments and Dave's comments, assuming the economy and the markets remain stable. We're just in a market in this innovation economy that we really couldn't be more excited about and really are hanging our hats on.", "So we want to thank our clients for their trust in us and their support. We are going to be there to continue to support them. We want to thank our employees for really doing the heavy lifting to accomplish the things that we described. We get to describe it to all of you, but at the end of the day, they're the ones that are really driving it, and I think it's really important for everyone to acknowledge.", "So with that, looking forward to a great 2013, and thanks everybody.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I'll now hand the call over to our host, Ms. Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Dustin, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our second quarter 2013 earnings call. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our second quarter results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. I'd like to remind everyone that our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "I will caution you that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call and that actual results may differ materially. As usual, we encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call. In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation to GAAP measures can be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We plan to limit the length of the call, including Q&A, to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thank all of you for joining us today. SVB had another strong quarter. We delivered net income of $48.6 million and earnings per share of $1.06 compared to consensus estimates of $0.94 per share. These results reflect solid performance across the business and strong activity among our clients.", "A few highlights: We had outstanding loan growth, thanks to our success at winning larger corporate clients and our strong relationships with venture capital and private equity firms. Second quarter period-end loans grew by 9%, and average loans broke the $9 billion threshold. Average total client funds, which includes both deposits and off-balance sheet funds grew by $540 million or 1.3% for the quarter, which shows liquidity growth of our clients, as well as our success with new client acquisitions. Although average deposits were down for the second quarter in a row, off-balance sheet funds posted nice growth, led by our off-balance suite fund. We had healthy gains on VC investments and warrants, thanks to relatively robust exit markets and valuation increases, as well as our continued emphasis on working with the best and most promising innovation companies. And credit quality remained strong overall.", "We are very pleased with our performance this quarter and with the year so far. The health of our client markets has been a key driver of our results and clients continued to do well. The VC-backed exit market appears to be enjoying a long-awaited pickup as well. There were more than twice as many of VC-backed IPOs in the second quarter as in the first with the strongest showing for biotech since 2000.", "Of 21 venture-backed IPOs in the second quarter, 57% were SVB clients, another indication that we're banking the best and the brightest. The number of VC-backed M&A deals remain steady in the second quarter, while we saw an encouraging increase in average deal values. The level of venture capital invested picked up during the quarter as well. Although year-to-date, it's roughly on par with 2012.", "The recent trend toward more capital-efficient business models and smaller investments has helped new company formation by creating opportunities for new kinds of investors. Innovation capital is becoming much more widely available from non-VC investors, including corporates, angels and specialized seed funds. And that's good for our business.", "From our perspective, new company formation remains very healthy, and we are banking new startups at a record pace. We added 318 new early-stage clients in the second quarter, a 30% increase over the same period last year. And for the first half of the year, we're at 550 new early-stage clients, nearly double the number for all of 2010.", "These early-stage client volumes are key component of our long-term pipeline. The pace of business for our more established clients remain strong as well, with activity among our larger corporate finance clients driving the bulk of average loan growth during the quarter. These clients contribute to healthy volumes in our core, fee-based products, which increased by 10% in the second quarter over the same quarter last year.", "The continued expansion of our products and services is an important part of our long-term strategy to be the bank of choice for innovation companies of all sizes worldwide. Today, we have a complete set of solutions for high-performance companies.", "On the loan side, these run the gamut from traditional working capital loans and acquisition financing to specialized and custom products, such as mezzanine debt, founder liquidity solutions and private banking.", "On the noninterest income side, we're enhancing our payment systems to make it easier for our clients do business with us and with their vendors and customers. For example, we're helping our clients who still use paper checks to move to more efficient card-based accounts payable systems. Near term, we're in production with our transAct Gateway, a platform to allow U.S. clients to fully automate their accounts payable processing with SVB. And we plan to go into production in third quarter with a mobile deposit platform. Our goal with these enhancements, with new products and with our global expansion is to be the only bank VCs, PE firms and entrepreneurs will ever need anywhere in the world.", "Our long-time commitment and focus in innovation space is a tremendous competitive advantage in this effort. We have global name recognition and a stellar track record in technology, life sciences and venture capital. Moreover, the knowledge, experience and relationships we built over 30 years are more meaningful differentiators in a market that is increasingly appealing to traditional bank competitors. That competition and its impact on pricing is a challenge. Interest rates are another challenge. And although we're pleased to see the markets drive up long-term rates and asset-sensitive stocks in June, our asset sensitivity is really tied to short-term rates. The good news is the market seems to think a short-term rate increase could happen sooner than originally expected. In the meantime, despite increased competition and pricing pressure, we are working hard to win and keep the best and most promising companies as clients.", "Overall, I remain excited about our growth prospects. And our clients, by virtue of being in the innovation space, are creating new opportunities, new companies, products and industries everyday. We have built a very strong market position and are well positioned for continued strong performance, assuming the economy doesn't deteriorate. We believe we're on track with our long-term strategy of bringing clients in early and keeping them as they mature, providing one-stop shopping for VCs, PE firms and entrepreneurs, doing what we do globally and maintaining our focus on the client, which is the most important thing.", "In closing, I'd like to share some recent feedback that I received from a spouse of a client of ours. Recently, we hosted a multi-day event with 75 venture capital and private equity financial executives. In one of the dinners, our clients husband came up to me and thanked me. He told me that after the firm switched to Silicon Valley Bank, her job became so much simpler, more streamlined and just easier that she's able to more -- spend more time with their family, and he attributed that to SVB.", "One of our goals is making it easier for our clients to do business with us. And I can't think of a better example of what success looks like than that. Such success is really a testament to the dedication of our employees, who are the ones taking care of our clients and helping them reach their goals. Their commitment sets us apart and ensures we keep innovating to help our clients succeed.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn it over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. We are very pleased with our performance in the second quarter, which was marked by continued loan growth and higher net interest income, as well as strong gains on investment securities and warrants. There are 6 things I will highlight in my comments: first, outstanding loan growth and continued high credit quality; second, higher net interest income and an increased net interest margin; third, growth in total client funds despite a decline in deposits; fourth, strong gains from our VC-related investments and equity warrants; fifth, lower expenses as we expected; and sixth, continued strong capital ratios. Before moving on, I do want to point out that we are maintaining our overall 2013 outlook, although we have increased our net interest margin guidance and slightly decreased our expectations for core fee income.", "Let us start with loan growth. Average loans reached another all-time high, increasing by $341 million or 3.9% to reach the $9 billion mark for the first time in our history. This increase reflects healthy demand among our growth stage and private equity clients. We also saw very strong runup at the end of the quarter in our private equity capital call loans, which helped drive up period-end loans by $777 million to $9.6 billion. Given the short-term nature of capital call loans, we would expect many of the capital call loans to be repaid quickly, which could result in relatively flat period-end balances in the third quarter. Nevertheless, we are on track to meet our full year average loan guidance, and our pipeline remains healthy.", "Looking at the longer term, we expect our loan growth to outpace that of the broader industry, although as our portfolio increases in size, the percentage growth rate will likely trend lower.", "Turning to credit quality. Credit quality remained strong, and our underlying metrics were solid. Our provision for loan losses was $18.6 million in the second quarter, of which approximately $9 million was due to strong period-end loan growth. This compares to a provision of $5.8 million in the first quarter. Net charge-offs in the second quarter were $11.2 million or 49 basis points annualized. This reflects gross charge-offs of $15.4 million. Net charge-offs also reflected exceptionally strong recoveries of $4.2 million, primarily from a single loan. Net charge-offs in the first quarter were $4.3 million or 20 basis points.", "Our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans was 1.23% versus 1.26% in the first quarter. Second quarter nonperforming loans were $41.2 million, or 42 basis points of total gross loans, a decrease of $3.2 million from the first quarter. Classified loans remained consistent with Q1. As you can see, we continue to maintain high credit quality, and we remain confident in our credit outlook for 2013 assuming that the economy does not deteriorate.", "Now let me turn to net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income was $170.1 million, an increase of $6.9 million or 4.2% over the prior quarter. This increase was driven by strong average loan growth and higher overall loan fees, primarily prepayment fees. We were also helped by lower premium amortization expense in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. These increases were offset somewhat by lower interest income from our AFS portfolio due to declining average balances, which were impacted by our use of portfolio maturities to fund our loan growth.", "Turning to net interest margin. Our net interest margin increased by 15 basis points to 3.4% in the second quarter. This increase was due to 3 factors: first, a favorable change in interest-earning asset mix, primarily as a result of loan growth; second, lower premium amortization on our available-for-sale securities portfolio due to a rise in long-term rates during the quarter; and finally, higher loan prepayment fees. VCs also drove the increase in overall yield on the loan portfolio by 8 basis points to 5.86% in spite of lower yields on loans before fees.", "As a result of the second quarter improvements to our net interest margin, we have raised our 2013 net interest margin outlook range by 10 basis points. While keeping in mind that net interest margin will be affected by deposit growth and premium amortization, we now expect net interest margin for the full year to be between 3.25% and 3.35%.", "Now let's look at total client funds. Average total client funds, that is the sum of our on-balance sheet deposits and our off-balance sheet client investment funds, increased by $540 million or 1.3% to $41.8 billion. This increase reflects higher average off-balance sheet funds offset by a decline in average deposit balances. Average client investment funds increased by $711 million to $23.2 billion. This change was largely driven by $573 million or a 14% increase in our off-balance sheet suite product.", "Average deposit balances decreased by $171 million to $18.6 billion, primarily due to lower noninterest-bearing deposits. With respect to period-end balances, we saw an increase in off-balance sheet funds and a decrease in deposits. However, we have seen a rebound this month in deposit levels. And while it is still early in the quarter, we are off to a good start in Q3.", "Now let us move on to noninterest income. Noninterest income net of noncontrolling interest was $67.4 million in the second quarter compared to $56.1 million in the first quarter. Please note that this is a non-GAAP number. The increase was driven by gains on investment securities and equity warrants. Gains on investment securities net of noncontrolling interest were $9.5 million compared to $5.1 million in the first quarter. These gains were primarily related to valuation increases in our fund of funds. Gains on equity warrants were $7.2 million, compared to $3.5 million in the first quarter. Most of these gains were due to increases in warrant valuations as a result of funding round-up dates.", "Now let us turn to core fee income, that is fees and foreign exchange, deposit service charges, credit cards, client investments and letters of credit. As Greg indicated, although quarterly core fee income increased by $3.2 million or 10% year-over-year, it was flat in Q2 at $36.5 million compared to the prior quarter due to lower volumes from foreign exchange and a challenging fee environment for our client investment funds.", "Accordingly, we are adjusting our full year outlook range for core fee income from the low teens to the low double digits. However, it is important to keep in mind that the dollar figures driving this change are relatively small, and we remain optimistic about the longer-term growth prospects of our core fee income.", "Now I will move on to expenses. Noninterest expense was $143.3 million in the second quarter, a decrease of $5.7 million or 4% from the first quarter. This decrease was driven primarily by lower compensation and benefits expense following a seasonal spike in Q1. The decrease was offset somewhat by a high incentive compensation, which is a significant variable in our expenses since it is determined by our performance relative to that of our peer group and our internal goals.", "Moving onto capital. Our capital position is strong and is further supported by our consistent earnings growth and solid credit performance. Our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio increased by 31 basis points primarily due to earnings growth and to a lesser extent, to lower average assets.", "Our bank level of tangible common equity to risk-weighted assets ratio decreased by 127 basis points to 11.18%. The key driver of the decrease was a significant increase in risk-weighted assets, driven by period-end loan growth. Additionally, decline was affected by a decrease in other comprehensive income from the impact of long-term market rates on our AFS portfolio. As a side note, the duration on our AFS investment portfolio was 2.7 years at the end of the second quarter compared to 2.4 years at the end of the first quarter. This increase reflects the impact of recent increases in market rates.", "In closing, we feel good about our performance in the second quarter. In almost every respect, we are on track to meet our expectations and our outlook for 2013. Our clients continue to do well, and there are signs of modest improvements in the overall economy. The interest rate environment remains a challenge, and although we have seen a slight benefit from movements in long-term rates, increases in short-term rates will benefit us significantly. Irrespective of this and when rates improve, we continue to focus on things in our control. We have meaningful near-term growth opportunities. We remain well capitalized and highly liquid with outstanding asset quality. We have talented and motivated employees and the best, most dynamic clients of any bank. Together, these advantages enable us to deal with the current market challenges and drive our long-term growth.", "Thank you, and now we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe I'll start on the securities book. It doesn't look like you added to balances this quarter just given what loan and deposits did. I'm curious if those capital call balances come back in the quarter. Maybe for Mike, what's the reinvestment opportunity in terms of yield on your securities given what the curve has done?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So Steve, you are right. We didn't really add to our loan portfolio in the given quarter. And if we do happen to have surplus, at least, our view on the surplus deposits or cash to invest, I mean, we're essentially going to approach or take the same approach with our investment portfolio as we had in the past. But again, you're not going to really see anything significant of growth this year just even if we do get to reinvest it. But if we were reinvesting, it would probably be somewhere in around to 225 to 250 basis points is probably what we would end up reinvesting on. It just depends on what securities we choose.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And just -- could -- I wanted some color on the U.K. business, maybe the balance of the loans, how it changed versus 1Q. And can you talk about what's essentially that makeup of the loan portfolio at this stage? Is it capital call lines, software acquisition loans?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Steve. This is Greg, and I'll talk about that. We have about a little more than 300 corporate accounts opened up so far in the U.K. branch and about a little more than 1/3 of those are U.S. clients that are doing business in the U.K., and so we're setting up operations for them with the balance being local companies in the U.K.. I guess, first and foremost, we feel very good about where we are. It's ahead of our expectations. From a loan perspective, I think, the last quarter, we said it was around 400. It was a -- actually, a little bit less than 400, and right now, we're kind of a little bit higher than that, but it's in that range. It's made up of a combination of you take our portfolio in the United States, and you just mirror that against the U.K.. It's pretty close. When you look at growth stage company versus corporate finance, buyout and including capital call facilities, quite honestly, that's what excites us about it. We're not doing new things or different things there. We're consistently taking the profile of our clients in the United States and doing the same thing for them in the U.K.. So feel very good about where we are. We're optimistic about the outlook for the balance of this year and look forward to healthy growth that could be as much as 50% year-over-year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess first question for Mike, if you could clarify the guidance on the margin a little bit? Seeing as if you just kind of held flat here at 3.40% through year end, we'd be slightly ahead of the full year range. Is that because some of the loan prepayment fees booked in the second quarter may not be repeated? Or is there some noise with premium amortization or price competition? What can you say about that?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Again, Joe, yes, you kind of answered your question yourself, but certainly, the loan prepayments, again, were a bit elevated in the quarter, so that was certainly affected and the same thing on the premium amortization. But other factor perhaps to consider as well, too, is where are we coming out on the deposit growth as well, too. If we're coming on the lower end of the range of the deposit guidance, then we'll certainly perhaps hold back or -- sorry, would help improve the net interest margin as well too. So there are those factors to consider.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, it's only because it may be the last chance I get to ask Dave a question. I wondered if he's there, if he could provide some...", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "He's here. He's here.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, good. Maybe, David, you can provide some details on the increase in gross charge-offs this quarter and also just the outlook -- or the pipeline for additional recoveries.", "David A. Jones", "So thanks, Joe. I will take the last opportunity. The charge-offs in the quarter were the result of several bonds and the several cases of working through some lesser quality assets. You see that with the decrease in the nonperforming loans in the quarter. So -- still, mostly early-stage companies has been virtually a 15-year track record today. And on the recovery side, what we're very proud of what was accomplished in the second quarter with the $4.2 million of recoveries. I only wish that I can leave Marc with an opportunity to recover as much, but realistically, it's not there. So there are several small opportunities, and our recoveries for the foreseeable future probably will reflect what you had seen over 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 much more so than what you saw in second quarter of 2013.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka with KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of questions, one, to kind of follow up on the question began by Joe on the charge-offs. Dave, you said that the current -- the chart of this quarter kind of came from a pace of workouts that had been kind of building it seems like over several months to resolve NPAs. So kind of looking forward, is there more of -- I mean is that something that's finished out at this point? Or is this kind of an ongoing process and there may be a couple of more quarters of little bit higher charge-offs before the drop back down?", "David A. Jones", "So I am thinking that, in any given year, there could be one quarter that kind of stands out over the others. We had 1 quarter in 2012 and the second quarter of 2013 could well be that 1 quarter and appreciate also that in that 1 quarter, we're talking about a 50-basis-point annualized level of net charge-offs. So we have, otherwise, provided guidance that net charge-offs would range from 30 basis points to 50 basis points over an annual period. The idea that we could have net charge-offs at 20 basis points in the first quarter, as was the case, and 50 basis points annualized in the second quarter, feels fine. And I'm thinking that if the economy holds, that there's good reason to think that the foreseeable future would hold net charge-offs that might be bracketed by the first 2 quarters' performance.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that makes sense. And then on the AOCI decline this quarter, any thoughts on -- any changes or any thoughts on the security portfolio margin going forward in terms of future AOCI decrease or in general? Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "We've been gearing our securities portfolio to a relatively, what I would call, sensible shorter-term duration, right, in expectations of some of these rate moves. And our portfolio is fairly well seasoned, so if rates do continue to go up, we really don't see -- if you're getting into duration extension, we really don't see it extending out too much further. I mean, we are at 2.7 years here currently. And again, we see it perhaps -- probably we're quite comfortable to be going up in 3, 3.5 years as well, too. But we really don't see it extending out too much further.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jennifer Demba with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "My questions really have been covered, but I'm curious if you can give us just an overall data on the progress of your private banking effort over the last 6, 9 months and how it's going according to plan and where you see it going maybe the next couple of years?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Jennifer. This is Greg. And I will -- I'll give you my perspective. My insight to the private bank is, first of all, very focused. That's kind of the most important point. We're working with our venture capital, private equity firms and the individuals that are part of those firms, plus increasingly, the CEOs of our high-performing companies. And again, the strategy is to really be very targeted, and I think that's our value proposition, is when your whole product set is designed around very specific individuals, you can really hopefully add a lot more value and customize to them. So our view is progress is going well. We had -- saw nice growth this last quarter in the private banking loan portfolio. But again, it's going to pace itself at a pretty consistent level compared to the rest of the loan portfolio growth, so you shouldn't see it grow, quite honestly, a lot faster or a lot slower than the rest of the loan portfolio. But it's on track. We feel good about it. And the feedback we're getting from clients, most importantly, has been exceptionally positive.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I was hoping -- in terms of your growth in the larger client segment, can you just talk about how much of that came from acquisitions or buyout activity versus other type of, let's call it, more traditional C&I lending in the tech space?", "David A. Jones", "Yes, and this is Dave. So the majority of that growth would have come from acquisition financing, Ken, and it is simply because when we book $20 million, $25 million, $30 million for an acquisition financing, we're going to enjoy that, say, $25 million for the entire next 90 days versus when it's a working capital type financing, it could be out for 15 days or 45 days. So what we saw in the second quarter was the expansion of average loans primarily from acquisitions that were largely booked in the first quarter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "I wonder if you can give us a little more color on your loan growth outlook. Your low-20s range for the year-over-year seems a bit conservative, I guess, because it implies flat balances, obviously, for next quarter, which you've already mentioned but also for the fourth quarter, it implies flattish as well by my math. So just wanted to see if you can give a little bit more color there, if you think you could be on the conservative side?", "David A. Jones", "John, this is Dave. And -- so one of the things that you would say following us for as long as you have is that we have average loan growth that tends to be below the period ends. So it is not unusual for the average for the following quarter to be anywhere from, say, 3% to 5% below the period-end balance of the prior quarter. So when you think about average, we had a little over $9 billion of average in the second quarter. That average, if we were to continue it for third and fourth quarter, meaning that if we'd had had the last 3 quarters, for example, less $9 billion, we wouldn't get to that low 20s. We're going to need to see that we have a loan growth in the third quarter and fourth quarter, not as significant, obviously, as the second quarter, but we'll need to continue to see loan growth in the third and fourth quarter to get to that low 20s. So I would like to exceed the expectation knowing that there will be quality in the business generated. But I'd also acknowledge that given the competitive environments that it would be unwise for me to bestow on people that will follow me an expectation that it is conservative. I don't believe it is. I think that Marc and others are going to have to work hard to get to that low 20s.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "That makes sense. On the deposit side, can you give us a little more detail on the decline in the deposits in the quarter? What you're seeing -- are you seeing any change in deposit behavior? Or is it just a shift towards the off-balance sheet? And then a little bit on the outlook on the deposit side as well.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, John. This is Greg. I'll start with it, and Mike may want to add to it. We did see just really a modest decline in deposits during the quarter on an average basis. And again, we really try to stress that our focus is on total client funds, which grew about $575 million, $580 million during the quarter. And so from our standpoint, it kind of fits with what we've been talking about for a while, which is from a capital ratio perspective, we're fine with directing more of the balances, excess balances off the balance sheet. And that's what we saw this quarter. As far as the outlook goes, we've kind of described what the outlook is in our -- in the guidance. But how we see that playing out is we think deposits will stabilize where they are, possibly grow, but we expect to see total client funds see -- continue to see nice growth the balance of the year. And that's a function of both winning higher wallet share of our existing clients and new client acquisitions.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin with Sterne Agee.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask about just the loan portfolio. I noticed, thinking about the linked quarter perspective, the variable percentage increased and from a 10-Q disclosure perspective, you guys probably have the highest asset sensitivity to a 200-basis-point parallel shift in the yield curve. What if rates just don't quite do the parallel shift and do what we've been seeing, which is the short end takes longer than the longer end to move higher? Can you give us some thoughts on kind of both how your variable loan portfolio has changed and maybe thinking about NII, if the yield curve shift isn't parallel as you guys kind of use in your analysis?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So if I understand that question, I think what you're trying to drive at is where do we believe long-term -- or loan yields are going to head if the rates stay the same. Is that what you're trying to drive at?", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Well, just thinking about your loan portfolio yield. I guess, first, probably the easiest thing to do would just be to kind of break out the prime versus LIBOR based and then just kind of think about how you see your loan portfolio yields rising as rates do rise, whether it be the short end or the long end.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Well, I think I'll start off, and then Dave can chime in here. But the one thing to put in perspective is there is that tendency that most of the loans we're issuing today are variable-based loans. And particularly as we get to some of these larger corporate clients, most of the loans that we're doing with them are LIBOR-based type of loan. So again, we've continued to issue the variable-based loans here. Now additionally, a lot of our growth is also coming from the cap call lines of credit, which tend to be based on national prime rate as well, too. So a lot of it just depends on the mix on where we go from here. But again, I think you're going to continue see the growth areas come from those corporate finance and the private equity and the associated rates with that. So I mean, we'll start with that and then maybe you have the follow-up question on that.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Well, I guess, I'm just trying to think about that you're pricing more of your loans off of LIBOR and if LIBOR is not moving quite as fast, and maybe prime is maybe at the longer end of the curve from a treasury perspective is -- I mean, as you think about your loan portfolio yield in the next year or so, I mean, I assume you're kind of thinking about that rate continuing to move and decline with competition. But I don't if you want to provide any additional thought on that.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So a lot of it will depend, again, on the mix and where we're going to come from. So if, for example, if we had some buyout loans, those would tend to hold the yields up and you have less deterioration in value. If the growth is going to continue to come from private equity cap call lines, when that's based on a national primary, that's certainly going to try to bring it down on the overall yield as well. So again, a lot of it, Brett, just depends on where that mix is going to come from. So I mean, you're going to continue to see a bit of pressure on the yields coming down in general, but again, going back to our strategy, our strategy about going to the larger corporate finance is not just about the loan interest income. It's also about the fee income that comes associated with it.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That's good color. And maybe the other thing I was just hoping to get a little clarification on is just you were just talking about the client adds and the total deposits in the quarter. Could you talk about maybe, as rates do go higher, your thoughts on bringing some of the off-balance sheet back on-balance sheet or how you think about kind of funding growth as rates do move higher?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, Brett. This is Greg. And as we're going through that process right now, and unfortunately, I guess, we haven't had to think about it a whole much -- a whole lot since the rates have been -- continue to be pushed out. But clearly, what our strategy is, is to build a product set that is going to allow us to continue to fund loan growth when rates start to pick back up, and one of the risks that we have is you start to see with our very low noninterest-bearing deposits is that more of that money starts to chase, either interest-bearing accounts are moving off-balance sheet to get yield, although we still think we're going to end up with a higher balance than a lot of our institutions with noninterest bearing, we're going to have to look at what we're going to be paying for our on-balance sheet money market accounts and make sure that we have the right, I'll you call it, toggles or switches to make sure that we can keep funding our loan growth. So we're looking at it, and clearly, the margin will pick up greater with the increase in rates. But we'll see some compression, but I guess, we'll just have to pay a little bit for the deposits that our on-balance sheet.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Perhaps the only thing I would add to it is just on the maturities on the investment securities portfolio, the capabilities of using the maturities to fund our loan growth. And currently right now, we have about a little bit over $600 million a quarter that's maturing from investment security portfolio, which is -- certainly has been adequate enough to fund the loan growth that we've because that's quite a large number on an annual basis as well, too. So even just with those maturities, that is quite healthy amount to help fund loan growth coupled with any -- even if it's a very modest growth in deposits on the balance sheet. So again, for the foreseeable future, we feel very good about the funding of the loan growth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Herman Chan with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Herman Chan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "My question's on fee income. You've seen core fee income flattish for a couple of quarters now. Given the growth in the larger corporate finance clients, I would assume fee income would trend higher. Can you provide some color on the decline in your fee income outlook and what you're seeing specifically in foreign exchange activity?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So Herman, I will start, and Mike may want to add some color to it. So we have seen volumes last quarter were up. This is in Q1, and in Q2, they actually declined a little bit. And when you look at volumes and you look at margins, they were, quite honestly, just a little bit sluggish in both quarters. Now that being said, we still look at the outlook, and that is driven by the new client acquisition, the number of corporate finance clients and even with the competitive pressure, we still expect it to grow. So the last 2 quarters, it was a little flat, but I guess, right now, we're not worried about it. We're still optimistic about the outlook. That's one aspect. The second aspect is the card income and that's our overall credit card fees, and those volumes have continued to increase at a very rapid rate over the last 12 months, actually, the last couple of years. And the outlook that we have for that basically is the new products we're bringing in the market, with the up cycle or uptick we're going some more clients and these new products is actually very positive. So we're positive about the outlook, and I'd say, we should expect to see nice growth, especially in credit cards.", "Herman Chan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Understood. And on the fund investment gains, are we at a stage in the investment cycle that we should expect an elevated level of fund gains going forward? How are you thinking about that particular item there?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "That's a very, very tough question, and a lot of it, obviously, depends on the environment that we're operating in. If there's a healthy amount of M&A activity, that's very conducive to upside gain, if the IPO activity's very healthy or the valuations on the stock market. So again, it was a nice surprise this quarter. It's certainly, a little bit more than we anticipated, but we certainly do expect to have some decent gains going forward, again, as long as the economy holds true.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron with Morningstar Equity.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I just had a question about what we can improve from the bank's performance -- from the company's performance as hopefully, the economy continues to improve and your margin hopefully expands. What's the lever -- what's -- how should we be thinking about the level of operating leverage in the business model? I mean, what can we kind of expect, you think again as the economy improves, your margin expands and hopefully an increasing percentage of net revenue falls to the bottom line?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I'll start off here first. I mean, without a doubt, I mean, interest rate is going to be one of the key drivers to improve the leverage ratios. But as we said, we can't wait around for the interest rates to come back. I mean, we think they will come back, but nonetheless, it's starting focus on things within our control. And so when you start thinking about our operating structure and things that we're doing, we've talked about -- I mean, we recently set up an operation center in Tempe, Arizona, which, again, is very conducive to our model to help us scale and certainly, more attractive on a cost basis as well, too, again focusing more on the fee income as well to try and grow those as well to kind of offset any challenges that we may have on the interest rates. And some of those things that are -- -- we're looking at the way we do -- way we operate our model. So again, it's very -- top of mind for us is trying to manage that efficiency ratio.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And then lastly on a different kind of leverage question, I mean, again, kind of looking at longer term, I mean, what's a good way to kind of think about how you approach just overall leverage? Whether it's TA to -- TE to TA or assets to equity or what not? I mean what -- Or TCE to TA? What sort of a good way that kind of we're thinking about what the bank wants to be sort of over the longer term?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "We haven't come out with any guidance on that. One of the things we have and if you're talking about leverage ratio, the Tier 1 leverage ratio, again, that is something we've been trying to drive up. And if we're talking about the bank level, that's certainly something we've -- say, look, we'd like to see it go above 7%. And in fact, we're actually already there, and you saw a nice improvement in that ratio this quarter as well, too. So given the quality of our equity stack and given the market environments around it, we feel very, very comfortable with where we're at, above that 7%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson.", "Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "I think my questions have largely been answered. Just curious on the provision build in the quarter. Can you talk about the amount of reserve that you sort of allocate to new capital call line drawdowns as opposed to other parts of the portfolio? Is it a lower provision build, relative to those lines?", "David A. Jones", "Yes. This is Dave. The answer is yes. Our allowance methodology does take the individual niches and the loss experience we have recognized from the niches in determination of our ultimate recommendation. I don't want to get too far end to weeds to describe that, but specifically, for private equity and venture capital call facilities, the required reserve is a little bit less than the 113 basis points. That is, the generic allocation for performing loans.", "Gary P. Tenner - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division", "Okay, so presuming that period-end balances in the third quarter are flat as you suggested could happen, but the mix is a little bit different. There would still be some amount of reserve build out less so than what was driven by the growth this quarter. Is that fair?", "David A. Jones", "So if loan balances were flat across the board, then all other things equal, we could expect to have an allocation of 113 basis points again, and presumably then the recommendation for the provision would largely be associated with the net charge-off.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Casey Haire with Jefferies.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "A question on SVB prime, just how much of the loan book is still go on SVB prime? How much of a drag was it on the margin? And at what point is SVB prime sort of fully migrated to national prime?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "We're pretty much eliminating most of that in our portfolio. It's come down significantly over the last several quarters, and I can't really think off the top of my head, but I think it's probably somewhere around 10% is what I'm thinking, 10% to 15%, but it continues to come down as we migrate over the national prime rate.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then just thinking longer term, I know you guys have a deeper penetration of the later-stage client base, which obviously comes with a lower loan yield. I'm just curious how -- what's the mix -- what's the composition of that later-stage client base today versus, say, 2006 when last time that, that was at a higher rate policy?", "David A. Jones", "So this is Dave. The later-stage business would be in the ballpark of, say, $2.25 billion. So it is, call it, about 25% of our business. And if you wanted to go back as far as 2006, then I would obviously have to be working off the top of my head in saying that, but I would say comfortably, it was substantially lower as a percent of our business in 2006 than it is today.", "Operator", "And we seem to have no further questions at this time, I'll now hand the call back over to management for closing remarks.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great. Thanks, so just to summarize, we had a great quarter. We had strong loan growth and great client acquisition. The gains on securities and warrants were a nice positive uptick as well. So overall, good. I guess, what I'm more excited about is the outlook, and not only what we're building from new products and solution set but what we're doing globally and how we're supporting our later-stage clients. So we feel good about the outlook and are looking forward to many years to come.", "So -- and I also want to thank our clients for their trust in us and our employees for their commitment. And I guess, most importantly, right now, when I give a big shoutout to Dave Jones for 16 years of doing a fantastic job as our Chief Credit Officer, and during that time period, we've been through a couple of big ups and downs, and Dave has been a great supporter of strong loan credit quality, as well as great loan growth over that time period. I know Marc's going to do a fantastic job, but I just want to thank Dave and thank everyone on the phone. So have a great day.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions]", "Thank you. I'll now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Laurel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our third quarter 2013 earnings call.", "Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our third quarter results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "I'd like to remind everyone that our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "I will caution you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call and that actual results may differ materially. As usual, we encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call. In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures.

[Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thank you, everyone for joining us today. This month, Silicon Valley Bank celebrated its 30th anniversary as the bank for the global innovation economy. Looking back in all the choices we've made in those 30 years, the decision to focus on innovation companies was the most important. This quarter perfectly illustrates the power of that focus. It was a great quarter. We delivered net income of $68 million or earnings per share of $1.46. Highlights of the quarter included: average loan growth of $524 million or 23% annualized, primarily from our corporate finance and private equity clients; we had tremendous growth in average total client funds of $2.7 billion, which grew to 45 -- $44.5 billion due to new client acquisition and client liquidity events; continued strong credit quality and, of course, exceptional gains on VC-related investments of $36 million net of noncontrolling interests.", "Our clients are doing exceptionally well, and our focus on helping them succeed is allowing us to share in their success. Mike will go into details on those results in a few minutes. But first, I want to talk about the business environment, share some stories about successes from the quarter and end by giving you a preview of our outlook for 2014.", "Starting with the business environment.", "There's a lot of good value creation happening at our markets, in exits, as well as in fundraising and investments. There were 26 IPOs in the third quarter that raised $2.7 billion. This represents the best quarter for IPOs in 3 years and the first consecutive quarter of 20 or more IPOs since 2004. Of the 54 U.S. venture-backed IPOs so far in 2013, 28 were SVB clients. Other exit activity was also healthy in the third quarter with growth in M&A deal and dollar volumes. A great example of the healthy IPO market was the recent IPO of cybersecurity company, FireEye, which resulted in a significant investment securities gains to our SVB Capital business. SVB Capital offers a great example of how our focus on working with the best companies pays off in the long term.", "As a result of our long-standing personal relationships with VCs and entrepreneurs, and a reputation as a value-added partner, we're able to participate in the best funds and the best young companies like FireEye.", "New formation of such promising companies continued at a rapid pace, driven by solid VC fund-raising and investments which rose by 28% and 12%, respectively, in the third quarter.", "We continue to bring many new startups on board, and we added 349 new early-stage clients during the quarter. Year-to-date, we've added more than 1,000 new early-stage clients, a 25% increase over 2012.", "Similarly, our efforts to win and keep larger later-stage clients are also succeeding. We added 27 new corporate finance clients in the third quarter, which is a big number for us, reflecting continued strong activity in buyout and in syndicated lending declines for a variety of purposes, including acquisitions, debt refinancings and dividend recaps.", "We build momentum in our global markets as well. Average loan balances for our global clients reached $600 million during the quarter, and total client funds hit $2.2 billion. This momentum was fueled, in part, by financings from some significant cross-border deals, including the acquisition of a German hospitality technology company by a U.S. private equity firm; the acquisition of an Indian logistics company by a U.K. transportation technology firm; and a major capital call facility for a London private equity firm investing cross-border.", "In addition to these successes, our reputation as a valued partner in the global innovation ecosystem is growing as evidenced by 2 recent awards. For the second year running, we received the European Investor AllStars Service Provider of the Year award. This award is voted on live at the ceremony by more than 600 investors and entrepreneurs and reflects the popular sentiment of the innovation community.", "In China, Ken Wilcox, my predecessor and now president of our joint venture bank received Shanghai's highest honor for expatriates, the Magnolia Memorial award. This award recognizes contribution to the city's economic, social and cultural development. It is unusual for someone to receive the award after such a short time in Shanghai, and that's a tremendous recognition of the impact Ken and his team are having there.", "Our strategy of helping clients in their earliest stages and adding value as they grow across all facets of their activities has enabled SVB to become the global bank for the innovation economy.", "There are 3 principle ways we add value to our clients. First, we build deeper relationships with and between entrepreneurs, investors and partners. We have literally thousands of interactions every month in our ecosystem, not just phone calls, but face-to-face connections and introductions that educate our clients and move them forward. Here are 3 examples from the third quarter: we hosted a speed-dating event for start-up companies in behalf of a large biotech company looking for potential acquisitions; we had a luncheon for high-profile cybersecurity clients with the White House's cybersecurity coordinator; and we hosted a fireside chat with Al Gore for cleantech-focused VCs and entrepreneurs to discuss the future of the cleantech industry. This event was part of a CEO discussion series we hosted to highlight our 30th anniversary in 20 different cities around the United States.", "Second, we give advice. Entrepreneurs and investors in the innovation space have to move quickly and learn quickly. After 30 years of helping them do this, we have a lot of resources to offer. For example, we hosted a leadership summit for finance professionals from the world's leading private equity and venture capital firms. We had a weeklong trip to China for health care executives interested in entering China's health care market, and we hosted a seminar by SVB analytics on private company valuations and trends.", "Third, we solve problems and make it easy for our clients to do business with us. Some of these activities are geared towards helping clients overcome logistical hurdles to their success. For instance, we hosted 2 demo days that brought together entrepreneurs with Fortune 50 corporate venturing groups seeking investment and product feedback. We also hosted a half day forum for U.S. entrepreneurs on how to do business in Russia, featuring top Russian investors, companies and service providers. Other activities involve investments to make it easier for our clients to do business with us. For example, we introduced a variety of mobile banking enhancements, including mobile check deposit, the ability to sign account opening documents electronically and login authentication by text or phone call. All these activities are integral to the way we do business, and we believe they give us a significant advantage over our competition. More importantly, we realize that to stay ahead, we need to continue to help our clients raise the bar for ourselves and continue to differentiate ourselves.", "All that said, we're also well aware of the challenges facing us and the banking industry. The lackluster economy continues to create uncertainty. Headwinds from low interest rates continue to limit the pace of growth. We do not expect to see that change in the near future. Growing regulatory requirements and costs are putting additional burdens on banks and competition for clients is very intense. Despite these challenges, we believe we have several advantages. Our clients are doing well and consistently outperform the broader economy. We have growth opportunities that do not depend on near-term interest-rate increases. Our strategy of going upstream, going global, expanding our private banking and scaling efficiently is driving meaningful results. We are leveraging new regulatory requirements, particularly capital stress testing, to learn and to enhance our risk management for continued effective growth. And our differentiation gives us a competitive advantage. Clients come to us for our decades of experience, connections and the ability to improve their chances of success.", "Looking to our 2014 outlook, we feel good about our position now and about our prospects for continuing growth in the year ahead. As in prior years, this outlook is preliminary. It's based on the information we have now and is subject to change. We assume no material downturn in the U.S. or global economies and no change in short-term interest rates.", "First, we expect average loan growth for 2014 to remain healthy at a percentage rate in the midteens. The dollar amount associated with this growth is generally in line with our current pace of loan growth. Second, we expect net charge-offs of 30 to 50 basis points of average total gross loans. Third, we expect net interest income to grow in the high single digits. Fourth, we expect the core fee income growth range from the high-single digits to the low double digits. And finally, we expect expense growth in the mid-single digits. We are optimistic about the year ahead because of our clients and they're doing well. The innovation industry is growing, and we're growing with it. Our market position and unique value proposition offers a solid platform for continued revenue growth and expansion of our client base. We are differentiated by our ability to add value to our clients, our outstanding employees and our reputation as the leading financial partner for innovating companies globally.", "Thank you. And now I'm going to turn it over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone.", "We are very pleased with our solid performance in the third quarter, which was marked by strong performance in loans, total client funds and our VC-related investments. There are 6 things I will highlight in my comments today. First, another quarter of healthy loan growth and continued strong credit quality. Second, higher net interest income despite a decrease in net interest margin. Third, significant growth in total client funds, meaning on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet funds. Fourth, exceptional gains on our VC-related investments and equity warrants. Fifth, higher expenses, due principally to higher incentive compensation related to our strong financial performance. And sixth, continued solid capital ratios. And of course, I will update you on our full year 2013 guidance.", "Before I start, I want to note 3 items impacting our EPS in the quarter which we have outlined in our press release. First, gains from the FireEye IPO added $0.42 to EPS. That number reflects gains from non-marketable securities and warrants, less the associated incentive compensation expense. While gains on VC investments and warrants are part of our core business, the outsized nature of the gains related to FireEye was unique. Second, a onetime income tax adjustment related to a prior period had a negative EPS impact of $0.06. And third, the impairment of a direct equity investment had a negative EPS impact of $0.05.", "Now let us move to loans. We have solid loan growth during the quarter, with strength across all of our client segments. Average loans reached another all-time high of $9.5 billion, growing $524 million or 5.8%. This increase reflected continued healthy demand among our venture capital and private equity clients, as well as larger software clients, coupled with the carryover effect of high period-end corporate finance balances in Q2. Our efforts to win and retain larger clients continued to pay off.", "We also had a notable increase of $890 million in unfunded credit commitments which reached $10.7 billion during the quarter. Our pipeline remains healthy going into the fourth quarter, and we believe we are on track to hit the top end of the range of our full year 2013 loan outlook.", "Turning to credit quality. It remains very good. Our provision for loan losses was $10.6 million, driven primarily by net charge-offs of $5.5 million and by loan growth. This compares to a provision of $18.6 million in the second quarter. Gross charge-offs were lower at $8.1 million and, consistent with our historical experience, came primarily from our early-stage hardware and software portfolios. This compares to gross charge-offs of $15.4 million in the second quarter. Our loans -- our allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total gross loans increased to 1.26% from 1.23% in the third quarter, primarily due to an increase in reserves for impaired loans related to 1 loan. While classified loans increased by 16% in the quarter, driven primarily by the addition of a few larger loans, classified loans as a percentage of total loans remains consistent with our historical known. And in this quarter-to-date, we have seen improvement in some of these loans.", "In terms of our outlook on credit quality for 2013, we're expecting to hit our metrics, and we believe net charge-offs will be at the low end of our projected range.", "Now let me turn to net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income was $177.5 million, an increase of $7 million or 4.1%. This increase was driven by strong loan volumes and was helped by 1 extra day in the third quarter versus the second quarter. It was offset somewhat by lower blended loan yields and lower balances in our available-for-sale securities portfolio. Overall loan yield was 5.81%, a slight reduction from our second quarter yield of 5.86%. This was due to our changing loan mix and continued competitive pressure, as well as growth in lower yielding private equity and venture capital call lines.", "Lower average balances in our available-for-sale securities portfolio resulted in a $1.1 million decrease in interest income. Average AFS balances decreased by $344 million to $10.1 billion due to the timing of our deployment of deposit inflows and our continued use of portfolio maturities to fund loan growth. On a period-end basis, AFS securities balance has increased slightly by $167 million to $10.2 billion due to new investments of $686 million, primarily on fixed-rate agency issued mortgage-backed securities and U.S. agency debentures. These new investments were partially offset by paydowns of $542 million. The duration of the portfolio remains stable at 2.7 years at the end of the third quarter. As a result of our better-than-expected net interest income, we are raising our 2013 growth outlook from the high single digits to the low double digits.", "Turning to net interest margin. Our net interest margin decreased by 8 basis points to 3.32% in the third quarter. The decrease is primarily due to higher levels of cash held at the Federal Reserve. Both average and period-end cash balances increased significantly during the quarter due to large deposit inflows early in the quarter and the timing of our deployment of those balances. Premium amortization expense related to our investment securities portfolio remained flat at $6.2 million. We believe that is a reasonable run rate for future quarters based on our current investment portfolio composition. We are on track to meet our 2013 net interest margin outlook, although NIM will continue to be significantly influenced by deposit and loan growth as well as premium amortization.", "Now let us look at total client funds. Average total client funds, that is, the sum of our on-balance sheet deposits and our off-balance sheet client investment funds, increased by $2.7 billion or 6.5% to $44.5 billion. This increase reflects strong growth in deposits and off-balance sheet funds as our clients saw increases in liquidity due to healthy VC-related investing and exits, and we continue to add new clients at a steady pace.", "Average deposits grew by $946 million or 5.1% to $19.6 billion primarily due to strong acquisition of early-stage and venture capital and private equity clients. Average off-balance sheet client investment funds increased by $1.8 billion or 7.6% to $25 billion as a result of active VC investment in IPO markets, as well as increased use of our off-balance sheet suite product. This is the first time average total client investment funds have reached $25 billion.", "Now let us move to noninterest income. Noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interest, was $105.8 million compared to $67.4 million in the second quarter. That is a non-GAAP number. The increase was driven by significant gains on investment securities and equity warrants related to the FireEye IPO. Gains on investment securities net of noncontrolling interest were $36.5 million compared to $9.5 million in the second quarter. The majority of these gains, approximately $29 million, were related to valuation increases and carried interest from our managed direct funds and debt funds that held investment in FireEye. Gains on equity warrants were $18.8 million compared to $7.2 million in the second quarter. $15 million of the gain was due to unrealized valuation gains on the portfolio, including $8 million from FireEye. The remaining $4 million was attributable to warrant exercises. These gains were driven primarily by strong M&A and IPO activity among our clients.", "While VCP-related [ph] investments and warrants are very much a part of our core business model, there was a unique alignment of conditions that made this FireEye impact much larger than normal. First, the majority of our investments was through our investment and debt funds. Second, we held a larger investment in FireEye than we typically make. Third, we received significant carried interest on our investment. And finally, we had warrants. On top of this, FireEye was the largest IPO of the quarter.", "It is important to note that there is a 180-day lockup period on our FireEye investments and warrants, and that their value will fluctuate during their lockup period and until, if and when, any sales and investments are made.", "Now let us turn to core fee income, that is, fees from foreign exchange, deposit service charges, credit cards, client investments and letters of credit. Core fee income increased slightly by $688,000 to 37 -- excuse me, $37.2 million driven primarily by higher revenue from credit cards. Credit card revenue increased by $579,000 or 7.6% to $8.1 million due to higher transaction volumes and transaction values as well as steadily increasing client adoption. Client investments fees declined $131,000 or 3.7% to $3.4 million despite significant growth in balances, due to continued margin pressure which as a result of the current low rate environment. We saw strong volumes and healthy new client acquisition in foreign exchange, although that was offset by increasing and continuing margin pressure. Foreign exchange revenue increased slightly by $109,000 to $12.9 million. Due to continued margin pressure in client investment fees and foreign exchange fees, we are decreasing our 2013 outlook for core fee income growth from the low double digits to the high single digits. Nevertheless, our client acquisition and overall client activity are strong, and we remain optimistic about the long-term growth prospects for core fee income.", "Now I'll move on to expenses. Noninterest expense was $160.5 million, an increase of $17.2 million or 12% from the prior quarter. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $12.1 million in incentive compensation due to our strong performance in the third quarter and the year so far. As we have said before, incentive compensation is a significant variable in our expenses since it is determined by our performance relative to that of our peer group and our internal goals. But in short, when we outperform, it goes up. As a result of higher incentive compensation from higher net interest income, as well as strong warrants and investment gains in the third quarter, we are increasing our 2013 expense outlook from a percentage increase in the mid single digits to the low double digits.", "Now I'll move on to capital. Our capital position remained strong and is supported by continued solid earnings growth and credit performance. The holding company total risk-based capital ratio increased by 13 basis points to 14.16%, primarily because of sizable gains on VC and PE-related investment securities. The bank level total risk-based capital ratio decreased by 11 basis points to 12.31% due primarily to strong loan growth and a $10 million dividend paid by the bank to the holding company. And the bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased by 20 basis points to 7.46% primarily due to significant deposit growth and the dividend paid by the bank to the holding company.", "To wrap up, we are extremely pleased with our performance in the third quarter and the year so far. Our clients are doing very well, and our markets are thriving. We are consistently delivering strong results despite the low interest rate environment and increasing competition. Regardless of the environment, we will continue to execute on our strategy and focus on achieving things within our control. These include: driving strong client acquisition by differentiating ourselves in the market; maintaining high credit quality; ensuring liquidity and flexibility in our balance sheet; and achieving efficient scalable growth. This focus, fueled by the creativity and drive of our employees, will help to maintain our position as the premier financial partner to the world's most innovative clients.", "Thank you. And now, we'll be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Operator", "Okay, our first question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin from Sterne Agee.", "[Technical Difficulty]", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "I wanted to first ask if you could just give a little more color around the guidance for deposit growth for the full year essentially implies that it slows down quite a bit in 4Q. Can you -- I guess, first talk about that? And then secondly, the follow-up was just on the guidance for '14 implicitly assumes the margin would come down given the growth of loans with slower spread revenue growth. Can you talk maybe about those 2 things?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes, I'll talk to the first part of the question which is with respect to deposits. I mean, you saw for the fist time this year that deposits came back and it came back significantly strong. But you will recall that the first half of the year was essentially flat. So we still have our growth outlook for 2013 as we just mentioned. But again, we've continued to believe we'll still see some deposit growth, but again, with such a massive run up here in the third quarter. But nonetheless, we still expect some continued growth in the fourth quarter.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and any thoughts around the conservatism with forward margin expectations?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Sorry, maybe just repeat because you had such a long question, Brett. I apologize [indiscernible] on your first part.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Essentially, I'm just asking around the early 2014 guidance. Just thinking about the spread revenue growth being in the single digits with the loan growth being, obviously, in a dollar amount about the same as this year, would imply that the margin goes down a little lower from present levels. Any thoughts about just why you're thinking about that? Would it be in loan pricing or some other variable?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "If you're talking about the core fee income growth was your first part of your question or not?", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "No, it's actually...", "Gregory W. Becker", "No, no, no, spread, spread. So Brett, this is Greg. So the spread -- the single digits -- high single digits for next year is really driven from the loan growth. It's by mix -- loan mix is one thing. And the second part is definitely from a pricing compression. So you can look at the mix, and we've seen this for this past year, and we've seen it last past couple of years. So as you head to do more capital call lending, as you tend to do more corporate finance lending, that tends to be a lower margin than the average loan yield, so that tends to bring down your loan margin a little bit. So although loan growth is in the midteens, the net interest income was on the lower side. So that's -- and we don't give guidance for deposits so you kind of -- that's the combination that creates the high single digits.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Just a follow-up on the growth in client funds. I guess, for the piece coming from new client acquisition, how much would you say is coming from new companies being started and how much is more market share gains? And then for the piece that's more the client liquidity events of this quarter, how sticky are these deposits typically and how rate-sensitive?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Joe, it's -- let me -- this is Greg. I'll start and then Mike may want to add to it. So there, it's kind of across the board. When you look at new client acquisition, clearly, that's part of it, but it's not the main part of it. Because when you -- even if you add 300 or 400 new clients to the thousands of clients, it still isn't that big from a numbers perspective. It really is that our clients, overall, had very nice fundraising, and that's both from new rounds of private equity financing, as you saw in the venture capital numbers, they were very strong in the quarter, as well as liquidity events. When you look at total client funds, clearly, because of the number of IPOs there were, and we funded a fair share of them, that adds a fair amount of liquidity to, especially, the off-balance sheet numbers. So it's really not one thing, it's really all of them. As far as interest rate sensitivity, I guess we're looking for the day where we can actually have a conversation about interest rate sensitivity because right now, there's no margin. So it's kind of hard to determine what behavior is. We are, obviously, planning for rates to pick up at some point and then, we want to make sure we have a broad enough product set, product offering, that we can make sure we try to find the right balance between on and off-balance sheet of deposits. So right now, I would say there really isn't a lot of sensitivity because there really isn't a lot of yield to find those right now.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Okay, and I guess following up on that point, again, despite all this growth in client funds, deposit service charges have been relatively flat and client SMPs, as you say, down both quarter-to-quarter and year-over-year. Has there been that much margin pressure over the past 12 months or some of these revenues, some of these clients are being captured elsewhere like through compensating balances or something like that?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Joe, it's Greg again. Let me start with the first one, and that's -- it is compensating balances. And when you see the level of deposit growth, even though the earnings credit rate is so low, you basically -- it covers a lot more of the fees. So it was a slight decline. It was a slight decline last quarter and so it really is, to your point, compensating balances related and the growth in deposits. So that's one thing. The second part, when you look at the spread that we're getting on the off-balance sheet funds, there has been margin compression. It doesn't take much. If you're going down to -- you're looking at getting 5 basis points basically and it drops from 8 basis points of fees for us to 5 basis points, that's still a lot of depression or decline even with the growth in off balance sheet. So from that standpoint, we're, again, waiting for rates to pick back up so we can go back to a more normal or appropriate fee-sharing relationship on the off-balance sheet funds.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to start and follow up on the comments on guidance. I know it really is preliminary for 2014. But when we look at the midteens loan growth, it's still very strong, but it is a bit of a step down from the 20% range we've been seeing this year. Are you just being conservative with the guidance or are there specific segments of the loan book where you're expecting a slowdown?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, Steve, it's Greg. I'll start then Michael probably want to add. Part of it is just when you look at the base of -- the size of the loan base right now, it's significant -- we've seen significant growth. So when you just look at average growth, even the midteens is a substantial number. And as I said in my comments, it's generally aligned with the absolute growth we've seen over the last couple of years. So it's less about being able to keep that pace on a percentage basis. It's more -- we're looking more at the absolute growth numbers. And as we said, it's preliminary. But right now, that's our best view forward for 2014.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. And maybe to follow up, I know you addressed this before but in terms of the disparity between that outlook and the growth for mid or single-digit net interest income growth, are you expecting an outflow of deposits next year? Is that embedded in this assumption?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Steve, this is Mike. We haven't given the guidance on the deposits outflow for next year. But again, our -- right now, we believe we're going to continue to grow the deposit base. I mean, you've seen how the deposit franchise is. I mean, client investment funds off the balance sheets continue to be strong. But again, we are expecting some positive growth next year.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "So just a quick question in terms of looking at the leverage ratio. I mean, I guess you have a fair degree of a buffer at this point, both at the bank and the holding company level. Do you see as internal capital generation to be enough based on sort of the preliminary guidance that you gave to sustain that without having to sort of come to the market for any sort of growth capital?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes, that's right. I mean, we expect to be self-funding our growth. When you look at basically the run rate of our earnings in the given quarter at the bank levels and you target a certain total risk-based capital ratio and it's essentially adequate enough to cover what we're forecasting for loan growth. So the short answer is, no, at this point, we don't anticipate going to the market.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And then I guess my second question in terms of, Greg, you mentioned that the FireEye was not the typical investment that you guys make. I'm just wondering, given the strength and the sort of the tech IPO activity, what's the -- what are the chances of similar gains over the next 12 to 18 months or was it that unique that it's unlikely to be repeated anytime soon?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Ebrahim, this is Greg, and I think there's a couple of factors there. The one part is we had so many touch points into FireEye, whether it was warrants, it was gains and funds that we had invested into fund-to-funds. It was in our direct funds. So it was so broadly based. That's what made it unique, number one, and what it made unique, number two, is that it was such a substantial IPO, right? It was the largest IPO in the quarter. I would -- we would love to see more FireEyes in the next 12 to 18 months, but the probability of that happening is very low.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Aaron Deer of Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And the -- I guess, I just wanted to follow up on something that you said earlier, Greg, about the intensity of competition out there right now. In the past, you've talked about the kind of capriciousness of competition or competitors come in when the market is hot, but then kind of run and hide when things take a turn. With the economy moving to a large degree towards kind of more innovation kind of sectors, is the nature of the competition that you're seeing changing? Is it more sophisticated and more dedicated to the space for the longer term?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Aaron, I think, from our standpoint, there's a couple of things happening. You pointed up to one, which is the innovation economy is growing at the fastest pace of really any of the parts of the market or the economy. And if you just take a step back, clearly, we expect that to happen for the foreseeable future, that's why we like the space we're in so much. Does that then entail that we are going to see competition, competitors, be here for a longer period of time? I think that's probably a legitimate conclusion. The reason I spent a fair amount of time in my opening comments talking about the various things that we do to add value to our clients, really, from my standpoint, is that's where the competitive differentiation is. We spend so much time not only just looking at our products and services and making sure they're competitive, but we really say, what are the additional things that we can do by virtue of the market share we have, the reach that we have, the relationships we have, that we can bring to our clients that no one else can. And that's really the differentiation that we spend so much time on, and that's the feedback we hear from our clients. So yes, it's competitive. It will continue to be competitive. Clearly, if the market turns down a little bit, some people will back away, but we do expect this competitive landscape to be here for the foreseeable future. But we just need to continue to raise the bar and differentiate ourselves.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And then beyond the kind of changes in the types of loans that you're doing, I think you've mentioned in response to Joe's question about as you go into some different loan types that the yield is going to be lower. Is there -- are yields still coming down in general just from that competitive pressure that we're seeing out there right now?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, a little bit, but I'd say the majority of the decline in margin relates to mix. And again, it's -- the biggest growth that we've seen, you look at Capital Call Loans is probably one of the biggest areas. And when you look at lending money to large -- larger money Capital Call Loans to top-quality firms, you're in that prime range, and that's obviously lower than the average loan yield that we have, so just that alone, as we continue to grow that business, you're going to see some pressure on the overall loan margin as an example.", "Operator", "Next, we have a question from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "On the international front, your loan balances have grown quite a bit in the last couple of years. I'm just curious as to, if you could give us some qualitative commentary on sort of were you ahead of expectations or behind, versus maybe what you're budgeting or thinking about a couple of years ago?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Jennifer. This is Greg. And yes, it's -- from my standpoint, we are ahead of where -- a couple of years ago, I would have thought we were going to where we had been. And it's really driven by a couple of things. First of all, what's evolved in our business model over the last several years, or the last like 4 or 5 years, is that we're able to do bigger, more well-structured Capital Call Loans, loans to corporate finance companies. And so when you look at that, we're not going into the U.K., as an example, and just doing early-stage loans, we're doing capital call lending. We're doing buyout financing. We're doing loans to corporate finance sized clients. When you do those larger loans, again, very similar structure to what we're doing in the United States, very similar equity sponsors, those loans add up pretty quickly. So you can get to pretty substantial balances in a very short period of time, remaining consistent with our credit quality standards. And I think that's the big difference that allows us to grow that business at a fast pace. And what I've said before in prior calls, there's no reason that I see that we couldn't be growing that 30%, 40%, 50% per year for the next few years. And you add that to the growth that we have in the United States, that's really where we see a lot of upside.", "Jennifer H. Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division", "And I have one more question. Greg, all the events that you mentioned at the top of the call that were just mentioned on the last question, I mean, has that increased for you in the last year or so? Have you done more of that as competition has increased?", "Gregory W. Becker", "We've -- I'd say, we've done it for 2 reasons and the answer is, yes, we've increased it. One is it's really positive feedback from our clients. And the one thing that's changed is that, is you see these larger corporations; Fortune 50, Fortune 500 companies, and they're really struggling with trying to figure out how they can tap into the innovative -- innovation economy more quickly, they're nervous in a lot of ways. We're one of the only places where they can come and really broadly connect with these next-generation emerging technology companies. So the number of phone calls we're getting and relationships we're building with larger companies where we can introduce them to our client base is substantial. And it's a win-win, right? So the big companies come to us, and that's great, and the smaller companies and medium-sized companies, look at us and say, \"You're the only one that can do that\". So it's both driven by clients, but it's also driven, to your point, we want to continue to distance ourselves from competition. And from that standpoint, the best way to do it is to add value in a way that we don't think other companies can.", "Operator", "We have a question from the line of Julianna Balicka from KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I had a couple of questions, please. One, you talked about this during your remarks. On the cash redeployment, just to clarify, the balance was up on an average basis and also up at the end of the quarter. So have you redeployed that cash already in October or that's still pending throughout the fourth quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So, we're certainly looking at it to deploy here in the beginning of the quarter as well, but what do we -- what we wanted to make sure is when you have these deposits coming on this excess cash is to make sure it's going to be sticky and make sure it's going to be around. So that's why it's a little bit of a timing issue. But again, we certainly are looking to, in general, all things being equal to try to bring down those cash balances that we had during the quarter, so that is likely to happen this quarter.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And do you think you'll go back to your previous run rate within a quarter or it will take more like a couple of quarters?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I think we'll catch up fairly fast. Again, there's always a certain kind of level of the targeted cash that you want to hold, given the size of your balance sheet. But again, we will continue to invest the excess.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And what are you investing -- what yields, I mean, are you investing to excess in right now?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So it can range from a few places. I mean, you could on U.S. agency debentures, that's probably around 1.5%, 1.6%. If you start getting into some of the agency passers, you may be looking at 240, 250. So kind of overall blended yield, somewhere around that 200 to 215 basis points, somewhere in that range.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Got it. And to finalize, a follow-up on this topic. On the -- you discussed the impact on your off-balance sheet funding from the liquidity events of clients. So 2 questions on that. One, are those going to be fairly sticky or they -- you expect them to kind of run off within a couple of quarters as those funds get reinvested elsewhere? And also two, within the deposit growth, you call that deposit growth from various client sources, but has that also come from these liquidity events on the on-balance sheet and therefore, we should think about the redeployment on the client side?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Maybe I'll start with the off-balance sheet. I mean, we actually expect them to be fairly sticky. I mean, our clients continue to do well. They continue to generate a lot of cash. And obviously, when they come in with a lot of the surplus cash, they actually are looking to kind of a little bit longer term investment, obviously, preserving capital and liquidity is a top of mind. But again, we do expect the off-balance sheet to be more or less sticky.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And then was any of that also in the on-balance sheet?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So as Greg was talking about earlier, I mean, we had -- a fair amount is some of the early-stage clients that are generating a lot of cash. And some of those will continue into something of a burn scenario as well as they continue to invest and develop products as well. But again, I wouldn't say, we'd have any differing attributes than what we've seen in the past.", "Operator", "Next, we have a question from the line of John Pancari from Evercore.", "Stephen M. Moss - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "It's actually Steve Moss on behalf of John. Most of my questions really have been answered. Really, congratulations on this quarter here. I'm just wondering a little bit in terms of the larger loans. What's the average size of loans greater than $20 million that you're putting on the balance sheet these days?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So this is Greg. I'll start and Marc Cadieux, our Chief Credit Officer, will add some commentary. When you look at the average loan size above $20 million, yes, that number has increased, but the average truly isn't that much greater than the $20 million. So it's, again, just north of the $20 million, but I'm going to let Marc give you a little more detail.", "Marc Cadieux", "I think Greg answered it well -- it's Marc Cadieux that -- and it depends on the type of lending we're doing, but the average really isn't that much above $20 million, probably in that plus or minus $25 million range.", "Stephen M. Moss - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then I guess just one more thing, you guys, sound a little more optimistic to me in terms of what definitely Marc called an early stage development. Just wondering where that is as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio these days?", "Gregory W. Becker", "This is Greg. The early-stage loan portfolio as a percentage has -- it's been dropping modestly. And it's not that it's not growing. It actually is growing but the rest of the portfolio is growing at a faster pace. So you're looking at a 7-ish percent of the overall portfolio, 7% to 8%, and that's where it's going to be right now. And again, if you look forward the next 1 to 2 years, that will probably continue to decline modestly.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Just to clarify. I mean, it's an extremely important part of our business model. So just because the numbers are coming down, doesn't lessen the importance. In fact, it becomes even more important as far as a source of future clients. Because remember, a lot of our clients grow up with us, so capturing those clients early on is extremely important to us.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, to Mike's point, we expect it would continue to grow. It's just the rest of the loan book will grow at a faster pace. Therefore, on a percentage basis, it will have a modest decline.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Just quickly here. I just wanted to go back towards the issue of the innovation economy and just ask a more kind of thematic question. I mean, you guys have done very well over there. I'm curious how you see sort of the impact of the -- on the innovation economy of the fiscal uncertainty that we've had for a while now, and most pronouncedly recently with the shutdown and everything, and its spillover effect. I mean, do you think that it's -- do you think the innovation economy in spite of that has been remarkably resilient? I mean, do you think that -- how do you think of the upside might look like and if we can finally dispose of with this fiscal clouds. I mean, how do you think this economy -- this part of economy might kind of rev up if we can get rid of some of this uncertainty once and for all?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, Gaston, this is Greg. I'll start. The innovation economy hasn't really been impacted much from my standpoint. And part of it is because it's been a short period of time. Now if that had lasted and we'll find out pretty soon in kind of the January, February time period, if it starts to actually have a long-term effect and you start to have bigger issues, then, I think quite honestly, it's going to impact the overall economy and the innovation economy is more immune, but it's not completely immune to what happens in D.C. So that answers the second question which is do I believe there's upside if it's get resolved. There may be modest upside. But again, because it really hasn't negatively impacted, you probably won't see a bounce back because it hasn't dropped down. So where it stands right now, little impact. The one place where you'd see it first, if it was a little bit longer, would be our clients that sell into the government. Now that isn't high concentration, by any means, but we clearly have some companies that sell into the government and they would be impacted first. So let's keep our fingers crossed, the government figures it out and doesn't extend it in January.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and I'm sorry one last thing very quickly. I know you talked a lot about deposit growth and that sort of thing. Any thoughts on -- sorry, if you mentioned this, but any thoughts on how you see the mix evolving within deposits or pretty steady compared to what it's been?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I think at this juncture, we'd more or less assume the same proportions or similar growth that we've seen over the last several quarters.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] We have another question from the line of Herman Chan of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Herman Chan - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Just wanted to follow-up on the competitive front. Are you seeing competition intensify in some various buckets of your business' early-stage, capital call buyout or is it more of a mix?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Herman, this is Greg, and it is pretty much a mix domestically. It is that you see it at the early-stage, you see it at the late stage. It varies -- competitors vary in a segment by segment basis. But clearly, we're seeing competition, I would say, across the board. A little bit less on the international side but it's still a competitive market for the reasons I described earlier.", "Operator", "There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call back to Greg Becker for closing comments.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great, thanks. So let me just wrap up. It was a great quarter and, as I said earlier in my comments and Mike did as well, we're clearly optimistic about the various growth opportunities we have over the coming quarters and years, despite the competitive landscape. And as we reflect back on our 3 years of growth, clearly, carving out a unique place in the innovation ecosystem, we're really proud of the company we've built and the more than 30,000 companies we've helped over our history. And I guess it's important from my standpoint to thank all our employees, those with us from the early days as well as those who have recently joined us, because it's really their dedication and commitment to clients that really I think sets us apart. And I also want to thank all the innovation companies who have put their faith and trust in us. And at the end of the day, what gets us out of bed in the morning is that we're just thrilled to be their financial partners because, as we've said in the past, they really are changing the world. So it's great to be here, it's great to be 30 years. And thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the SVB Financial Group's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Jamie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today for our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our fourth quarter and full year results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "I would like to remind everyone that our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "I wish to caution you that we'll be making forward-looking statements during this call and that actual results may differ materially. As usual, we encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including a reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We plan to limit the length of the call, including Q&A, to 1 hour. [Operator Instructions] And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thanks, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. The fourth quarter of 2013 was an outstanding end to an outstanding year for SVB. We delivered earnings per share of $1.27 and net income of $58.8 million for the quarter. For the full year 2013, we delivered earnings per share of $4.70 and net income of $215.9 million. And total 2013 revenues, that would be net interest income plus non-interest income, excluding non-controlling interest, exceeded $1 billion for the first time in our history.", "By all accounts, 2013 was our best year ever. We delivered strong growth across the business. We grew average loans by 24% to $9.4 billion, and we finished the year at $10.9 billion. We grew average total client funds, that is deposits plus off-balance sheet client investments, by 15% to $43.8 billion and finished the year at $48.8 billion. We grew net interest income by 13% to $697 million. We grew non-interest income, net of controlling interest, by 37% to $330 million. This number notably reflected significant gains from investment securities and warrants, thanks to healthy venture funding and exit markets.", "Finally, we maintained excellent credit quality with net charge-off ratio of 33 basis points for the full year. We are very proud of these results, especially in light of the modest economy and continued low interest rate environment. Mike will go into the financial details in a few minutes. But first, I want to spend some time talking about our accomplishments in the business that helped drive these results.", "Our strong performance was driven by a single-minded pursuit of 1 goal: to be the bank for the global innovation economy. Our strategy for achieving that goal is simple. It calls for building relationships with companies as they get started and keeping them as they grow, expanding our client base to include larger companies and select private equity firms within the innovation space, increasing our market share of the best companies, deepening our relationships with venture capital and private equity general partners as well as select CEOs through private banking and, of course, taking our business model global.", "Our effective execution of our strategy in 2013 helped us to move closer to our goal. Let me provide some details. I'll start with the early stage. We added more than 2,000 new early stage clients in 2013. We were able to do this because, in our position as the banking partner of choice for angel, accelerator, corporate and venture capital-backed startups, we're able to cement relationships early and show clients how our knowledge, networks and solutions can truly help them be successful with their business. Solidifying relationships early is a significant advantage in maintaining our status as the go-to bank in the venture capital-backed market and retaining our clients as they grow.", "In addition, our investments in digital and mobile client systems significantly streamlined our ability to on board and serve these clients and provide them a better client experience.", "Our ability to keep early stage clients as they grow was helped by our investments in products and people geared to the needs of larger companies. The transition from early stage to what we call a growth company is a critical time in our client relationships. During this time, we need to make sure we're scaling with the growth of these businesses by supporting them with new products, services, larger credit solutions especially for the highest profile companies.", "As we've worked to build relationships with high-profile companies, our market share with these companies has increased. One proxy for our success in this area is our market share of venture-backed IPOs. In 2013, 64% of U.S.-based venture-backed companies that went public were SVB clients, and the majority of these clients put all or the majority of their IPO proceeds into our client investment funds, which helped to drive off-balance sheet fund growth of 20%.", "Our investment in working with larger companies also allowed us to add 51 new corporate finance clients and drive $600 million in new corporate finance loan outstandings. And although the number of new clients may seem small when compared to our early stage client numbers, these corporate finance clients typically use more products and services and generate 10x to 20x more revenue for us.", "We're also successful at solidifying and expanding our relationships with private equity firms, which, like venture capital firms, are both clients and a source of clients. That effort drilled more than $400 million of growth in sponsor-led buyouts in 2013 and contributed to more than $650 million of growth in capital call lines of credit.", "And what's important to note, as successful as we've been in growing this business, our market share remains modest, given the size of the market. With this in mind, we remain very well positioned for continued growth in the business.", "Another focus in 2013 was our continued global expansion. Internally, we refer to global as the business that we do around the world outside of our domestic market. In 2013, we grew our global loan outstandings by 92% to $800 million, our deposits by 41% to $2.5 billion and our total credit commitments to $1.6 billion. While the direct bottom line impacting this growth will be more substantial in the future, the growth rates are inspiring.", "After 18 months of operation by our U.K. branch, we've attracted more than 500 corporate clients in the U.K.. In China, which is a longer-term growth proposition, we just completed our joint venture bank's first full year of operation, and we continue to make progress in forming relationships and winning new clients that will support our long-term growth there.", "In addition, we've gained more than 700 new clients since the inception of our global practice, who are leveraging our U.S. banking services as a result of in-market contacts made to our global expansions.", "Our successful client acquisition in all markets, global and domestic, helped to fuel growth in our global treasury in 2013, including the addition of more than 400 new global treasury clients; $25 billion in FX trades; a 10% increase in FX fees; and a 45% increase in foreign currency deposits in global cash management accounts.", "Our commercial bank's success has benefited our private bank, where we added more than 300 new client relationships during the year, reached period-end loan balances of $1 billion for the first time in our history and launched our new wealth management advisory group. Our private bank offers us the way to further cement our relationships with venture capital and private equity general partners, and CEOs are strategically important to our commercial banking relationships.", "As you can see in 2013, it was a very big year for SVB. We delivered exceptional numbers, advanced our goal with being the bank for the global innovation economy and positioned the company for future growth in 2014 and beyond.", "As we look ahead, our theme for 2014 is continued execution on our strategy. We believe we still have a lot of upside to our growth initiatives, so we will continue to cultivate relationships with larger innovation companies, venture capital and private equity firms and private bank clients. We'll continue to build our global presence. We will, of course, remain aggressive in supporting and working with early stage companies and their investors, and we'll continue to differentiate ourselves through our networks, our knowledge, our unique events that help move our clients' businesses forward and, of course, our dedicated employees.", "From an operational perspective, simplicity and scalability remain high priorities. Clearly, we're still a growth company, and we'll continue to invest in people, technology and markets to support that growth. We work committed to demonstrating the return on that investment in terms of ROE, as well as client numbers and profitability. We will remain focused on growing efficiently and leveraging opportunities to effectively manage the cost of our growth, as we have done with multi-sourcing and with the establishment of our Tempe, Arizona office.", "In addition, the digital mobile systems we have built to make it easy for our clients to do business with us will improve clients' experiences while allowing our client service teams to focus on the highest impact client interactions.", "Our challenges in 2014 will remain similar to our challenges in 2013. We expect competition to remain intense and interest rates to remain low in the near term, despite an improving outlook. And now that the Volcker Rule has been finalized, we'll need to work with regulators to implement it, a process that will be challenging for all banks, but we believe we are well positioned to meet these challenges. We're starting in 2014 on a very strong footing, given our 2013 performance. And then as you saw in our financial release, our outlook for the year is positive, and we've increased the range for expected loan growth. We see ample opportunity ahead. The pace of new company and intellectual property creation is very strong, and the quality of new companies has never been higher. New industries, new technologies and new opportunities are being created every day, which means the pie is getting bigger. More capital-efficient business models have opened up the landscape to new investors and new entrepreneurs, and the IPO market has come back in earnest, which has inspired growing confidence among VCs and investors. Our clients are doing very well, and their success creates new opportunities for us. By staying close to clients and their markets, maintaining our credit discipline and remaining focused on our mission of helping clients succeed, we expect to succeed as well. Thank you.", "And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike Descheneaux, who will talk about our financial results.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. It was a great quarter across the board, marked by outstanding growth in loans and client funds as well as significant private equity and venture capital related investment gains.", "There are 6 areas I will highlight my comments today: First, outstanding loan growth; second, exceptional growth in total client funds, meaning on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds; third, higher net interest income, despite a decrease in net interest margin; fourth, strong credit quality, notwithstanding a higher provision for loan losses; fifth, exceptional non-interest income growth due to substantial gains from our PE and VC-related investments and equity warrants, as well as strong core fee income growth; and, sixth, our capital ratios and the related impact of growth in the quarter, as well as our initial assessment on the finalized Volcker Rule impact.", "Let me start with loans. We had a phenomenal loan growth in the fourth quarter due to healthy demand across our client base. Average loans grew by 6.2% or $592 million and, for the first time in our history, crossed the $10 billion mark. This growth was driven by robust borrowing from our private equity clients, both directly and in connection with sponsor-led buyout transactions. Similarly, sponsor-led buyouts and capital call lending, combined with end-of-year activity, drove period-end loan growth of 11% or $1.1 billion. Period-end loans ended the year at $10.9 billion. A significant amount of our loan growth in the quarter came during the last 3 weeks of 2013, driven in particular by private equity capital call lines of credit. As a result, we could see tempered loan growth in the first quarter of 2014, similar to what we experienced in the first quarter of 2013. For the full year 2013, average loans grew by 24% to $9.4 billion, which was slightly higher than the upper range of our full year guidance.", "Now let us look at total client funds. Again, this includes both on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. In the fourth quarter, average total client funds grew by $3.2 billion to $47.7 billion. The increase was driven in part by average deposit growth of $1.9 billion to $21.5 billion. The growth was due to healthy liquidity among our existing venture capital, private equity and early-stage clients, as well as strong acquisition of new clients.", "Average off-balance sheet client investment funds grew by $1.3 billion to $26.2 billion due to healthy financing and IPO activity for our clients, as well as strong utilization of our off-balance sheet suite product. For the full year 2013, average deposits grew by 9.5% or $1.7 billion to $19.6 billion with the majority of the growth coming in the second half of 2013. This was well above our outlook range of mid-single digit growth.", "Moving onto net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $10 million or 5.6% to $187 million. This increase was driven by extremely strong loan growth and was partially offset by a 6 basis point decrease in overall loan yields, primarily driven by low market rates. Loan yields for the quarter were 5.75%. For the full year 2013, net interest income grew by 13%, which was better than our guidance of low-double digits growth.", "Moving to net interest margin. Our net interest margin declined 12 basis points to 3.2% compared to 3.32% in Q3. This decrease was primarily due to the significant growth in average deposits, which were invested in securities and due to lower market rates on loans. Our full year net interest margin of 3.29% fell in the middle of the guidance range we've provided. We expect our net interest margin in 2014 to continue to be significantly influenced by deposit and loan growth and, to a lesser extent, premium amortization related to our investment securities.", "Turning to credit quality. It remained healthy. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $28.7 million compared to $10.6 million in the third quarter. The higher provision was primarily driven by $10.5 million in net charge-offs, $10.3 million related to period-end loan growth and an increase of $7.8 million in the reserve for impaired loans. Gross charge-offs of $13.5 million included $6.6 million related to the resolution of 2 previously impaired hardware loans. We also saw stronger-than-expected recoveries of $3 million. For the full year, net charge-offs were 33 basis points of average total gross loans, at the low end of our guidance range of 30 to 50 basis points. Non-performing loans increased by $13.4 million to $51.6 million. And at 47 basis points, were within our guidance for the full year. Classified loans were flat to slightly down in Q4. As a result of the increase in our reserve for impaired loans, our allowance for loan losses increased by 4 basis points to 1.3%. Our allowance for loan losses for our performing loans decreased by 2 basis points to 1.11%, primarily due to continued strong performance of our performing loan portfolio and was in line with our outlook for the full year 2013.", "Now let us move to non-interest income. We had our second successive quarter of outstanding gains on private equity and venture capital related investment securities and equity warrants. These gains were due to strong IPO and venture-backed funding markets, as well as increasing public market valuations. As a result, non-GAAP non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest, was $100.9 million in the fourth quarter compared to $105.8 million in the third quarter, which was also an exceptional quarter due to investment and warrant gains. Gains on investment securities, net of non-controlling interest, were $26.1 million compared to $36.5 million in the third quarter. These gains were primarily from valuation increases, in other words, unrealized gains in our funds-of-funds and direct venture funds related to companies that went public during the third and fourth quarters. Valuation increases on our FireEye and Twitter holdings accounted for $13.6 million of these gains.", "As a reminder, unrealized gains from valuation changes are subject to fluctuations due to market conditions and other factors. The extent to which these and other unrealized gains will become realized gains is subject to numerous factors, including the expiration of current lock-up agreements, the actual sales of the securities, the timing of such sales and market conditions.", "Gains on equity warrants were also exceptionally strong in Q4 at $16.6 million compared to $18.8 million in the third quarter. They included $14.9 million in unrealized gains from valuation changes, driven by IPO and M&A activity, and $1.8 million in realized gains from warrant exercises. The unrealized gains notably included $6.1 million related to FireEye and Twitter.", "One final note on FireEye. As we noted in our press release, our combined FireEye investments and warrants have increased in value in the first quarter to-date due to FireEye's strong post-IPO performance. Since our valuation of those investments at December 31, 2013, FireEye's stock prices increased by approximately 70% as of yesterday's close. Based on this incremental increase in stock price, we would expect to record pre-tax gains, net of non-controlling interest, of approximately $50 million. I'm going to repeat that again, approximately $50 million. Of course, these gains are also subject to market change. The actual financial impact would depend on when we sell our holdings. As a reminder, they are in lockup until March of 2014.", "Now moving onto core fee income. Core fee income was also strong in the fourth quarter. Core fee income includes fees from foreign exchange, deposit service charges, credit cards and payments, client investments, letters of credit and lending-related fees, which we have included for the first time this quarter. Core fee income grew by 13% or $5.8 million to $49 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was primarily driven by higher foreign exchange fees, which increased by $2.2 million due to seasonally higher volumes. We also saw an increase of $1.9 million in lending-related fees, in particular, loan syndication fees. Additionally, credit card fees and payment fees grew by $1 million due to higher volumes. For the full year 2013, we delivered core fee income growth of 11%, which exceeded the revised guidance we provided in October.", "Now I'll move onto capital. Our capital position remains strong and is supported by continued solid earnings growth and credit performance. However, extraordinary deposit and loan growth during the fourth quarter did impact capital ratios across the board. In particular, our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased by 42 basis points to 7.04% due to the extraordinary deposit growth in the quarter.", "In other capital-related matters, the final Volcker Rule was issued last month, and we are currently assessing its impact on SVB. We currently estimate that approximately $282 million of our venture capital and private equity fund investments will be subject to Volcker Rule restrictions. As a result, we will be required to wind down or divest these investments by the deadline of July 21, 2015, unless we receive extensions from the Federal Reserve Board. We intend to seek the maximum extensions available to us, which could extend that deadline to July 2022.", "Now our comments on our 2014 outlook. Please note that this outlook is for the full year 2014 compared to the full year 2013. And in terms of balance sheet growth, we are looking at full year averages.", "Starting with average loans, we expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate from the mid to high teens. We have raised the top end of our range for this metric from what we originally provided to you in October. As noted earlier, a significant amount of our loan growth in the fourth quarter came during the last 3 weeks of 2013, particularly from private equity capital call lines of credit. Our outlook assumes that we will see some of these balances run off in the first quarter, as we saw last year at the same time. Nevertheless, borrowing activity remains very strong in Q1-to-date. If these balances remain high, we could experience higher loan growth in 2014 compared to our outlook.", "Moving on to average deposits. We expect average deposits to grow at a percentage rate in the mid teens. For net interest income, we expect percentage growth in the low teens. Net interest margin is expected to range between 3.2% and 3.3%. We expect credit quality to remain stable as well, with an allowance for loan losses for performing loans comparable to 2013 levels of 1.11%, net loan charge-offs between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans and non-performing loans comparable to 2013 levels of 47 basis points of total gross loans.", "We expect core fee income, as newly defined to include loan-related fees, to increase at a percentage rate in the low-double digits. And we expect non-interest expense to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-single digits, but recognize that this could change based on our performance.", "In closing, we delivered a very strong financial performance in 2013, meeting or exceeding virtually all of our outlook metrics. And thanks to our thriving and growing client base, we are optimistic about 2014. While the low rate environment and intense competition will undoubtedly remain challenges in the near term, we believe our continued focus on strong client acquisition and retention, high credit quality, effective balance sheet management and efficient growth will enable us to continue to deliver excellent results.", "Thank you. And now, we will be happy to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I'd like to start. Growth in the capital call business was really solid in the fourth quarter and for all 2013 for that matter. Could you give color on what's really underlying that growth and how much of it is coming from you growing the number of firms you're doing business with?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Steve. This is Greg. It's really -- there's really a couple of things going on there. One is that as we expand the definition of what we're going after, both in venture capital and in private equity, it's just a much bigger pool of companies that we're looking at. But let's talk specifically about private equity. Private equity is a much, much bigger market. The funds are larger, and they tend to borrow for, I would say, a little bit longer periods of time. So unlike what a venture capital firm may borrow a capital call loan for maybe a few weeks, private equity firm may borrow for 30 days, 60 days or 90 days. And obviously, given the size of these loans, that really can add up, and it becomes a lot stickier. So that's really what's driving the growth that we saw in the fourth quarter and, for that matter, for the whole year.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And maybe just to follow up on your comments around Volcker, it seems you're in good shape to comply so long as you get the extensions through 2022. I'm not expecting you're going to give us a comment whether or not you think you will get the extensions. But are there any obstacles we should be thinking about from our side that could be a factor in your ability to get those extensions?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Steve, this is Mike here. The rules just came out. And of course, everybody is still going through them, inclusive of the regulators and the Federal Reserve Board. So you would imagine that they're also putting together some guidelines. So whilst there are some criteria in the original rules on Volcker about the criteria for extension, the interpretation on how that actually will play on practice remains to be seen. So again, we'll continue to take a look at it. As we mentioned in our prepared comments, we will absolutely seek all maximum extensions. And to your point, if we get all the maximum extensions, we'd feel pretty good about the position we're in.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Mike, you talked about the Tier 1 leverage ratio of the bank falling to around 7%. Now I recognize it may be a little exaggerated because of some of the year-end window dressing. But can you remind us of how low you're comfortable in letting that ratio fall and some of the options you have to boost that without raising additional equity besides the FireEye gains, of course?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. Our capital levels, Joe, remain strong. Of course, as you saw, Q4 was just an extraordinary amount of asset growth there as well too. So certainly, it -- growth began to temper -- potentially temper going into this year here, obviously, earnings will be a great source to help continuing to build those capital levels as well. But if we continue to exhibit phenomenal growth, our deposit franchise continues to be strong, clearly, you'd have to look to take some other actions. And we certainly can do that and see that ratio go low. We still feel very comfortable considering the high quality equity we have, but you would certainly begin to perhaps incentivize sales forces to be thinking about how you can drive some of those deposits off to the balance sheet. And in certain cases, that's probably where a lot of those deposits belong. In this low rate environment, people tend to just put it on their bank's balance sheet. So you see that phenomena across the United States. The deposit levels are growing quite considerably. So as we went through the last time, when the leverage ratio dropped in the mid-6.5 range or somewhere around there, we still have a lot of levers that we can actually activate and pull and kind of incentivize the right behavior of moving certain deposits. So the last thing we want to do is raise debt or raise equity. So -- but again, I think we still got quite a bit of runway here in order to see how this plays out.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right. I understand. Okay. Yes. The other question is just this is the first period in a long time where you've actually built reserves. And again, I know part of that was the strong loan growth, but impaired loans did increase 40% off a low base, charge-offs doubled or so. Are these largely one-off issues? Or do you see some signs of stress emerging in the portfolio at all?", "Marc Cadieux", "Hello, Joe. It's Marc Cadieux, and the short answer is no. With regard to charge-offs, that was really primarily driven by 2 previously impaired accounts that are now fully behind us. And aside from that, 2/3 of charge-offs came from early stage, which is fairly typical for us, as you know. And so, there really wasn't anything from charge-offs that would be indicative of an emerging adverse trend. With regard to non-performing loans, the increase there and the increase in specific reserve is driven in the main by 1 loan that appears to be the occasional isolated event that, as a function of making larger loans, we'll have every now and again.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "On the growth in the rest of the loan book, outside of the capital call lines, particularly the growth in the software segment, can you give us a little bit of color, just what you're seeing there? And then, also, how much of the -- of your loan growth came out of M&A financing this quarter?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So, John, this is Greg. I'll start, and then I'll ask Marc Cadieux to add some commentary. So the -- a lot of the growth was driven by really 2 things, and you said one, Capital Call Loans is 1 driver; and the second driver was buyout financing. And as you have followed and many people have followed, that's been a driver of growth for quite a while. A lot of the buyout actually does come from software, which is why you see it ticking up. And I think it's really important to note, those buyouts are mainly for software companies that had a high dependence on recurring revenue. And we certainly believe that, that is a significant risk mitigator to the loans, given that they are larger loans, so we feel very good about that portfolio. But it is significantly software-driven in that buyout side. So, Marc?", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes. There's really nothing I would add. I think you said the highlights.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. So it doesn't imply that, at least, the loans in that segment are increasingly skewed towards the later stage companies?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, definitely. I mean, it's both later stage, it's high revenue. And again, buyout loans would tend to be on the larger side. But as I pointed out, knowing that they're software-related and they're recurring revenue is something we really look at from a quality perspective, and we believe that the larger loans that we're putting on the books are clearly higher quality.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, lastly, the decline in the NIM for the quarter, I appreciate the detail you gave, can you really just quantify how much in terms of basis points you would attribute as being a result of the higher excess liquidity in the quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "For the most part, John, it's -- most of it was driven by the liquidity. Any time you bring on $2 billion, $2.5 billion of deposits in a given quarter and given where Fed funds is, you initially part with the Fed funds earning only 25 basis points. That's going to drive a significant amount of that decrease. And if you look at the loan yields, as we mentioned in our prepared comments, loan yields held up relatively well. I mean, they were down about 6 basis points or so in the quarter, but again quite strong considering the low market rate environment.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Actually, my question has been answered. I just had one question for Greg. If -- there's been a lot of chatter in terms of whether you're seeing a bubble on the tech sector and whatnot, and I was wondering if you can comment in terms of -- obviously, your outlook seems fairly upbeat. And I'm just wanting to see if there are any specific areas where you pulled back or sort of put an increased focus in terms of underwriting when looking over the next 12 months? Or do you feel that we're still far away from being in any sort of a bubble scenario?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So, Ebrahim, I would say it a couple of different ways. And I'd just like to go back and reference the last time the market was, I would say, very robust, and that was back, in kind, of the 2000 time period. And if you go back to that time period, there was high valuations and there were business models, and there was almost a business model bubble and a valuation bubble. And clearly, from a risk perspective as a bank, it's the business model bubble that is what you're really concerned about because whether a valuation for a company is -- as long as the business model is good, maybe a $1 billion valuation is too high, maybe it's inflated and maybe the real valuation we would say is $500 million, that really doesn't impact the ability to repay that loan at all because the business model itself is what repays it. So, yes, I could say that the valuations are definitely at a high point. Whether they're too high or not, I think it is clearly dependent upon what sector you're looking at. But from a risk perspective, I'm more concerned about the business model, and I'd say the business models are incredibly strong right now. I've seen more disruption, more truly fundamental changes to the business model that I think have a lot of legs than I have seen in history. So I'm optimistic from that standpoint.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Got it. And just one quick question on Volcker. I understand investments -- correct me if I'm wrong, regardless of the extension or not, the earnings impact from the rule [indiscernible] exiting these funds should be none?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Well, it just depends. Obviously, we have our own equity invested in different funds. And to the extent that Volcker reduces or limits what you can invest, certainly, that will have an impact on your capital gains. But one important point is we still have an active funds investment business and our so-called SVB Capital segment, so we are still out there, raising funds and providing value to our clients as well and giving them access to some of the investments in the venture capital and private equity space. So we will still continue that business model. It's just you're going to have a less amount that you can actually invest with your own money in these different funds. So from that standpoint on the capital gains, potentially, it could. But again, as you've seen, we've just now recently over the last 18 months or so really started to see some nice significant gains starting to come out of those -- some of those investments. So -- but hopefully, that answers a little bit of your question there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Josh Levin from Citi.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "You've talked about your strategy. You're focusing more and more on your -- on larger clients, and that focus entails sacrificing some loan yield, but you're getting a big pickup in fee income. So when you think about it, given how your loan portfolio is evolving, if we would assume that Fed funds would go closer to normal to, say, 3%, 3.5%, what could we think about would be a normalized net interest margin for SVB?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "That's a good question, Josh. I mean, obviously, if the Fed funds was more normalized at 3%, 3.5%, I mean, that would be fantastic for our bank. Obviously, we're very, very much geared towards the shorter end rates, given the fact that 75% to 78% of our loans are tied to variable rates. As far as what that net interest margin would be, we do come out at the end of each quarter, and we'll give the updates on those impacts. But clearly, it will be very, very significant, again, primarily driven by the loan yield. Now the wildcard, of course, will be what your cost of funds does do when the rates go up. And again -- and that's more difficult to predict. There's an upcoming go-around about what we'll actually have to pay for deposits and things. But again, clearly, it's a very significant impact.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Josh, this is Greg. Just one more thing to add on to it. So in addition to what Mike said, the other benefit we would get from -- if Fed funds were about 325 basis points or higher is, right now, if you look at our off-balance sheet funds, which is substantial, because the rates are so low, we have -- we get very little margin on that for ourselves, very little fees compared to what our historical average is. And so, if rates go up, we'll be able to pick up some of the fees we would get. So there's definitely some leverage we could get in that side of the business as well. So there's several different places we would benefit from increasing rates.", "Josh Levin - Citigroup Inc, Research Division", "Okay. Things are going really well -- have been going really well for several quarters now. Can you see anything on the horizon that could derail the story? I mean, is there anything keeping you awake at night?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So we think a lot about this, and there are several things, right? So one is clearly the economy. Right now, the economy is on a slow but nice, I would say, trajectory. And clearly, if something were to derail in a significant way, it wouldn't take much from my standpoint and the economy is pretty fragile and we could have some challenges there, that's one. That's probably the biggest one. Competition, clearly, is one that we're keeping an eye on. And as you heard in my remarks, in Mike's remarks, we spend a lot of time figuring out how we can add more value to our clients and differentiate ourselves in a meaningful way. I think we've done a really good job of that, but we have to continue to do that. And the last part -- and the Volcker is a great example that, from a regulatory perspective, there's changes that are coming on a regular basis, and we don't know exactly what those regulatory changes will be. We assumed, I guess, I assumed, that Volcker -- we would be -- it would just be an automatic, where the extensions will be granted and we'd be willing -- we'd be open to winding down those investments over time. It's more of a risk that we may not get those extensions or it may be more challenging. Now we, again, hope we will, believe we will. But regulation is just one way that you just don't know what's out there.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "I just want to go back to the Volcker impact. If -- it's more a theoretical question, but if the Volcker will have been enforced today or in this quarter, what -- how much income would actually not have flowed through to the bottom line? I mean, meaning, is it the vast majority of your client investment -- or your gain on investment securities plus all your warrants? I'm just trying to get a sense of how much that $282 million that we're talking about that's allowed, actually contributed -- or contributes in general to earnings?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Ken, that's a really difficult question. Remember, Volcker does allow for you to invest in funds up to only 3% of the fund, so we'd have to go back and calculate that. So -- but again, we would still be able to recognize quite a fair amount. And here's the other reason to consider because part of the gains that we're reporting to today also included carry interest, right? And so, you may only own 3% of the fund, but you're still the general partner. And if the funds are performing well, you'll still be able to collect carried interest. And so, as we continue moving forward and we continue with our funds business, we're still going to be able to participate in carry. So I mean, I don't have the point of answer to you. But again, they -- we will still recognize some nice gains.", "Ken A. Zerbe - Morgan Stanley, Research Division", "Got it. Understood. And just in terms of FireEye, maybe just -- if you can remind us of your holding period? Because, obviously, it went public. I know you said that it's in lockup until March. But is it typical that on these IPOs that you hold for several more months? Because I guess I was under the impression that you sold a little more rapidly.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. So with FireEye and with -- quite common with the lot of the IPOs, in particular the high-profile ones, which we've been a part of. Typically, it's 180-day lockup. So to your point what you just mentioned, that would put us sometime towards the end of March that we -- that the lockup would expire. And then, of course, the teams will evaluate whether or not that's the right time to sell and how do you also do -- if you are going to sell, how do you do it in an orderly fashion as well, too, to kind of optimize and maximize your gains. So -- but again, that's still a decision to be made by the teams here in the future.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from Julianna Balicka from KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I have a couple of questions. One, on -- in your expense outlook for next year, expense growth, how much of that is coming from keeping up with front line revenue growth versus how much of the expense growth is coming from back office infrastructure, regulatory costs, et cetera?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Typically, roughly 60% or so of our costs come from compensation-related matters, and we have -- and the rest coming obviously from operations. And so, as you know, we've been investing quite heavily on the front line sales forces, particularly as we've growing our footprint. But at the same, we've also been investing heavily in the technology as well to make it easy to do business with us and to also help scale and make it a better client experience. And then, when you also add on top of that as well, given the fact that we've been going -- growing globally as well, too, building out the U.K. and building out China as well, too, clearly, those are so significant expenses. But again, by and large, the rule of thumb has been roughly about 60% related to, kind of, comp matters.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And so, that's not changing for the coming year now that you've made a significant...", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "No, not overly significant. It's pretty much in similar run rate.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, my other question is in your guidance, on your outlook for next year of NIM for 3.20% to 3.30% off your current NIM of 3.20%, if you can walk us through how you're getting to the increases. Because when I think about your loan growth guidance and your deposit growth guidance, that still creates a gap of -- if I just take the average 2013 balances and grow it by the midpoint, that creates a gap of roughly $1.2 billion or so of more deposits than loans, which would go into securities. And given the pressure on pricing, I'm just kind of wondering where the uptick in NIM will come from.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. I mean, in general, the uptick in the NIM is going to come primarily from the loan growth, and a lot of it also comes between the mix of where that loan growth is coming from. And so, if -- some of the healthy growth which we have seen in the past is coming from sponsor-led buyouts. Those tend to have much, much higher rates than our net interest margin. If they're just coming from the capital call lines, which -- those typically are probably roughly around our net interest margin. But again, in general, when you're adding a loan, that contributes significantly to increasing the net interest margin. And then, also, again, what -- depending on how you invest in the investment securities and how much cash you're keeping as well, too. Don't forget that as well. Deploying cash, moving it out of the 25 basis points to higher-yielding investment securities has also helped us. But again -- primarily, again, I'll just reiterate it, it comes primarily from the loan growth.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And what are the new loans pricing in that by category right now these days?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So it just depends. I mean, sponsor-led buyouts, you're probably looking at LIBOR plus 4.50% with a bit of a floor sometimes on 1%. Cap call lines are coming in somewhere around prime plus, prime minus depending on the quality of the deal as well. So they are all over the map there. But they haven't changed over -- significantly over, I would say, over the last 2 quarters. I mean, it's more or less still fairly consistent, but again notwithstanding the fact that it's still extremely competitive out there particularly for high-quality loans.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Gaston Ceron from Morningstar Equity Research.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I just have a question going back -- I'm sorry if I missed this, but going back to the deposit growth outlook. So correct me if I'm wrong. But I guess, when I looked at what your guidance had been for 2013, I think you guys said, like, obviously, you ended up sort of performing than, I think, your guidance had -- I think as of the third quarter had been for average deposit balances in 2013 to increase in the mid-single digits and forget exactly how you ended up, but you ended up above that. And so, obviously -- and then, for this coming year, it seems like you're going right out of the gate and just saying something -- it doesn't feel like you're being as conservative as you were this past year, like, you're a lot more confident. It seems like you're a lot more confident from the get-go on growing at that rate. I mean, granted you had a pretty nice finish with end-of-year deposit balances, but I'm just curious just how you see sort of the deposit story playing out over the longer term.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I think you answered your question. You're right on to the right point, which is we finished the year extremely strong. And if you remember in some of our comments as well, we said that lot -- most of the growth we had in 2013 came in that second half of the year. So now, you're going to have all that growth in the full year 2014. So that's why we feel pretty good about the deposit outlook, assuming the economy continues to hold. And as you see with the period-end deposit balances, they're quite elevated and quite strong. And so, as long as they don't temper or fall off or remain flat like they did last year, we're going to continue to see some strong deposit growth. And hence, they're reflected in our outlook numbers.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "And then, finally, as a follow-up on the same subject, I mean, how sticky do you see the deposit base, sort of, behaving as the rate environment changes and that sort of thing?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "That's a really good question. I'm sure a lot of bankers across the United States are going to try to figure out what happened. They will probably remain sticky if rates remain low. Now if rates start to move up, they will probably start to try to migrate to yielding instruments. And so, it's going to become a decision for banks to decide, \"Do I need to keep these deposits on the balance sheet? If I do, then I'm going to probably have to pay up to keep them on the balance sheet.\" Now it probably won't happen with the first 25 or 50 basis point move and might start to get a little bit more difficult to keep deposits on when you start to see 75 or 100 basis points. But from us, we're prepared either way. If the deposit is going to stay on the balance sheet, we can certainly benefit. If they do migrate off the balance sheet, we have plenty of liquidity to handle that, it will move into our off-balance sheet funds. We'll get a fee on that if they also move into off-balance sheet funds. So we're very well positioned. And even if it does move off the balance sheet, it does free up a fair amount of capital as well, too. So it just creates a lot of flexibility for us. So -- but again, it's really going to come down to that consumers -- or that customer's decision, and that's really difficult to predict at the moment.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. Greg Becker, I'll turn the call back over to you.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thank you. So before we sign off, I just want to say a word of thanks to all our employees and clients for making 2013, which was our 30th anniversary, our best year in our history. We say this a lot, which is we certainly believe we have the best employees and the best clients. And with all our success, our commitment to our clients' success hasn't changed. It's the most important thing for all of us. We feel really good about the start of 2014 and are looking forward to a great, great year as well.

[Operator Instructions] Thank you.", "Meghan O'Leary, you may now begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Ian, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our first quarter 2014 results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "I will caution you that we will be making forward-looking statements during this call and that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. This disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "[Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Thanks, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. The first quarter was an outstanding start to the year. We delivered healthy growth in the core bank, maintained high credit quality and recognized significant gains on our venture capital and private equity-related investments.", "In the first quarter, SVB recorded our highest-ever net income of $91.3 million and earnings per share of $1.95. These results reflect, for the first quarter, 6.2% average loan growth, primarily driven by capital call loans; 6.5% average total client funds growth, that is deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds, due to a strong funding environment and new client acquisition; 4% core fee income growth, as a result of new client acquisition and effective cross-selling; and strong gains on equity warrants and investment securities, driven by strong exits in public and private market valuations.", "We are performing well, thanks to our own effective execution in a strong business environment for our clients, especially for funding, valuations and exits. We saw continued healthy funding of new companies in the first quarter and that activity is continuing.", "In the first quarter of 2014, venture capitalists invested $9.5 billion in 951 deals, the highest quarterly dollar amount since the second quarter of 2001. In addition to strong VC funding in the first quarter, we've also seen an expansion over time in the sources of capital available to high-growth companies. While traditional VCs remain a key source of startup funding, VCs in recent years have focused more on mid- and later-stage companies. Angel and seed investors have filled the void in funding very early-stage companies.", "At the same time, corporate venture funds and investors, which pulled back significantly during the economic crisis, have been reemerging to support new company formation. These corporate funds essentially provide research and development arms for mature companies trying to avoid disruption by startups with new technologies and delivery mechanisms. And in a testament to how pervasive technology has become, corporate venture funds are sponsored not just by technology companies, but by entertainment, auto, apparel, retail, financial and consumer product companies.", "Innovation is now very much part of the mainstream and that is increasing the size of our target market. Together, by some estimates, these alternative sources of innovation capital are now providing us as much funding to U.S. startups as traditional venture capital firms. And we believe they will eventually surpass VCs in funding activity.", "Just as we have teams dedicated to venture and private equity, we also have teams dedicated to working with these emerging providers of capital. New sources of funding, combined with the declining cost of starting and growing innovation companies, are helping to fuel a high pace of new company formation, and that is contributing to strong client acquisition for SVB.", "In the first quarter of 2014, we added more than 1,000 new clients, a run rate 10% higher than in 2013. The majority of these new clients were early-stage companies, but we saw significant increases in private equity, private bank and global client counts as well.", "The pace of new company formation has also been helped by healthy exit markets. There were 105 venture-backed M&A deals in the first quarter of 2014, with average valuations more than double what they were a year ago.", "In addition, there were 34 IPOs of venture-backed technology and life science companies, more than 3x the number during the same quarter last year and the strongest quarter for new listings since 2000. The fact that 59% of these IPOs were SVB clients, speaks to our success at working with the best innovation companies in the market and keeping those clients longer.", "Our investments in people, products, services, global capabilities are contributing to our improving client retention rate, and they continue to generate growth in cross-selling opportunities across all aspects of our business.", "Let me share a few of the many metrics that we track. Loans to global clients were up 82% year-over-year. Payment and card revenue increased 38% year-over-year. FX dollar volumes increased 17% year-over-year, and our private bank client count increased 24% year-over-year.", "We remain very focused on our efforts to generate this kind of growth, even without the help from interest rates. But although interest rate increases appear to be at least a year away, based on our current performance and balance sheet growth, we expect to benefit significantly from raising -- from rising rates when they come. Consider the 78% of our loan book that's tied to short-term rates; while that percentage has increased somewhat in the last 5 years, the size of our loan book has more than doubled to almost $11 billion.", "Over the same 5-year period, our deposits have grown by 116% to $24 billion, 2/3 of which is noninterest bearing, and deposit growth has only accelerated as a result of the increased funding sources and strong new client acquisition I mentioned earlier.", "Mike will talk in a few minutes about how we're thinking about deposit growth and capital, but the long-term earnings potential of this huge low-cost funding base in a rising rate environment is significant.", "Finally, we have $27 billion in off-balance sheet client investment funds, which we expect will generate significant fees when the rates rise, all the more so because we would expect to see these balances grow in a rising rate environment.", "Although higher rates are a long-term opportunity, they remain one of our major challenges in the short term. While we have demonstrated that we are able to deliver strong organic growth without help from rates, our earnings power is nevertheless constrained by the current rate environment.", "We face other challenges as well. The cost of being regulated continues to rise and new regulations around the world require us to constantly adapt and reevaluate our business activities.", "Competition remains intense and shows no signs of letting up. Some lenders appear to be stretching for growth at any cost, and we're seeing more situations where we have to decide whether it makes sense to sharpen our pencils or walk away.", "Finally, we're keeping a close eye on valuations. The markets are hot. In our experience, a certain amount of frothiness is expected to be in any hot market. We take some comfort in the fact that the lessons of the dot-com era have significantly raised the bar in business models and IPO readiness. We believe the pre-IPO companies in the market today generally have much stronger business models than the pre-IPO companies we saw 15 years ago, and many of the valuations are justified. While we have a long history of working with hot markets and we have taken the lessons we've learned to heart, in particular, we had learned to take a measured approach when things are heating up.", "In closing, we are pleased with our results in the first quarter and our ongoing performance. We've delivered outstanding results, grown our client base and executed effectively. And as Mike will detail you -- with you in a few minutes, we are raising our full year 2014 expectations for loan and deposit growth, as well as net interest income and core fee income.", "While we recognize the challenges facing us, we have the advantage of a thriving client base, significant value-add beyond products and the best people in the industry. We remain optimistic about the year ahead and the improving economy.", "Thank you. And now, we'll turn it over to Michael Descheneaux who will talk about our financial results.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg, and thank you all for joining us. We had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by strong growth in revenue and gains from venture capital-related investments. Our results were driven by healthy funding environment for our clients and robust client acquisition.", "I would like to call on a few highlights, which I will cover in more detail shortly: First, strong average loan growth; second, exceptional growth in total client funds, which includes on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds; third, higher net interest income, despite a lower net interest margin; fourth, excellent credit quality; fifth, significant gains from our private equity and venture capital-related investment securities and warrants; and sixth, solid growth in foreign exchange fees and card fees. Additionally, I will comment on expenses and our capital levels, as well as changes to our 2014 outlook.", "Let me start with loan growth. Average loans grew by $630 million or 6.2% to $10.8 billion during the first quarter. This growth was driven primarily by private equity capital call lines of credit, as well as by our growth in corporate finance clients. Period-end loan balances were relatively flat as expected and ended at $10.8 billion compared to $10.9 billion in the fourth quarter due to pay-downs of short-term capital call lines of credit, following a significant increase at the end of Q4.", "Moving to total client funds. Average total client funds increased by $3.1 billion or 6.5% to $50.8 billion during the first quarter, an all-time high, driven by a strong funding environment for startups and our continued success at winning new clients.", "The increase in average total client funds reflects significant growth in average deposit balances of $2.2 billion or 10.2% to $23.7 billion, primarily from our Accelerator and Growth-stage clients. We also saw an increase in average off-balance sheet client investment funds of $910 million or 3.4% to $27.1 billion, primarily driven by continued growth in our client funds managed by SVB Asset Management.", "Moving to net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $9.3 million or 5% to $196.8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to increases in investment securities and loans. Average available-for-sale securities balances increased by $1.2 billion or 11% to $12.2 billion, driven by higher deposit balances, resulting in an increase of $8.3 million in interest income. The yield on our AFS portfolio increased by 13 basis points in the first quarter due to lower premium amortization expense and the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter. Overall yields on our AFS portfolio during the first quarter were 1.81% compared to 1.68% in the fourth quarter.", "Interest income from loans increased by $1.2 million to $148.2 million. This increase reflects the positive impact of higher average loan balances and was offset by the impact of 2 fewer days in the first quarter, as well as lower loan yields. Loan yields declined due to competition and a changing loan mix as a result of continued strong growth in capital call lines of credit. Overall loan yields for the first quarter were 5.58% compared to 5.75% in the prior quarter.", "Our net interest margin was 3.13% compared to 3.2% in the fourth quarter. The decline was primarily due to the increases in investment securities, which was helped by significant increase in average deposits.", "Moving on to credit quality. It was excellent during the first quarter, marked by improvements in impaired balances and a reduction in classified loans. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $494,000 versus a provision of $28.7 million in the fourth quarter. The loan-loss provision reflects net charge-offs of $19.8 million and the release of reserves related to the resolution of several loans, for which reserves were established in prior periods. Additionally, the loan-loss provision reflects an overall reserve release of $4.8 million due to an improvement in the overall credit call quality -- credit -- sorry, overall credit quality of performing loans.", "Our allowance for loan losses for total gross performing loans decreased 4 basis points to 1.07%, driven by continued strong performance of our performing loan portfolio. Nonperforming loans decreased $27 million to $25 million, reflecting $22 million in repayments. Classified loans decreased by 16%, primarily due to the resolution of certain nonperforming and performing loans, early-stage clients receiving follow-on funding rounds and the improved operating performance of certain later-stage companies.", "Now let us move on to noninterest income. We continue to benefit from strong gains on private equity and venture capital-related investment securities and warrants. These gains stemmed from healthy IPO and venture-backed funding markets, as well as increasing public market valuations. As a result of these factors, non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interests, was $123.5 million in the first quarter compared to $100.9 million in the fourth quarter.", "Investment securities gains, net of noncontrolling interests, were $37.4 million compared to $26.1 million in the fourth quarter and were driven by evaluation increases in our investment funds related to companies that went public during the last 3 quarters.", "Gains on equity warrants were exceptionally strong as well at $25.4 million compared to $16.6 million in the fourth quarter. These gains were primarily related to gains on our exercise of equity warrant assets and valuation increases in our nonmarketable securities due to IPO and M&A activity.", "The securities we hold in FireEye were the largest driver of gains in the first quarter. It is important to note that FireEye will also impact our second quarter results, as we held investment positions in FireEye as of March 31. I will refer you to our press release for specific details, but the summarized version is as follows: One, we recognized a $21.8 million gain, net of noncontrolling interests, on our funds that held FireEye shares; two, we recognized a $15.2 million gain when we exercised our equity warrants in FireEye and converted them into shares; but the last point we have to note is the decline in the FireEye share prices, subsequent to the exercise of the warrants and conversion into shares, resulted in the recognition of an $8.2 million unrealized loss in equity. This loss is recorded in other comprehensive income. The value of these holdings will continue to be subject to changes in FireEye's stock price until we dispose of them.", "Based on the decrease in FireEye's common stock as of April 23, we would expect a decrease in the valuation of our warrant-related shares of approximately $13 million and a decrease in valuation of the shares held by investment funds of approximately $48 million or $9 million, net of noncontrolling interests.", "Now moving to core fee income. It remained healthy, increasing by $2 million or 4% in the first quarter to $50.9 million, primarily driven by foreign exchange in credit cards. As a reminder, in addition to foreign exchange and credit cards, core fee income includes deposit service charges, lending-related fees, letters of credit and client investment fees. Foreign exchange fees increased by $1.3 million or 8% to $17.2 million, due to increased activity across all client segments and higher client counts. Credit card fees grew by $1.1 million or 12% to $10.3 million, also due to higher transaction volumes related to increased use of our cards by our clients.", "Turning to expenses. Noninterest expense increased by $3.5 million or 2.1% to $172.4 million in the first quarter. This increase was driven primarily by an increase of $6 million in compensation and benefits cost due to higher FTE, as well as seasonal 401(k) contributions tied to annual incentive compensation payouts in the first quarter. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in professional services expense of $2.2 million. Given that we are starting the year off with such a strong performance overall, we expect high incentive compensation to remain a factor in expense growth.", "Moving on to capital. Our capital ratios remained solid overall in the first quarter, with our risk-based capital ratios increasing at both the consolidated and bank levels. However, our leverage ratios declined due to exceptionally strong deposit growth. Specifically, our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio declined 32 basis points to 6.72%.", "As we have said in the past, our target Tier 1 leverage ratio is generally around the 7% to 8% range. As a result, we are closely monitoring our Tier 1 leverage ratio, especially in light of our expanding markets, strong new client acquisition and growth of total client funds over the last 3 quarters, as well as the last several years. Although our earnings remain strong, Tier 1 leverage could continue to trend down if the extraordinary deposit growth continues and if we do not take action.", "We have grown deposits $6.8 billion or 36% over the last 3 quarters. We expect deposit growth to continue and to be robust for the second quarter and likely the remainder of 2014. We are looking at the range of options available to us to increase our Tier 1 leverage ratio to our targeted levels, which includes raising equity or debt or both at the holding company to support our growth.", "Now I will turn to our outlook for the full year 2014. We are improving our overall outlook and adjusting our ranges on several business drivers. We are narrowing our outlook for average loan growth based on strong first quarter performance. We expect average loans to increase at a percentage rate in the high teens, which is at the top end of the range we previously provided of mid to high teens.", "We are increasing our outlook for average deposit growth based on our exceptional performance in the first quarter. We expect deposits to increase a percentage rate in the high 20s, which is significantly higher than our previous outlook of mid-teens growth.", "We expect this higher deposit growth to have a ripple effect on net interest income and net interest margin. As a result, we are increasing our outlook for net interest income based on the expectation that deposits deployed in our loan and available-for-sale securities portfolios will drive higher interest income. We expect net interest income to increase at a percentage rate in the high teens compared to our previous outlook of the low teens.", "We are lowering our outlook for net interest margin to a range of 3.1% to 3.2%, which is down from our previous outlook of 3.2% to 3.3%. This change is based on our expectation that higher deposit growth will pressure our net interest margin.", "We are increasing our outlook for core fee income due to strong client activity. We expect core fee income to increase at a percentage rate in the low teens versus our previous outlook of low double digits.", "And finally, we are increasing our outlook for expenses as a result of higher incentive compensation due to our strong performance in the first quarter and improved overall expectations. We expect expenses to increase at a percentage rate in the low double digits versus our previous outlook of mid-single digit growth. If we were to exclude higher incentive compensation due to our performance, expenses would most likely be in line with our original outlook.", "Clearly, we are off to a very strong start in 2014. We delivered healthy growth; and in almost every respect, we are on track to exceed our initial performance expectations for 2014. Growth in the technology sector, healthy investment and exit markets for our clients and our own continued solid execution are driving a healthy pipeline and continued expansion of our business.", "Notwithstanding the challenges of intense competition, the persistent low rate environment and some market frothiness, we are very pleased with our performance in the first quarter and our expectations for the year remain high. Thank you.", "And now, I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And your first question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Merrill Lynch.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Mike, just going back to your comments around the leverage ratio and the possibility of looking at a common or debt combo to raise there, it seemed like you guys, in general, have been reluctant to go that route, especially in terms of raising common. I'm just wondering, given sort of a relatively strong outlook on balance sheet growth, what would drive that decision as we move forward over the next few months or in the next couple of quarters to go for it or not?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "We give you -- as we pointed out, we've grown the deposits so significant, right. And a lot of the actions we've been taking internally as well to try to deal with the deposit growth as well is just really, really difficult in this low-rate environment. And so we continue to monitor and look at our different options. So we'll continue to assess the situation and the market conditions and then make a final decision on when we may do this.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "Good. And Mike, as a separate question in terms of, obviously, there's been a lot of chatter and volatility around high-growth stocks and Greg referred to that in his opening remarks. I'm just wondering in terms of when you look at your outlook, and it's much difficult for us from the outside, in terms of the visibility that you have, how do you see the downside risk to your sort of 2014 forecast because of what we've seen in the markets over the last few weeks in terms of some of the IPOs not going through or not pricing where they had to in terms of the exit markets getting a little tighter? How does that impact your fundamental outlook on balance sheet NII growth?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Ebrahim, this is Greg. Let me start, and then I'll -- Mike comment as well. So I'll take the question from the perspective of growth in total client funds and the loan outlook, and then maybe Mike can comment on the securities portfolio, the warrants and securities gains and how that could be impacted. Look, where we are right now, and part of the answer to your first question, which is why have we changed possibly in how we think about maybe raising capital or debt or equity, and it's really because into the fourth quarter and in all the way through the first quarter and as I made in my comments, we've continued to see substantial growth in deposits, new client formation, new company formation, new client additions. And so that has really driven our view that this capital, this new liquidity is happening at such a pace that we really need to consider other alternatives to bolster up our capital ratios. So we think that's going to be continuing. So if the market start to correct, the stock market turns down and the sources of capital I talked about putting more money into the market starts to pull back, clearly that would slow down deposit growth. But again, we still expect it to be a very robust market out there. So I don't view either for loans or deposits a substantial change in the outlook if the market corrects a little bit. In fact, I think it actually would be healthy for the long run. Maybe, Mike, you can comment on the security side.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. I think it's pretty much the same answer correlated to it. As you know, the value of warrants in our investment is really highly correlated to the markets as well in the valuation, so they all relate off of that. So that wouldn't add anything else to that.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "On the outlook, the loan growth outlook and deposit growth for that matter as well, can you just kind of give us some more granularity on each? What changed from January? I know you keep citing the stronger-than-expected deposit growth, for example, during the quarter. But what really changed in the 3 months that you saw a much bigger inflow of deposits than you had projected at that time, for example?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. John, this is Greg. Let me start. So towards the end of the fourth quarter, we did see a nice tick -- uptick in deposits. And there's 2 -- and that carried -- as I said, carried through in the first quarter. There's 2 aspects of it. First of all, about 20% roughly of the new total client -- the total client funds of growth has come from new client acquisition, and about 80% of that is existing clients that have raised additional rounds of equity. What's been happening in the market is these companies are performing at a very strong level, and they're getting this preemptive rounds that are substantial; $50 million, $60 million, $75 million. We thought that, that would be potentially temporary, and we thought that would slow down some time in the first quarter. We're not seeing that. And so you look at the size of the rounds and you look at the new client acquisition, the combination of those 2 factors is causing us to feel very good about the outlook, which is why we raised the outlook for the balance of the year. The same holds true from a lending perspective, with the only caveat being that, as we said, the market is very intense from a competitive standpoint. And although we have better products and services than we ever have, the market's growing, we still have to take that into consideration when we want to sharpen our pencils, as I said, or walk away. So we've increased the outlook, but I'd say we're more cautious on that side.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right, that's really helpful. And then, on that competitive point, Greg, can you talk about -- are you seeing an increasing number of your early stage competitors that are not taking warrants on new originations? And do you think that could be an issue for you, that kind of starts to develop from here?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. From a competitive standpoint, again, I'd say let me start with the positive parts about the market that we're going after. First of all, the market that we're going after, this whole innovation economy is growing at an incredibly fast pace. So we're not all fighting for the same share of market. The market itself is growing at a very fast pace, so that's one really positive part. Second part is, for us specifically, over the last 2, 3, 4 years, our credit product set has expanded significantly. When you look at mezzanine debt, expanding our various flavors of asset-based lending, so we can compete more broadly than we ever have been able to, and we could add a lot more value. So I think our ability to compete in the market is better than it ever has been. Now to your point about competitors; clearly, there are more competitors: It's large banks; it's small banks; it's venture debt funds. And as we've seen in other markets -- or other cycles, I should say, you do see people pushing the envelope. So we do see some companies looking for non-warrant deals in situations where we think there should be one. When that happens, clearly, we think it's temporary, and we think that, that isn't priced effectively, not being priced effectively for the risk that they're taking. And we've seen people cycle in and out of the markets when they go down that path. So from our standpoint, it's not prudent to head down that path because we believe you -- and you've paid for the risk and we feel good about where we stand in the market right now.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Joe Morford at RBC Capital.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess I was curious if you could talk a little bit more on the loan side. Obviously, the end period, as expected, was fairly flat, yet you raised your guidance, suggesting the pipeline is building. And I was just wondering if you could talk about the kind of mix of growth you expect going forward relative to capital call lines or buyout financing. And you talk about more clients doing financing, so the bigger ones with that. Is that on some level actually tempering loan demand? Or on the flipside, is it just that VCs are making more investment and that's more a call round or a call line that's needed and things like that?", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Joe, it's Marc Cadieux. So maybe starting in reverse order, I think the higher activity levels, and we saw some of that in the first quarter with the number of investments made, does translate to more activity on our capital call lending and you see that reflected in our numbers. I think going back to the front end of your question, the -- your suspicion's right on the money. I think we are seeing continued demand in the -- I'll call it the better credit quality segments, so capital call lending, sponsor-led buyout lending, and also loan demand in our private bank as well are continuing to give us confidence that the loan growth that we're hoping for is going to be there throughout 2014.", "Gregory W. Becker", "And Joe, this is Greg. The only thing I would add on to it from a growth perspective, as I had said in my comments, the global loan portfolio grew roughly 82% year-over-year. It's roughly $850 million right now. So when you think about the growth rate and the size of that portfolio now, if that growth rate -- it won't continue at that pace, but let's say if it goes 30% or 40%, it's still a substantial contribution to the overall growth. So as we've said in prior calls, the growth portfolio is very broad: It's buyout; it's capital call lending; it's the private bank; it's global; it's much more broad than just one area, which is why we feel good about the outlook. But the outlook increase was mainly driven by the higher average loans starting in the first quarter and that obviously carries through throughout the year.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "Right, okay. And then the other question, I guess, for Mike on the growth in the investment portfolio, also looks like cash balances were up quite a bit. I just wonder; is there still some remixing that can be done either from cash or securities or investing in higher-yielding securities that can maybe help support your margin going forward at all?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Joe, it's a bit of a tough dilemma, right. Because the larger your securities portfolios gets, the more sensible you need to be on as far as duration and avoiding duration extension risk. So we're right now probably around a 3.2, 3.3 year of duration on the investment securities portfolio, and we'd like to try to keep that tight and keep that in and perhaps, even maybe bringing in a little bit. Because, again, when you look at the size of the investment securities portfolio in relation to the proportion of the balance sheet, it's obviously significant. So we would probably expect to start -- we've been buying U.S. treasuries lately. So we've been kind of targeting an average duration somewhere around 3.25 years. Now obviously, the yields on those are significantly lower. But we're probably looking around 100, 110, say 1.1% interest. So it is actually lower than our current overall yield of 180. But overall, clearly, it's going to drive net interest income higher.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos at JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "I wanted to start with the loan growth guidance. If we look at the average first quarter balance, you're already 15% above the 2013 average and the guidance says for high teens, right? So it implies maybe 2% or 3% additional growth for the year. Why is the loan forecast so low? Do you expect the average to fall, given period end was down in 2Q and then bounced back up for the rest of the year?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. Steve, let me start and then Marc may want to add. So we raised -- we kind of tightened the range. But obviously, we moved towards the higher end of that based on the first quarter average. As we said in the last earnings call, I'd say we're looking at where that growth rate is and basically saying that with the both competitive landscape and how we look at the market, we're, I'd say, being a little more cautious as far as how we look at that outlook. Obviously, if the second quarter comes in and that momentum continues, we'll be raising guidance in the second part of the quarter. But I'd say, just being a little more cautious in looking at that outlook, given where the competitive landscape is right now, is kind of how we positioned it.", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Yes. I think that's, your last point, the point I would have made. The frequency with which we'll lean in versus walking away likely goes up if the competitive environment remains what it is.", "Gregory W. Becker", "And maybe one more last point, Steve, on that. One of the things we've grown significantly over the last 3 or 4 years is our buyout portfolio. And if you look at the level of refinancings that we've had in the buyout [ph] portfolio over the last few years, it's actually been relatively few. We're starting to see more refinancings in the portfolio, mainly because of the competitive landscape. And so we haven't wanted to chase EBITDA multiples to a bad place or, in some cases, one of the price deals where we think they're inappropriate from a risk-reward perspective. So we have -- probably see, in that portfolio, a little more churn and not as much growth as we've seen in prior quarters.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And I just wanted to follow up on the comments on the leverage ratio. How low will you let that level go before you do pull the trigger on a capital action? And if there was equity, do you have a preference for common or preferred?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Steve, this is Mike here. So as we pointed out, we're generally trying to target the 7% to 8%. And it really is just a question on trends and where that's heading. And so we -- obviously, we have forecasts and outlook and looking at it. So it just wouldn't be become -- we continue to digest information and understanding the trends in the growth and we'll make a decision on where to proceed from there.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. Mike, any commentary on preferred versus common?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "No, no commentary.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin from Sterne Agee.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to ask you, Greg, you mentioned a couple of times, \"some market frothiness\" and was just curious if you could maybe walk us through, specifically, what you're seeing in terms of the markets that are too frothy and what you might be avoiding, either in tech or life sciences as a result of that \"frothiness\"?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So Brett, thinking about frothiness, we get questioned a lot about the -- whether we're in a bubble and what does that look like. And I think it's really important, first and foremost, to talk about why this is different than the dot-com bubble back in -- 15 years ago. And back at that time period, there were really 2 things going on: one is the business models themselves were -- weak business model is probably the simple way to describe it and then you had high valuations on top of that. And so you have a recipe, when one fell, they both collapsed kind of at the same time. Today, what you see is incredibly sound business models. I -- when I talk to venture capitalists I look in our own portfolio, you meet with CEOs, there's more disruption going on in traditional businesses than any of us have ever seen. Now the question is what's the value of these disruptive businesses and these growth rates? And so the valuations that we're seeing, which are, in some cases, billions of dollars in a private basis, I would argue, are justified. Now the question is when you see multiples of these companies in similar industries, all getting high valuations, they can't all be successful. So it's hard for us to predict which ones are going to be successful and which ones aren't going to be successful. But it is kind of just a general frothiness that we're looking at. But again, the business models themselves are much more sound. So what happens there? From a credit perspective, I look at it and say the valuations are less of an issue than the business models themselves. Because it just means they'll still be able to raise money, but the valuation may not be at $1 billion, maybe they raise money at $300 million or $400 million or maybe $200 million. So as we look at it, could it slow down client funds? Possibly. We're really watching it more so right now from a credit perspective, and we feel good about where we are, again, going back to the quality of the business models.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And I guess the other thing I wanted to ask was just around competition. You mentioned increased competition. Would you say loan spreads have tightened more dramatically in the past quarter than they did perhaps last year in any of the larger pieces of the portfolio? Or how would you describe that?", "Gregory W. Becker", "I think -- I wouldn't say it's changed from the trend line that we have seen back in 2013. And when you look at our loan margin, there's really a few things going on. First, a part of it is loan mix. When you look at the growth we've had in the portfolio, it's mainly been, over the last few years, capital call loans, some private bank loans, some sponsored buyout loans and corporate finance. Those tend to be of higher-quality loans, which command lower rates, right. It's part of the reason why our loan loss reserve against performing loans has continued to decline as well. So you can look at that in one context; a part of that is mix. Second part of it absolutely has to do with the competitive landscape, but I wouldn't say that it is -- has gotten more intense this quarter. It's kind of a continuation of the trend that we have seen -- or that we saw back in 2013.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of David Long at Raymond James.", "David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "Looking at the guidance that you gave on FireEye for the quarter, you said that there was a $22 million impact, $9 million from the noncontrolling interests or net of the noncontrolling interests from the securities and that warrant-converted shares was $13 million. Are you saying that, that $22 million will be a negative for the quarter and for the securities? And then the reason why I'm asking is the -- I thought the warrant-converted shares at 3/31 were already down $8 million of that $13 million.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So maybe just -- I mean, the clearest way to see it and read it is obviously in our press release. I think we were laying it out, but let's just walk through it real quick. What we said is, in the quarter, we recognized $21.8 million in gains on our funds, okay? Those are obviously at fair value mark as of 3/31. Now I guess a little bit more depth -- in depth of a discussion is we recognized a $15.2 million gain on the exercise of the warrant. But subsequent to the date of the exercise of the warrant, the price of the shares had gone down. And the way the accounting works is you actually recognize that in the other comprehensive income section, which is the reduction of equity. So -- and that was $8 million. So it depends on how you look at it. GAAP doesn't look at it necessarily this way, but you would take the $15.2 million gain on the exercise, less the $8 million to kind of give you that mark as of 3/31, which obviously, the net of $15 million and the $8 million, it gives you around $7 million. So then you have to look at what's happened since March 31, and again, that's -- we've put a disclosure in there as well. Subsequent to March 31, the value of FireEye has actually declined as well, and so we provide those numbers for you as well.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka from KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "In terms of -- so a lot of my questions have been covered, but a couple of housekeeping questions. One, on the loan losses, the 80 basis points and then you mentioned in your remarks that your performing allowance is decreasing because of the mix shift of loans. But in terms of just kind of the loan loss history impacting your forward-looking reserve requirements, is this something that we need to start thinking about, this 80 basis points of charge-offs pushing forward your reserves in the future? Because I mean, you did say that the charge-offs were already previously covered. So how should we think about that kind of from an allowance methodology perspective?", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Julianna, it's Marc Cadieux. So the 80 basis points, I think you're getting there by annualizing the first quarter gross charge-offs, yes?", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Yes.", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Yes. And so the way to think about the first quarter charge-offs is we had a larger loan in the fourth quarter that we impaired. And in the first quarter, we had an opportunity to resolve that one loan. And I think, as we said before, we occasionally will have those larger loans come along. And thankfully, they are an occasional thing and not a regular thing. So we had an opportunity to resolve it in the first quarter. In connection with resolving it, we did take a charge-off in order to put that situation largely behind us, which we thought was a good thing to do. If you separate that out, it was a typical quarter, I would say, in terms of charge-off activity and that was both from an amount and also from a loan portfolio segment standpoint in that it was all early stage. And so I don't expect the 80 basis points to be what we delivered and rather are sticking with our guidance of the plus or minus 40 basis points.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And from the perspective of 8 to 12 methodology, that 80 basis points recognized loss once upon a time will not push your reserves up higher than they've already been trending, right?", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Correct.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay, and then the other question I wanted to ask you, in your remarks, you mentioned the 20% of [indiscernible] your new client acquisition. This quarter, 80% came from clients already in place, and I believe this was in reference to deposit growth, and 20% came from new clients. The 20% of new clients, did that come from early-stage, extension-stage, later-stage clients? Could you give us a little bit more color on that 20%, please?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. Julianna, this is Greg. And those new clients, again, mainly are in our Accelerator and Growth, so kind of early and mid-stage, and that's where the vast majority of these deposits and total client funds came from.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Great. And then final housekeeping question, kind of going back to the capital questions that had been asked earlier in the call. You didn't want to comment between preferred versus common, but could you comment in terms of your thoughts at the whole co level raising debt versus actually going out and raising a form of equity?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. Julianna, as we said in the prepared remarks, we will consider the options. It's either debts, it's either equity or a combination of both. If we do decide that that's a route we want to pursue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Gaston Ceron from Morningstar.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "I just got a quick question, going back to the issue of competition. As the space continues to attract interest and perhaps you see some rising competition, maybe not just granularly looking at this past quarter, but just in general over the last, I don't know, couple of years. I mean I'm curious; has that had an effect on your ability to recruit and retain sort of the talent that I believe at least gives you part of your edge here? These folks that have strong networks or have relationships with the markets that you're targeting, or no, are you still finding it relatively straightforward to attract and retain this banking talent?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So Gaston, this is Greg. I'll start and I'll hopefully won't jinx my -- jinx where we are by saying this, but we've been very fortunate to retain a significant number of our key employees. And what we look at is we have literally hundreds of people inside the organization. This is what we have been doing for a long period of time. There is no question that periodically we're going to lose 1, 2, 3 people to competitors because, again, if you were a competitor, this is the place where you would end up coming to look for that talent. But so much of what we do is about culture. It's about opportunities, it's about the platform that we have and making sure that we pay competitively and all the other things that you would talk about from being able to retain employees. And I think we've done a good job of that. It doesn't mean we can't get better at it, but we've done a good job. And again, we retained -- we've retained really well.", "Gaston F. Ceron - Morningstar Inc., Research Division", "Okay, that sounds great. And then, just very quickly, maybe just one last sling at the thoughts -- at thoughts on a capital action. I mean, is that something that you foresee as a possible decision that you might have to make in the near term or is it something further out? Or it's just hard to say on timing.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. I mean all we can really say is we just continue to evaluate it. I mean you see the trends where we're at and how strong the deposit growth has been and so, obviously, we mentioned we want to have that target of 7% to 8%. So again, we just continue to monitor very closely.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Just one question on the -- well, this kind of ties in with the capital question, but with the deposit growth really driving some of those pressures, are there additional strategies that you can take to help persuade some of your client funds to move from deposits into off-balance sheet products?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So Aaron, I'll start and then maybe Mike will comment as well. It's really tough right now. And again, it starts with you have to do the right thing for the client, and that's the first and foremost most important thing. When you look at this, as I said in my comments, again, 2/3 of our deposits, they're sitting in noninterest-bearing accounts, right. So they're earning 0. And when you look at the alternatives off our balance sheet, from the investment perspective, maybe they can get 5, 6, 7 basis points. And that, quite honestly, isn't compelling enough for the simplicity of just having it in their normal operating account. And although we have -- continually have conversations with our clients about the best place for it to be, we make recommendations, it comes back to that timing isn't -- that delta isn't really worth making a change right now. And so we'll continue to have those conversations. We'll continue to target the higher balances to kind of show them the opportunity that they're missing out on. But it is hard, which is why we're talking about the Tier 1 leverage ratio, which is why we're talking about if it doesn't change, we'll be looking at these alternatives from a capital perspective. But I could think of a lot worse problems to have than a great client franchise where you've got deposits coming in at the pace we have them.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Yes and I do. There are plenty banks that are [indiscernible] of your deposit base. The -- one last question for Mike. Can you identify if there was any outsized compensation cost that were tied to the high level of warrant investment gains in the quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I mean, there're certainly some. As far as the question of high and material, probably not overly significant for you to really recognize on the general trend of the compensation expenses. I mean, by and large, really what -- the growth really came from was certainly the solid incentive compensation -- sorry, solid performance, which just drives some incentive compensation overall for the entire bank. But also that you may recall some of the seasonal expenses that we do have as well in the first quarter, related to the beginning of the new year and the 401(k) matchings that a lot of companies have to do towards the beginning of the year, as well as the new taxes or the updated tax positions for individuals on payroll on as well. So there're a variety of seasonal items.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Matthew Keating at Barclays.", "Matthew J. Keating - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "I was hoping you could -- I appreciate the update on the, I guess, the fund or the investments that would be covered under the Volcker Rule. I was wondering if you could maybe size the magnitude. If these Volcker Rule restrictions were in effect today, what the magnitude of the impact on earnings per share might have been in the most recent quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "That's a very hypothetical one for me. There's a few components where we actually make money from our funds business. Clearly, we make money on -- well, we receive revenues on management fees as well. We have our own capital gains that we can make, as well as a carried interest position. Certainly, it would have a significant impact on particularly investment gains that we -- you were talking about. And in relation to FireEye, for example, you would exclude the warrants. But outside the warrants, we actually had some very solid gains from the investment security. So I think that's the way to look at it, is if Volcker was in place, it would essentially affect your investment gains, but not necessarily the carry position as well, which we obviously outlined in our press release as well.", "Matthew J. Keating - Barclays Capital, Research Division", "So would the Volcker Rule then impact sort of warrants? Or that's outside the scope of the Volcker Rule?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Our belief is that it's not in scope.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos with JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Actually, I had a few follow-ups. Sorry, my apologies. What was the average balance of the capital call loans in the first quarter? And how did that compare to last quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "I don't have that right at the tip of my fingertips, but it certainly grew as we talked about. I would probably characterize -- again, don't quote me necessarily. I'm going to go out on a limb here a little bit. But approximately half of our average loan growth in the quarter, Steve, was related to kind of the capital call lines of credit. So that probably puts us around close to $2 billion-ish, plus or minus, of it. But it was a very strong category for us in the first quarter.", "Gregory W. Becker", "On an average basis, Steve, I think period -- at period end, actually, there wasn't a dramatic change at period end. But it was -- we had kind of a run-up at the end of the year and then the average was held for quite a while, and then it dropped back down at period end.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, was there anything unusual driving the loan portfolio yield down so much this quarter?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So that would have been primarily a mix item. So again, when you look at capital call lines of credit, which tends to be based off prime in this environment, it's prime minus, so you're looking at 3.25% and less than -- on 3%, somewhere in that area. And if we're looking at loan yields, the previous quarter is around 5.70% area. Obviously, that's going to bring it down.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka with KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "In terms of the warrants that you have in FireEye, you stated before that your general practice is to sell your equity holdings as soon as practical. So are there -- I mean, I know some of the shares held by the funds, you don't have control over. But in terms of your warrants, are those free and clear and available-for-sale? And how should we expect about your actual realization of an exiting of the FireEye position?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So that's right. In general, we do try to exit when it's reasonably possible. What happens is when you exercise warrants, you actually have to wait for the delivery of the shares, which can take some time as well, too. And then also, before you sell them, you got to go through a process or governance process as well internally to make sure that you're free and clear and there's no inside information, for example, or things that prevent you from selling. So there is a process and a governance process that you do need to follow before you can actually sell. So it does take some time, a couple of weeks to actually get out of the position.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "And is it reasonable to think that by the end of the second quarter, you may very well have sold your shareholding? Or is this something that will take like a couple of quarters?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So with respect to the warrants, yes, you are correct. We -- it would be reasonable to assume we would sell the warrants during this quarter.", "Operator", "And there are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to your, CEO, Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great, thanks. So again, as you heard on the call, we are off to a great start so far in 2014. And as Mike highlighted, we have increased guidance in several fronts due to our belief that, both from our performance in the market, we're trending in a good direction, better direction even than we expected.", "So I just want to thank all our clients for being part of SVB's platform, our shareholders for trusting us and our employees for making it all happen. So thanks to everyone for joining us, and have a great rest of '14. See you.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

Ms. O'Leary, you may begin your conference.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Kyle, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our third quarter 2014 financial results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.

Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great. Thanks, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. SVB delivered a good quarter with net income of $63 million and earnings per share of $1.22, reflecting continued robust balance sheet growth, healthy loan and fee activity and solid credit quality. Positive funding exit and business conditions for our clients and our successful efforts at winning and keeping clients enabled us to deliver strong growth for the quarter, including average total client funds growth of 6% to $60.7 billion, average loan growth of 3% to $11.4 billion and core fee income growth of 7% to $53.3 million. We also posted solid credit quality with net charge-offs of just 28 basis points of total gross loans.", "We continue to perform well as a result of our focus on the innovation ecosystem, where positive business conditions for our clients and expanding market opportunity and our work to cement client relationships are helping to drive our strong performance.", "Exits of VC-backed companies remain strong. There were 21 U.S. venture-backed IPOs in the third quarter for a total of 86 so far in 2014. 64% of these were SVB clients. Year-to-date, the number of IPOs has already surpassed 2013, and at this pace, 2014 is on track to be the best year for IPOs since 2007.", "Merger and acquisition activity remains healthy. Year-to-date, the number of M&A transactions is up 15% year-over-year at 341, and the values of disclosed deals are up 86% at $8.8 billion.", "Strong capital investment continues. Venture capital, corporate venture and angel investment are all up year-over-year and at their current combined run rate, are on track to make 2014 the best year for early-stage investment since 2000. Thanks in part to this ready funding for good companies and expanding market and our unique place in innovation ecosystem, we've continued to win clients at a rapid pace, adding more than 1,300 new clients in the third quarter, primarily startups and early-stage companies.", "As we said in prior quarters, given the strength of these markets, we are paying close attention to today's valuations, which, admittedly, reflect very high expectations. While some companies and industries may be overheated based on what we're seeing, business models overall are better. New types of businesses are disrupting and creating entirely new industries, and many of the companies generating the most interest are performing strongly against revenue and growth expectations. As always, our primary goal with clients is to help increase their probability of success, which we do in a number of ways. One is through improving and expanding our product offerings in infrastructure. For instance, we recently began offering our clients 24-hour foreign-exchange trading, placing FX traders in our different time zones around the globe to provide seamless coverage. This move has helped improve our responsiveness to clients and has helped to drive a 13% increase in FX fees year-to-date.", "In the same vein, we've recently expanded coverage for wire processing in Asia in order to be able to process same-day transactions for our clients there.", "On the payments front, we launched a new transmission platform that offers clients a secure direct connection to our payment systems. And in the fourth quarter, we plan to launch our new global cards platform, offering credit cards to our U.K. and European Union clients. Our commitment to developing a robust payment platform has helped to boost card payment volumes by 35% and transaction volumes by 46% year-to-date.", "We're also very focused on supporting our clients' success by providing unique opportunities to enhance their business. For instance, working with MasterCard, we established Commerce.Innovated, an accelerator dedicated to helping payment startups get to market faster. We have already graduated one class of companies from this program, and our second class is underway.", "We are also a lead sponsor of the new Fintech Sandbox program designed to help early-stage financial technology companies put in place the infrastructure necessary to support and offer their services.", "And we're a lead investor in the Startup Institute, which runs education programs for individuals 2 to 10 years out of college, who want to transition from larger companies to startups. Think of it as a finishing school to give those individuals the soft skills they'll need to be successful in the startup. Startup Institute is one approach to providing qualified people to fill the large numbers of job openings our clients have available.", "Activities like these are showing how our differentiated value, which is supporting continued growth and a healthy pipeline. We are pleased with our ongoing strong performance and encouraged by the opportunities we see in our domestic and international target markets. Despite our good results, we face a number of ongoing challenges, including decreasing interest rates, which we didn't think was possible; increasing regulatory oversight and related costs; and an incredibly competitive market.", "Low interest rates have been a persistent challenge, of course. More recently, uncertainty in the markets caused long-term rates to decline even further, which impacts our new investment and reinvestment in our fixed income portfolio, and the timing of rate increases has been pushed out.", "Regulatory requirements also remain a challenge. We continue to build infrastructure and add people to support the increasingly intense -- intensive regulatory requirements related to BSA, stress testing, the Volcker Rule compliance and our global activities. All of these regulatory requirements add to our complexity and cost base.", "And competition remains intense. It's affecting our pricing and pace of loan growth. As we indicated last quarter, we're not willing to compromise the quality of loan growth for growth's sake. As a result, we're walking away from deals where we believe the risk and reward are out of balance. The good news, the robust market and our competitive differentiation are still allowing us to expand, win and retain the majority of relationships we pursue.", "Now I'd like to share our initial outlook for our 2015 growth versus 2014. Our outlook is based on the assumptions that our market will remain strong. Rates will remain a challenge. We will continue to invest in the business for long-term growth, and competition will remain intense. This outlook is based on our estimates to-date, and it is preliminary.", "We expect average loan growth in the low double digits. Now in the last few years we have had better-than-expected growth in some categories, among them private equity services in the private bank. We think we could see some upside potential in these areas in 2015 as well albeit at lower margins than other parts of the portfolio. The market is there, but as we've discussed, the pace of growth will depend on the terms and pricing and the balance of risk and reward.", "We expect average deposit growth in the high 20% range. Our clients' liquidity has grown well beyond our expectations, and our acquisition of new clients has been strong. Our 2015 outlook assumes continuous strong liquidity growth but with a higher portion of on or off balance sheet funds growth relative to deposit growth as a result of our continued efforts to offer better and more compelling investment solutions to our clients.", "We expect net interest income growth in the low double digits as a result of higher investment and loan balances offset somewhat by lower yields. This forecast is based, in part, on the market outlook for rates, but as you know, the market outlook changes day to day, so it could be volatile.", "We expect continued strength in credit quality with net loan charge-offs between 30 and 50 basis points of total gross loans, which is comparable to 2014. This assumes the economy remains stable. We expect core fee income growth in the mid-teens, driven primarily by foreign exchange, credit cards and client investment fees as a result of new products, solutions and a growing client base.", "And finally, we expect expense growth in the mid-single digits. Our outlook assumes we will continue to invest in our online delivery channels, infrastructure, new products and services and people, to support our growth. We also assume ongoing increases in compliance and regulatory costs.", "We're feeling positive about the year ahead. Despite the challenges we face, we'll continue to take advantage of the opportunities in our market, while maintaining our commitment to disciplined, reasonable growth. Our ongoing investment in our business and our long-term relationships with clients are helping us further solidify our unique position as the leading bank for the innovation economy. We believe the investments we've made in supporting growth today, combined with the considerable talents of our SVB team, will help us deliver growth over the long term. Thank you.", "And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg. It was a good quarter even considering the impact of FireEye, which we estimate reduced earnings per share by $0.11 per share. Our results were driven by continued strong execution of our strategy and a positive operating environment for our clients. Nevertheless, we continue to see pressure from low rates, and competition remains intense.", "I would like to highlight a few items, which I will cover in more detail shortly: first, solid loan growth at a modestly stronger pace than we saw in Q2; second, outstanding growth in total client funds, which includes on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds; third, higher net interest income and a lower net interest margin; fourth, continued strong credit quality; fifth, higher noninterest income due to investment securities and warrant gains, notwithstanding the impact of FireEye and solid fee income; and sixth, higher expenses primarily due to professional services supporting our growth. Additionally, I will comment on capital and updates to our 2014 outlook.", "Let me start with loan growth. Please note that these are quarter-over-quarter comparisons except where noted. Average loans grew by $359 million or 3.2% to $11.4 billion during the third quarter. This growth was driven primarily by capital call lending. Period-end loan balances grew by $668 million or 5.9% to $12 billion, driven primarily by capital call lines and sponsored buyout lending.", "We view this pace of loan growth as healthy. Nevertheless, competition and turnover of maturing loans in our sponsored buyout portfolio are impacting loan growth overall. As Greg mentioned, our commitment to disciplined, high-quality growth means we are being selective about new credits. Despite these dynamics, we are seeing a robust pace of activity and continue to win deals based on competitive terms and on the strength of our client relationships. We are maintaining our full year 2014 outlook for average loan growth in the high teens to low 20s, and we expect to deliver results near the top of that range.", "Moving to client funds. We continue to see outstanding growth in total client funds in the third quarter, although at a relatively more moderate pace than in the second quarter. Average total client funds, that is average deposits and average off-balance sheet client investment funds, increased by $3.4 billion or 5.9% to $60.7 billion during the third quarter. This compares to total client funds growth of $6.5 billion or 12.8% in the second quarter. Third quarter growth was driven by continued strong funding and exit markets for our clients and by our continued success at winning new clients.", "Average deposit balances grew by $2.6 billion or 9.4% to $29.7 billion, primarily driven by our early-stage clients. We are increasing our outlook for average deposit growth for the full year 2014 from the low 40s to the mid-40s and expect to be in the middle of that range. Average off-balance sheet client investment funds increased by $836 million or 2.8% to $31 billion, driven by the same strong funding and exit dynamics.", "Moving to net interest income and the net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $15.6 million or 7.6% to $220.6 million in the third quarter, driven primarily by a significant increase in average balances of our fixed income investment securities portfolio due to strong deposit growth and higher loan prepayment fees.", "Average balances of fixed income securities, which include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities increased by $3 billion or 20% to $18.2 billion. These higher balances drove an increase of $10.1 million in interest income to $74.7 million in the third quarter. The increase from volume was partially offset by lower yields on new investments.", "Period-end balances increased by $2.9 billion or 17% to $20 billion, reflecting $3.5 billion in new purchases. New investments during the quarter consisted of $2 billion of fixed-rate U.S. treasuries and $1.5 billion of agency-issued mortgage securities. The increase in the portfolio was offset by $555 million of maturities and mortgage paydown.", "Average yields on new purchases during the quarter were 1.34%, and durations was 3.2 years. Overall, yields on our fixed income portfolio decreased by 8 basis points to 1.63% due to current market rates. Duration at the end of the third quarter was 3 years compared to 3.1 years in the second quarter.", "Interest income from loans increased by $5.6 million to $153.3 million, driven primarily by higher fee income from early loan payoffs, 1 additional day in the quarter and loan growth. The positive effect of these factors were partially offset by a 10-basis-point drop in gross loan yields to 4.39%.", "Our ability to grow loans has historically driven higher overall net interest income, but we expect loan mix, competition and the low rate environment to continue to pressure loan yields moving forward. We are maintaining our outlook for net interest income in the low 20s for the full year 2014. We expect to deliver net interest income at the top of that range.", "Moving to the net interest margin. Our net interest margin declined by 6 basis points to 2.73% compared to 2.79% in Q2. The decline was largely driven by the deployment of continued strong deposit flows into our investment securities portfolio, although it was tempered by higher fees from low prepayments. Despite this decline, we are maintaining our current outlook for the full year 2014 and expect a net interest margin of between 2.75% and 2.85%, but we expect to end up near the bottom of that range.", "Now turning to credit quality. It remained strong during the third quarter. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $16.6 million compared to an exceptionally low $1.9 million in the second quarter. The higher provision was due to net charge-offs and loan growth. Net charge-offs were $8.3 million or 28 basis points of total gross loans. This compares to $4.8 million or 17 basis points in the second quarter. Third quarter net charge-offs included $10.7 million of gross charge-offs, primarily related to early-stage software loans and recoveries of $2.4 million.", "Our allowance for loan losses for performing loans increased by 3 basis points to 1.05% due to an increase in the level of criticized loans during the quarter. However, it is important to note that criticized loans, as a percentage of gross loans, were close to an all-time low in the second quarter and remained below our trailing 3-year and 5-year averages. The credit performance of our loan portfolio overall remains very strong.", "Impaired loans decreased by $10.6 million to $11.7 million in the third quarter, primarily due to repayments. At 10 basis points of total gross loans, our impaired loans remain near all-time low levels. We are maintaining our 2014 outlook for credit quality as previously reported.", "Now let us move to noninterest income. Noninterest income was $80.2 million for the third quarter compared to $14.2 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP noninterest income net of noncontrolling interest was $75.3 million in the third quarter compared to $49.5 million in the second quarter, and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further detail on those figures.", "The increase in non-GAAP noninterest income, net of noncontrolling interest, was primarily driven by lower private equity and venture capital-related investment losses of $1.1 million, net of noncontrolling interest. This compares to losses of $22.1 million, net of noncontrolling interest, in the second quarter. The decline in FireEye stock price during the third quarter was the primary contributor to these losses, accounting for $9.5 million of losses net of noncontrolling interest during the quarter. Notwithstanding FireEye's impact in the third quarter, the positive overall investment and exit trends that have benefited our investment securities in warrant portfolios in prior quarters continued.", "We saw gains of $8.4 million, net of noncontrolling interest, on the remaining portion of our PE and VC-related investment securities portfolio compared to $11.6 million in the second quarter. These gains were primarily due to strong distributions and increases in valuations. We also had gains of $13.2 million on equity warrants compared to $12.3 million in the second quarter. Warrant gains were due equally to increases in private company valuations and warrant exercises.", "Now I will move on to core fee income, which remained healthy. Core fee income increased $3.3 million or 7% to $53.3 million. Core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credits, deposit service charges, lending-related fees and client investment fees and is a non-GAAP measure. Again, please refer to the non-GAAP disclosures in our press release for more information. The increase in core fee income primarily reflects a $1.7 million increase in letter of credit revenue in the third quarter, primarily due to a nonrecurring item in Q2 and a $660,000 or 6.4% increase in credit card revenue to $10.9 million, driven by higher interchange fee income due to increased volume, partially offset by higher reward expense.", "Foreign exchange fees remained flat for the quarter, primarily due to mix and following a record second quarter. Foreign exchange has been a strong performer in 2014, growing by 31% year-over-year, and transaction volumes remain strong. We remain on track to meet our full year 2014 outlook for core fee income with growth in the high teens, and expect to deliver growth at the top of that range.", "Now turning to expenses. Noninterest expense increased by 5% or $8.5 million to $182 million. This increase was primarily due to higher professional services expense related to increased activities to support our expansion of product offerings as well as continued investment into ongoing business and IT infrastructure initiatives.", "As Greg mentioned, we continue to invest in the development of our systems, platforms and delivery channels as well as additional FTE to support our growth. Due to higher overall professional services expense associated with these efforts as well as ongoing regulatory and compliance costs, we are moving our 2014 expense outlook up a notch from the low double digits to the low teens, and we expect to end up in the lower part of that range.", "Moving onto capital. Our capital position remains strong overall, although deposit growth has increased our average asset base and continues to push our regulatory Tier 1 leverage ratio lower. Our bank Tier 1 leverage ratio ended the third quarter at 7.05%, down from 7.51% at the end of the second quarter. Our risk-based capital ratios Tier 1 and total capital ratios were lower by approximately 40 basis points compared to the second quarter, due primarily to an increase in period-end loans and unfunded loan commitments.", "Given our outlook on deposit growth, we continue to closely monitor the trend in our bank Tier 1 leverage ratio to ensure we are positioned to support our future growth. We expect our earnings to support a meaningful amount of deposit growth and continue to target at bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio between 7% and 8%. As Greg mentioned, we are continuing to focus on offering more off-balance sheet investment options to our clients. We will continue to evaluate the range of options available to us to support our growth and our Tier 1 leverage ratio, including downstreaming cash from the holding company to the bank as well as turning to the markets to raise capital, potentially debt securities.", "So let me wrap up. We delivered good results in the third quarter despite continued intense competition and the historically low rate environment. While the competitive environment and our commitment to high-quality growth have made it more challenging to replace some of the larger loans that are currently rolling off in the portfolio, our clients remain active, and our pipeline remains healthy. We have exceeded our forecast for the year so far, and Greg outlined for you that we will continue to see opportunity for growth in 2015.", "We will continue to focus on delivering solid performance by adding new clients and deepening our relationships with existing clients, growing interest-earning assets and building core fee income.", "Thank you. And now I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "I guess first question was, looking at the $3.5 billion of inflows of average client funds, can you give any color? And is that coming more from the record VC funding activity or the increased number of IPOs? And what kind of impact, if any, do you see the recent market volatility having on that?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So I guess, the first question, Joe, is about where did it come from and then kind of what's the outlook. So when you look at where it came from, it is -- predominantly, we look at the client base that's driving that. It is more early -- early stage is the biggest driver of that, and obviously, that's driven by venture capital funding. It's driven by corporate venturing, even angel investing in that category, which was, for the third quarter, was incredibly strong. And then you see additional dollars flowing in from later-stage companies as the T. Rowe Prices and Fidelities get more active in putting more money at the later stage. So it's not one area. It is truly across the board. And we also saw growth in our Asia clients as well, putting in more deposits again as they raise capital. IPOs have some impact, but it is mainly the private companies that are really driving that total client funds growth. Now the outlook is, as we said and I referred to the 2015 view for deposits, we still expect to see very strong growth in the -- in overall liquidity for our clients. We believe it's going to taper a little bit from where the growth was this year, which makes sense, and part of it is this year was so strong. The growth rate just can't, from my standpoint, keep at this level. But we're still looking for strong liquidity in 2015.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division", "And you said in '15, you're expecting more growth in the off-balance sheet accounts. How exactly do you see that playing out? Is it new products? Is it change in pricing? More concerted sales effort with incentives or what have you?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So the short answer is yes to all of the above. When you think about it with our clients, you got to start with what's the right thing for the clients. That's the most important thing. And you can look at our balance sheet right now and how much of those deposits are sitting in non-interest-bearing accounts. And while the yields that they're getting off balance sheet aren't substantial by any means, it is -- it's the right place for a lot of these funds to go. And right now there really hasn't been an incentive for them because if you can only get 4, 5 basis points off balance sheet, is it really worth the hassle? So what we're trying to do is make it as easy as possible for them to move the money to these off-balance sheet solutions, right? And so it's tempering that a little bit, moving it more towards the off balance sheet. Is it going to be a dramatic change? We don't think so. But it really doesn't need to be a dramatic change to make sure that we're coming in within the Tier 1 capital levels that we want to be at.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe I'll start -- just a follow-up on that. It looks like you had less success in the third quarter than the second quarter in directing clients into the off-balance sheet product. Is that because you just have more capital so you didn't push as hard? Or has demand for that product just trailed off here?", "Gregory W. Becker", "I -- Steve, this is Greg. I wouldn't read anything, quite honestly, into the third quarter because you can see in any quarter some pretty big swings, so I don't think it's a less emphasis on it. I don't think the -- it was less compelling to move off balance sheet. I would look at the trend and kind of the guidance that we're giving. So I think, as I said to Joe, it's the product set that we have. It's making sure we're making it as easy for our clients to move it off balance sheet and also really targeting some of the really large depositors that have hundreds of millions of dollars sitting in an account, where it truly is the best for them to move it off balance sheet. So we obviously expect to make progress on that over the coming quarters.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Okay. What was the balance of the sponsor-led buyout loans at the end of the quarter? And can you talk about what paydowns were? And are paydowns in that bucket basically the key driver of your 2015 outlook, which is a bit more modest than it was at this stage last year?", "Marc C. Cadieux", "This is Marc Cadieux. The sponsor-led buyout portfolio was actually up a bit in the third quarter. It's about 16% of our loan portfolio, recognizing that to be a pretty good outcome in as much as we did see some significant loan payoffs at the same time. So encouraged that has been a slower part of the growth in the first half of the year as leverage had kind of moved away from us and caused us to compete less frequently. But we saw some more strength there in the third quarter.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Steven, let me give a perspective on next year. So we still expect to see payoffs to occur in the buyout portfolio in 2015. And although we expect to see growth in that area, the market's a strong market, and so you're starting to see exits happen with the private equity firms as they try to sell these assets. So we're replacing and growing that portfolio. The rest of the growth is really going to come from, I'd say, mainly a couple of different areas, but then it's broad based below that. The main areas are private equity services, the private bank. Again, we'll see some of the buyout, and to a lesser extent, we're going to see global and the general technology market. So across the board, but predominantly private equity services, the private bank is what we expect to see that. And again, the tempered growth, first of all, still feel good about the growth in the low double digits, but it is -- from a competitive standpoint, we expect the market to be very competitive. We're going to be very selective on where we want to play. And as I said in my comments, there's upside there, and if we do see upside, I would expect that to be in the private equity services and the private bank.", "Steven A. Alexopoulos - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division", "Maybe just one final one. The loan-to-deposit ratio pushed down below 40% again. Now looking at the preliminary guidance, it's going to push down even further next year. Are you guys considering any other lending areas within your niche or even options such as loan purchases or anything like that?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. Steve, this is Greg. We've -- when I go back and look over the last 10 or 15 years, I would say, where we have strayed from our focus, we probably have stumbled more than we've done a good job. And I think that really tight focus on our market, the markets that we serve, is really the right place for us to stick to. When I think of expansion, I think of global. Global was a little bit flat this quarter but mainly because of paydowns. And as I've said in prior earnings calls, I look at global, and that's an area that should be growing 30%, 40%, 50% on an annual basis. I'd rather again stick to our target market and in global and in sponsor-led buyout, private banking, in those areas because if we can still grow in the low double digits and maybe have some upside there, that feels right. Your loan-to-deposit ratio question really is a function of not of loan growth, which is strong. It's actually more of a function of we have such a strong deposit franchise, but that tends to swamp the growth we have in loans. I'll take that any day because it really is a sign that we're really targeting a very robust market.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Julianna Balicka from KBW.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "I just wanted to follow up on a couple of different areas. One, in terms of the competition that you highlighted as being more intense in your remarks, the -- what about the competition changed linked quarter and/or about the outlook of competition changed that you have highlighted it so differently in this call? I mean, is it new entrants? Or are -- is it preexisting entrants becoming more competitive on pricing? Is it underwriting terms? I mean, what happened -- what was the catalyst behind the change in tone?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes. So Julianna, this is Greg. I'll start and Marc may want to add to it. When I think of the competitive landscape and we compete on a debt basis, you're looking at price, size and structure being the 3 components. As I've said in prior calls, you can look at all 3 of those components, and we're seeing a very aggressiveness in all 3 of those areas. And pricing is one thing, and we've seen that maybe start to really be impacted a couple of years ago. Pricing is getting even more competitive. And the areas that we're being more sensitive about is really on the structure, and when structure starts to give, that's when we're starting to back away. So it's really the aggressiveness and structure that we're seeing that we're really making sure we're sharpening our pencil and being with the right companies. Has anything changed dramatically? No, but the longer you see that intense competition at a certain level, that's just -- it becomes more challenging to figure out where you want to play and where you don't want to play. That being said, as I mentioned in my comments, we're still winning the majority of companies we want to pursue either by winning new business or retaining existing clients, and that's really because we offer a very differentiated both product solution and value add to our clients compared to our competitors. So I wouldn't say it's new competition. I wouldn't say it's something that's changed dramatically. It's just the continuation of that intensity.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. That makes sense. And then another area in your remarks that struck my attention was how you had highlighted the regulatory and compliance costs, which, of course, many banks are encountering. However, in your outlook for 2015, your increase in expenses doesn't seem out of line with your previous outlooks in -- beginning of the year outlooks in previous times. So is it that you are investing less in certain growth areas and replacing that with compliance costs? Or I mean, how should we think about kind of what's going on in the mix of the expense growth?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Sure, Julianna. This is my Mike here. So you are right, so we are forecasting a decline -- sorry, in the growth rate of expenses for 2015. But just backing up a step, I mean, as you know, one of the main reasons why 2014 expenses have increased from the initial guidance is because of outperformance, right, the incentive compensation that goes along with the outperformance. So as a result, the primary reason why we've gone from that initial forecast of mid-single digits to our new outlook for the rest of the year for 2014 is almost entirely related to incentive compensation. Having said that, we have continued to invest in systems delivery channels, and as well as there's been some compliance and regulatory costs as well, too. But again, we have the outlook there for 2015 because, again, you go into the year, and you start anew with new targets. And again, if we overperform those initial targets, you'll see it go up, but again, it's that pay for performance.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "So it sounds like the regulatory aspect of it is kind of as a outgrowth of your strategic investment initiatives as opposed to an input, like for banks are, say, crossing $50 billion. You know what I mean?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "That's right. I mean, we've been investing and dealing with regulatory challenges like a lot of banks have for quite some time, so it's nothing new for us. It's just a continued added expense.", "Julianna Balicka - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then finally, I find your comments about financial technology interesting, and I had a side question about that kind of seeking of competition. Do you think about nonbank lenders as direct threat such as lending club? Or I mean, how do they even interact in your space? And what's your view of nonbank lenders as you go on to support financial technology?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Julianna. This is Greg again. And actually, we view them as being great opportunities for us to partner with them. Most of the non-bank lenders that are out there are going after consumer finance in some form or fashion, which, as you know, we don't do or just through our private bank. So we look at partnering with them and really figuring out how to leverage them -- having them leverage us in our infrastructure for payments and solutions. So we view it more as an opportunity as opposed to a challenge or a competitive threat. And we have a whole payments team. We're dedicated to not just these type of companies but really, payment companies or FinTech companies in general, again, so we view it as an opportunity.", "Marc C. Cadieux", "This is Marc. The only thing I would add to that is I think Greg's remarks are about FinTech and payment companies, and I'll call it that category of non-bank lender. We do have competition from another category of non-bank lender, both at the early stage and for sponsor-led buyout.", "Gregory W. Becker", "These are venture debt funds, BDCs, those sort of things, so we're kind of bifurcating those 2 things.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill & Partners.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "I just want to, I guess, rehash a couple of points here that have been topics. One is on the expense line. Can you give any color beside -- behind the suddenness of this increase that you've had in the professional services? Was there something in particular this past quarter that drove that higher?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "No, nothing in particular, Aaron. And again, you start initiatives. There are some timing challenges as well, too, right, so you begin the year thinking you're going to start some projects at the beginning of year, where you'd have more smoothing or so of expenses but again, just some of the projects that did start in Q3.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "And so this is truly a run rate going forward off of this base level?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Well, I think the -- probably the best thing for you to do is refer to our 2015 outlook, right, so kind of going back to that mid-single digits, and obviously, we gave you the rest of the outlook for 2014. So I think you can kind of back into what would be kind of a normal average. Again, as you know, we look at more the full year as versus by quarter number.", "Aaron James Deer - Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P., Research Division", "Fair enough. And then in dealing with the deposit challenges, I mean, you guys have had these extraordinary deposit inflows for quite some time, so it's not a new phenomenon. I got to think you guys have been trying to work and then develop these alternative products to get some of this off balance sheet for a while. So where does that stand in process? When might you expect to see something coming online that has a real incentive to bring some of this off the balance sheet?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, Aaron. This is Greg. Let me take a step back first, and when I look at the growth in total client funds, we expected growth. We didn't expect growth anywhere to the degree that we have seen, so I think it would be hard for anyone to have predicted that. And it's a function of 2 things, right, the market, number one, and our success of winning new clients. It's those 2 areas combined that have driven this growth. And when we think about the answer to your question, which is how successful have we been, I would argue we've been very successful when you look at the amount of liquidity that has moved off balance sheet. The challenge has been the entire growth has been massive, so we've done a really good job, but the growth has been even faster than that. So when we talk about what else are we doing, those are the products and services and making it simple for our clients to move that money off balance sheet. So we're working more on that simplification to make it easy and compelling for our clients to move off balance sheet and just a renewed focus. I would tell you that I expected 2 things to happen. One is the deposit growth to temper a little bit more from a volume perspective just based on lower funding, really hasn't happened, number one. And number two, my hope as well was that interest rates were going to be heading up, growing in the second quarter of next year. And as that happens, it's easier to direct that money off balance sheet as there's better opportunities for them. And as I said in my comments, we didn't think rates could go lower, I guess. We didn't think rates could continue to be extended, and that changed a couple of weeks ago. And so those 2 things are really causing us to have a renewed focus on making sure that simplicity of moving deposits off balance sheet is the right thing for us and the right thing for our clients.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jared David Wesley Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "I guess could you just let us know what the total prepayment penalty was for the quarter and what your expectations are on that sort of specifically going forward?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So roughly the prepayment fees that we're referring to were roughly around $4.5 million, is what we had talked about. Again, it varies quarter-to-quarter. I mean, I think that was a pretty good quarter on that one. I wouldn't necessarily say that, that's the run rate. But again, you can look to the last couple of quarters in our disclosures and our press release if you want to kind of map it out and graph it out.", "Jared David Wesley Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division", "Okay. And then, Greg, you had mentioned a little bit about some frothiness in the valuation on -- in the IPO markets. What -- any particular industry that's giving you concern? And is that more you think that we're at a plateau there or that things just start pulling back from those valuations?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Yes, Jared. Your maintenance thing [ph] I'd say higher valuations in software service, cloud computing, security companies, marketplaces, social. I'd say those are general categories that we either -- probably all wouldn't surprise us. Then, you really see a big distinction where the companies that start to hit performance levels. Once they start to see good trends, that's when you start to see valuations pick up dramatically, and also, the dollars that people are willing to invest in these companies pick up dramatically. Again, the size of these rounds are massive. It's a largest sort of financings I've seen for private companies, where you're seeing consistently $50 million, $75 million, in some cases, even $100 million rounds being closed. And that's -- those are the areas where you're really seeing what I'll call price for perfection occurring with these high-performing companies.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Brett Rabatin from Sterne Agee.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Wanted to just talk about the -- with this deposits, obviously, continuing to be faster growth and that's the expectation as well in '15. Can you talk maybe a little bit about obvious disappointment with what's happened with rates? But any thought on a barbell strategy in the securities portfolio going forward? i.e., can the net yield improve in the taxable AFS portfolio? Or do you continue to be super conservative with what you're doing there very short term, and so maybe it continues to be under pressure? Any thoughts around that?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "Yes. No doubt there are pressures on investment securities portfolio for sure. I would say we have to be sensible because when you start to look at the size of an investment portfolio in terms of proportion to your balance sheet, you've got to be really sensible, right? So we're now up to $20 billion of our -- we have $20 billion of investment securities versus a $36 billion balance sheet. So as you know, you got to be very cautious because if interest rates move, the rates gap up. That obviously can cause some challenges. So for us, the primary area that we are going for is liquidity. And obviously, in the low rate environment, pretty much across the curve, rates are just low, and you just don't get paid to going out for any longer duration. So I would say you would probably continue to see us buy U.S. treasuries, continue to see us kind of in that 3-year duration. Yes, we might be able to go up a little bit as well, but again, you just got to be conscious of that and again, just not go and chase yield.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then, I guess, the other thing I was hoping to maybe get a little more color on was the prior commentary around competition and that having an impact on loan yields. I mean, they're still very robust. I guess I'm just curious if you guys have any thoughts on the magnitude of declines in the portfolio yield. Saw it, obviously, from the noise with loan fees, but does that pick up going forward? Or do you kind of feel like that is a manageable grind despite the environment?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So this is Mike again, and I'll start, and some of my colleagues can jump in. But yes, I think the bottom line answer is you will continue to see pressure on loan yields, and it's for a variety of reasons, right? Part of it is actually the loan mix, so as we go into adding more private equity, capital call lines of credit, those tend to be in a lower rate albeit very high credit quality. So if you go back and look at kind of that declining glide path or declining loan yields over the last 2 years or so, you're probably going to see continued declines of that nature in the loan yields. It's just the nature of the mix, coupled with the fact that what we've talked about was the competitive environment is really, really fierce, right? And so when a loan actually goes up for renewal or rolls up on an annual basis, again, given the competition and tighter spreads and just overall lower rate -- lower rates in the market, you're going to see those kind of compressed. So yes, it definitely continues to be under pressure, but again, it is just reflective of the market.", "Brett D. Rabatin - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division", "But it sounds like, Mike, you're basically saying that with the environment getting somewhat more competitive, you don't necessarily expect that pressure would increase on yields on a relative basis to past quarters necessarily.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Brett, this is Greg. I'd probably say that, again, as you have a portfolio of loans and as those loans come up for renewal, it's, in some cases, a very competitive process. And so you would see some yield deterioration just based on the churn in the portfolio as new deals are added. That, combined with, Mike said, the mix, then you should continue to see some pressure downward on loan yields. What is important to note though and you'd mentioned this at the beginning of your comments about where our loan yields are, which are still actually good relative to, I'd say, the market, and it's mainly because we've spent so much time talking about the value add that we bring to the table, and companies want to work with us because, again, and it may sound somewhat trite that we can help our clients be more successful. We really believe that. We hear it from our clients. And so that does give us a pricing premium in the market. And we don't take that lightly. We have to deliver on that. But it still is a very competitive market, and that trend downward in loan yields is what we'd expect to see.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America.", "Ebrahim H. Poonawala - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division", "All my questions have been asked.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Long from Raymond James.", "David J. Long - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division", "History has shown that you guys have been able to keep funding costs low even in a rising rate environment. I wanted to get your view here, and it's maybe a different -- times are different this time around. Looking out over the next couple of years, if we do get that rate increase in the short term, how do you see that playing out with your deposits? And will you be able to keep your funding costs low like you have in the past?", "Michael R. Descheneaux", "So very good observation, right. Our deposit franchise has been very strong, have been known for very low-cost deposit base, primarily because we keep a significant amount of our clients' operating cash on the balance sheet. And for those clients who do want yield, we tend to get them in the off balance sheet. Going forward, it's anybody's guess. But I guess when I step back and look about it, if rates go up, then clearly, there could be a need that we might have to pay more for deposits to keep them on the balance sheet, which is okay. It's not necessarily a bad thing because what that means is if rates are likely up because then on the asset side and the loan side, you'll actually be making more interest income as well, too, which allow you to pay up for the deposits if you actually need them, right? So we've been very, very fortunate, very, very liquid and had significant amount of deposits to fund our loan growth. So I think we're in a really good position, but time will tell whether or not we will actually have to pay up. But again, if you look at history, history shows that we have a large amount of demand deposits, and we don't really have to pay up for them.", "Gregory W. Becker", "So Dave, this is Greg. Let me just add on to that. The one thing, I think, it's important to keep in mind is looking at the total client funds number and the amount of money that companies would typically keep in an operating account even if rates start to pick up. So let's just do the simple math. You got $60 billion of total client funds. If you were to keep 20%, 25% at -- in operating cash, right, you can look at just in a DDA account or checking account, you can look at $12 billion to $15 billion sitting in that operating account even as rates pick up. And so when you think about that being the main part of your funding costs, keeping that at a very low level, 0, obviously, that is a big impact on what your total cost of funds actually is. So I think going back and looking at that on a historical basis in a higher rate environment, I don't see the mix of the operating cash to total cash being that different.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Pancari from Evercore.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "On the competitive topic again, can you give us a little more detail? What loan types are you seeing the greatest amount of competitive pressure right now? And if you can, can you give us an idea of where your new production yields are coming in at?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So John, this Greg, and then I'll let Marc add even more color to my comments. So we're seeing competition across the board. And you can look at the early stage. You can look at mid-stage and the buyout financing. You're seeing refinances come. So you're seeing it from a variety of different areas. You're also seeing -- it's interesting. You're seeing competition also from the amount of liquidity in the market, right? When you see these companies that are raising massive rounds of equity financing, you sit back and you say even though you may have availability of a term loan or even acquisition financing in some cases, you sit back and you say why would I even spend, rates are low, money to borrow if you have this excess liquidity that isn't earning a whole lot. So our utilization rates have dropped down a little bit, but we are seeing, again, competition pretty consistent across the board. I'll have Marc add some color both on the -- where we're seeing it more but also on where the yields are.", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Yes. Well, as Greg mentioned, the competition is broad based. It's pretty much in every segment of our business. To give you a sense for where yields are in the current environment and maybe focusing on those areas where our growth has been the greatest, capital call lending, the range there tends to be in the high 2s to low 3%. The same for our private bank. It's been in the low 3% of late. Going to some of the higher margin, which maybe we wish were growing a little more, sponsor-led buyout would still be in the low 5% range. Again, we're talking interest-only yields and net of fees. And then finally, our early-stage lending tends to similarly be in that low to mid-5% range.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And the later stage is just similar to traditional C&I, I guess, that the other banks are seeing?", "Marc C. Cadieux", "Yes. Later stage would be in that high 3% to -- maybe mid-3% to low 4% range.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. And then separately, can you give us a little -- just an update on the size of the global loan book and then also the growth rate that you're seeing there?", "Gregory W. Becker", "Sure, John. This is Greg. And if you look at the total loan portfolio, the global loan portfolio, which is -- includes London global private equity services, so private equity firms, capital call loans that are international, what we're seeing in those kind of 2 areas mainly, you're looking at about $800 million of total loans. This past quarter, we saw some pretty significant paydowns with a couple credits on the more substantive side. That being said, the pipeline and outlook is very strong, and so that's an area, again, as I mentioned in my earlier comments, that you could see substantial year-over-year growth just because we're still coming into the market, especially U.K., and we're delivering our full product set from a lending perspective from early-stage loans to buyouts to private equity services. And it's a small base to grow from, so the percentages actually tend to be higher. So that we feel very good is an opportunity for growth for the next several years.", "John G. Pancari - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division", "Okay. All right. And then lastly on your comments about spending on risk and compliance as you're over the -- through this year and then your expectations for next year, are you pretty much implying that the spending you're doing now you feel -- or you're starting to factor in the infrastructure you're going to need as you approach and surpass $50 billion?", "Gregory W. Becker", "So John, this is Greg. And we've been -- it's not as if you hit a switch and all -- one thing and all of a sudden everything changes. It's something you build into. And the regulators are looking at this, and although they don't say you have to comply with the $50 billion today, they are asking for greater, I guess, just increasing the bar on a regular basis. So yes, it's being built in. Is part of it heading towards the $50 billion? Yes, sure part of it's heading towards the $50 billion, but it's kind of a steady increase that we see on a quarterly basis.", "Operator", "There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Greg Becker for closing comments.", "Gregory W. Becker", "Great. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We delivered another real good quarter of growth in deposits and core fee income, so feel very good about that. And it's really because we're in the right market, and we believe we have the right strategy not just for 2014 or 2015, but we have the right strategy for many years to come. And we're so fortunate to have such great clients that support us and great employees that help us support those clients. So feel really good about where we are, really good about where we're going and hope everyone has a great day. Thanks.", "Operator", "This concludes today's conference call.

My name is Bathsheba [ph], and I will be your operator for today's call.", "[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Meghan, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Bathsheba [ph], and thank you everyone for joining us today.", "Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here today to talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. They'll be joined by other members of the management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and the actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information. The disclaimer applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion today may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We commit [ph] the call, including Q&A, to an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker. ", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thanks everyone for joining us today.", "The fourth quarter of 2014 was a strong end to a very good year for SVB. We delivered earnings per share of $1.14 and net income of $58.8 million for the quarter. That includes the sale of our non-bank financial company in India which impacted EPS by approximately $0.23.", "For the full year 2014, we delivered earnings per share of $5.31 and net income of $264 million, versus EPS of $4.70 and net income of $216 million last year.", "We were very pleased with our financial results for 2014. We saw innovation and robust activity across all types and stages of clients, and we experienced broad-based growth across our business.", "We grew average loans by 23% or $2.1 billion, to $11.5 billion. As a reminder, this is the full year average. We grew average total client funds, that is deposits plus off-balance-sheet client investments, by 32% or $14.5 billion, to $58.4 billion, also a full year average. We grew net interest income by 23% to $857 million.", "We maintained excellent credit quality with net charge-offs of just 32 basis points for the year. We grew core fee income by 20% to $210 million, and we delivered a healthy return on equity of 10.46%.", "We delivered these outstanding results, thanks to our continued focus on our strategy, which is to build deep relationships with fast-growth innovation companies and their investors, and leverage our platforms and expertise to grow our market leadership. This focus enabled us to significantly expand our client relationships on our business in 2014. For example, we grew our net client count by 21%. This growth came from strengthening our dominant position with earl-stage companies that drive expansion in the innovation industry. At the same time, we had a number of larger late-stage companies we work with.", "We maintained our market share of the best companies. Sixty-four percent of the U.S. venture-backed innovation companies that went public in 2014 and 2013 were SVB clients.", "We significantly expanded our activities with private equity firms. We added more than 100 new private equity clients in 2014 who contributed significantly to our growth, increasing loans to private equity clients by more than 50% and fee income by approximately 45%. We increased core fee income by 20%. This increase was driven primarily by higher foreign exchange and credit card fee income. Foreign exchange volumes and revenues increased by 42% and 25%, respectively. Credit card transaction volumes increased by 46%. And we are working with disruptive Fin Tech [ph] clients to be the backbone of their payment systems by leveraging our own systems here at SVB along with those of our partners.", "We successfully leveraged our private bank and wealth advisory to expand our client relationships. We gained more than 350 new clients in the private bank in 2014, and grew average loans by 26% to just over $1 billion.", "And finally, we increased our global client count by 60% year over year, adding more than 1,000 new clients, compared to 645 in 2013. Our global balance sheet grew strongly with 61% growth in average loans and a 100% increase in average deposits year over year.", "And in another significant milestone, we applied for our local currency license in China this month and hope to receive approval later this year.", "As our 2014 results demonstrate, we are executing effectively and delivering growth. In addition, our clients in our markets are performing well overall. While concerns over global economic growth continue to upset the markets, the U.S. economy at least is showing gradual improvement and unemployment continues to decline as consumer confidence increases.", "The NASDAQ rose by 15% in 2014 and the Dow closed the year near all-time highs. And although the markets are off to a somewhat rocky start in 2015, the long-term trend remains positive.", "The venture capital industry just enjoyed one of its strongest years in a decade, investing $48 million and raising an additional $30 billion for new investments. These sums are in addition to the capital infusions from corporates and angels and other sources of funding that we've been talking about for the past year. As a result, new company formation is stronger than ever.", "Exit activity was also strong. In 2014 there were 109 IPOs of U.S. venture-backed innovation companies. Another 455 companies exited by merger or acquisition. And the aggregate value of these deals was the highest in history.", "Valuations for the most promising companies and for companies overall continue to decline. While some of these companies are priced for perfection, they are priced that way because of their strong performance and the potential value of the markets they're disrupting. Business models overall are better. Many of these companies are staying private longer, strengthening the business models and growing much bigger before turning to the public markets as mature companies. Their valuations reflect that.", "In addition, the demand among public market investors, corporate investors and institutional limited partners for investment and innovation economy is growing. That too is contributing to higher valuations.", "Against this backdrop of strong performance and improving economy and a positive environment for our clients, we're starting 2015 on strong footing. As you can see from the full year outlook in our press release, we have increased our outlook for loans, deposits and net interest income.", "While we're optimistic about 2015, we are facing several persistent challenges that we've discussed before. The current rate environment is extremely challenging, and although the Fed is expected to begin raising interest rates towards the end of 2015, we believe we're unlikely to see much benefit from such an increase this year.", "Competition remains intense and shows no sign of letting up. As such, we will continue to focus on our differentiation and value-add, while remaining committed to maintaining our underwriting standards.", "And the regulatory burden continues to grow, particularly as we approach $50 billion in assets. But as we have said before, we've been preparing for this eventuality, though we expect to have some time before reaching that threshold. In the meantime, we continue to invest in people, systems and processes to ensure that we can support our continued growth.", "Despite these challenges, we feel good about our strategy, our target market, and our people, and we remain focused on being the best partner as possible to our clients. The expertise we build over 30 years of banking high-growth innovation companies enables us to guide our clients through every stage of their development, from scaling up from a bare-bones startup, to running complex global enterprises. Although we are larger than we've ever been, and we operate globally, we remain agile, client-focused and able to move quickly to meet our clients' needs.", "As we enter 2015, we are focused in delivering high-quality growth and expanding our client base, our capabilities and our global reach. We see ample opportunities ahead both near term and long term, provided that U.S. and global economies will remain relatively on track. We believe our amazing employees and commitment to being the best at what we do are keys to our success and will continue to differentiate us.", "Thank you. And now I will turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon everyone.", "We had a strong quarter across the board, marked by significant growth in loans and deposits, as well as substantial private equity and venture capital related investment and warrant gains.", "I would like to highlight a few items in my comments today, which I will cover in more detail shortly. First, significant loan growth. Second, growth in total client funds, which includes on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds. Third, higher net interest income despite a lower net interest margin. Fourth, continued strong credit quality, with a higher provision for loan losses related to loan growth. Fifth, higher non-interest income due to investment securities and warrant gains, offset partially by the sale of our Indian NBFC. And sixth, our capital ratios and the related impact of growth in the quarter. In relation to this, I will comment later on the shelf-registration for senior debt securities that we filed today. Additionally, I will provide an update on our outlook for 2015.", "Let us start with loans which grew substantially in the fourth quarter. Period-end loans grew by 20% or $2.4 billion, to $14.4 billion. A significant portion of this growth was driven by higher utilization of existing capital call facilities by our private equity clients, but we also saw strength across the board. In fact, the utilization rate in the private equity portfolio increased by 10 percentage points to 38%.", "Average loans grew by 11% or $1.3 billion, to $12.7 billion, due to healthy activity across the loan portfolio, particularly in private equity. Given that we have substantial loan growth in the fourth quarter, I would like to provide some clarity on how we view this growth.", "In the last three years we have seen notably stronger period-end loan growth during the final quarter of the year, particularly the last month of the year. These period-end balances typically decline somewhat in the first quarter. As of January 20th, period-end balances have declined by approximately $600 million from yearend levels. With this in mind, we believe period-end loan growth could temper or even be flat in Q1. We would also expect a return to a more typical pace of growth in 2015.", "Notwithstanding that pattern, we are raising our 2015 outlook for average loan growth to the mid-20s and believe there are still potential upside from private equity software and the private bank. Moreover, we would expect to meet our 2015 average loan growth targets even if period-end balances were to temper.", "Now let us move to total client funds. Again this includes both on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds. In the fourth quarter, average total client funds grew by 6% or $3.7 billion, to $64.5 billion, due to continued healthy funding and exit markets for our clients, and strong client acquisition.", "Positive growth was particularly strong among our early-stage growth and private equity clients, who helped drive average deposit growth of 10% or $2.9 billion to $32.6 billion. Period-end deposit balances increased by 10% or $3.2 billion, to $34.3 billion, primarily driven by our early-stage and growth clients.", "Moving to net interest income and the net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $14.2 million or 6.4%, to $235.2 million in the fourth quarter. The increase was driven by significant loan growth and higher average balances of fixed income securities due to strong deposit growth.", "Interest income from loans increased $8.5 million, driven by growth but offset by yield compression of 27 basis points, primarily due to increasing private equity capital call lines of credit which tend to have lower yields.", "Our ability to grow loans has historically driven higher overall net interest income, but we expect loan mix, particularly significant growth in capital call lines, as well as competition and the low-rate environment, to continue to pressure loan yields moving forward.", "Investment interest income increased by $6.5 million. The increase was driven by higher average balances of fixed income securities, that is available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities, which increased by $2.4 billion or 13% to $20.6 billion. The yield on a total fixed income portfolio decreased by 7 basis points to 1.56%. Normal runoff of higher-yielding mortgage securities and a slight increase in premium amortization expense contributed to the modest decline in yield.", "New purchases during the quarter averaged 1.63%. Portfolio duration remained stable and ended the year at 2.8 years, compared to 3 years at the end of the third quarter.", "Moving to the net interest margin. Our net interest margin declined by 7 basis points in the fourth quarter to 2.66%, compared to 2.73% in the third quarter. The decline was driven by increases in our investment securities portfolio due to deposit growth and to lower yield on loans due to loan mix given the significant growth in capital call lines of credit.", "Now, turning to credit quality. It remained strong overall during the fourth quarter. We recorded provision for loan losses of $40.4 million, versus $16.6 million in the third quarter. The majority of our provision was due to loan growth, which accounted for approximately $24 million of the total provision. Net charge-offs added $4 million. And the rest was due to an increase in specific reserves related to a single loan.", "Net charge-offs were exceptionally low at $4.1 million or 13 basis points of total gross loans, reflecting low growth charge-offs of $5 million, primarily related to early-stage loans.", "Our allowance for loan losses for performing loans remained relatively consistent at 1.04%, versus 1.05% in the third quarter. Non-performing loans increased to $38.1 million, compared to $11.7 million in the third quarter, primarily due to one loan in our software niche. At 27 basis points of total gross loans, our non-performing loans remain very low and the credit performance of our overall portfolio remained strong.", "Now let us move on to non-interest income. On -- excuse me. On a GAAP basis, non-interest income was $167.6 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $80.2 million for the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income, which is net of non-controlling interests, was $90.3 million, compared to $75.3 million in the third quarter. We encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. The major components of non-GAAP non-interest income were $36.8 million of gains from investment securities and warrants and $55.3 million of core fee income, offset by a $13.9 million loss related to the sale of our non-bank financial company in India. I encourage you to refer to our 8-K filed on January 16th, for more information on the India sale.", "Now I will go into the details of our non-interest income. We have private equity and venture capital related investment gains of $16.6 million net of non-controlling interest. These gains were due to strong distributions and increases in valuations stemming from positive investment and exit trends for our clients. Our fourth quarter gain compares to losses of $1.1 million in the third quarter. Those losses were primarily related to our FireEye holdings, and you will see in our press release that we have reduced our position significantly since the end of the third quarter.", "We had equity warrant gains of $20.2 million, compared to gains of $13.2 million in the third quarter, primarily due to valuation increases.", "Turning to core fee income. Core fee income remained healthy, increasing 3.6% or $2 million to $55.3 million. Core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credit, deposit service charges, lending related fees, and client investment fees, and is a non-GAAP measure. Again please refer to the non-GAAP disclosures in our press release for more information.", "The increase in the fourth quarter was due primarily to an increase in lending related fees due to higher unused commitment fees, an increase in foreign exchange fees related to higher transaction and trade volumes, and an increase in credit card interchange fee income, partially offset by higher credit card rewards expenses.", "Moving on to capital. Our capital position remained strong overall, although deposit growth has increased our average asset base and continues to pressure our tier 1 leverage ratio. Despite the offsetting impact of our strong earnings growth in the fourth quarter, our bank level tier 1 leverage ratio decreased by 40 basis points to 6.65%.", "Our risk-based capital ratios, total risk-based capital and tier 1 risk-based capital, decreased by approximately 100 basis points at both the holding company and the bank level, due to our significant period-end loan growth. We continue to closely monitor the trend in our capital ratios, the bank level tier 1 leverage ratio in particular for which our general target range is between 7% and 8%. We filed a shelf registration statement this morning that provides us with the flexibility to issue senior debt from time to time. Depending on market conditions, we expect to access the debt market in the near term in order to raise additional capital at the holding company level.", "Now moving on to our 2015 outlook. Please note this outlook is for the full year 2015 versus the full year 2014, and the balance sheet numbers are based on full year averages.", "Starting with loans. We expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-20s, a significant increase over our preliminary outlook of the low double digits that we provided in October. This increase is driven by better-than-expected loan growth in the fourth quarter. As you may recall, we said we could have upside to loan growth from private equity, and that is indeed what happened in the fourth quarter.", "We expect average deposits to grow at a percentage rate in the low 30s, also an increase from our preliminary outlook of the high 20s. We expect net interest income to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens, again an improvement on our preliminary outlook of below double digits. As Greg pointed out, we are not expecting any meaningful help from interest rates in 2015.", "We expect our net interest margin to range between 2.4% and 2.6%. We expect credit quality to remain comparable to 2014 levels. Specifically we expect our allowance for losses for performing loans, net loan charge-offs and non-performing loans to be comparable to 2014 levels. We expect core fee income to increase at a percentage rate in the mid-teens, which is consistent with our preliminary outlook. And finally, we expect non-interest expense to increase at a percentage rate in the mid single digits, again consistent with our preliminary outlook.", "In closing, we delivered very strong financial performance in Q4 and for the full year 2014, meeting or exceeding all of our balance sheet growth and credit quality metrics and exceeding our initial outlook for net interest income and core fee income.", "Moving in to 2015, we remain optimistic due to our healthy and growing client base and our continued success in implementing our growth strategy. While low rates and intense competition will remain challenges in the near term, we believe we are well-positioned for 2015.", "Thank you. And now I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "And our first question is going to come from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hello everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Maybe I'll start. So, period-end assets grew almost 50% in 2014. And at this pace you'll become the CCAR bank it looks like in 2016. So my question is, is there a plan B to slow the deposit growth beyond the off-balance-sheet product which is having a relatively limited effect? Or are you guys bearing the costs and just fully anticipating that you're going to become a CCAR bank over the next one to two years?", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Steve, this is Greg. I'll start and Mike might want to add as well.", "The growth we saw in the fourth quarter was exceptional, and we do believe that's a little bit faster than what we'd ordinarily see. A couple of things. As we've said in the past, and we're not waiting for this to happen, but it is -- it will eventually happen and it will be a catalyst for moving some of those deposits off the balance sheet, and that's when rates start to increase.", "We hope, and I know a lot of the banks are hoping the same thing, that sometime in 2015 that'll happen. And that will have an impact on being able to move that deposit -- to move those deposits off balance sheet. Second part is, we talked about this in the past, but we have a strategy to move more of the money off balance sheet through incentives, being more focused on ensuring we get the right return over the overall relationship.", "So I think there's a variety of different ways that will slow down the growth in overall assets, we approach $50 billion. That being said, we do expect we will be hitting $50 billion at some point, whether it's 15 months out or 24 months out. We could see that happening. And as we talked about, we've been preparing for that for a while both from a systems perspective and processes, hiring the right people that will help us get there. So I think that's how to answer it. I don't know, Mike, if you'd add anything.", "Mike Descheneaux", "No, I think that's fair.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. That's fair. And then a question on this capital call growth. Could you guys talk about what was the largest loans book? I'm trying to get a sense if this was a couple of very large credits or how granular it was. And can you talk about how the duration of the capital call portfolio changed through the year? Maybe it ended. Because I know the PE lines tend to be longer duration. Thanks.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Steve, this is Mike. I'll give -- I'll start, and then Marc Cadieux can jump in here. But when you get a chance to go through fully the press release, you'll note in there that we have the concentrations of loans greater than $20 million, and so you'll certainly see a large rise in the balances related to private equity that are greater than $20 million. We had some disclosures in there that [inaudible] the number of loans increasing there as well. But I think the main point to say is that, yes, there were a fair number that were over $20 million certainly during the quarter.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yup. I think I would add to that -- this is Marc Cadieux -- would add to that that it was driven primarily, as Mike had mentioned before, by utilization, versus having added a lot of new borrowers in the quarter. I think net-net there was maybe 20 to 25 new meaningful credit facilities added in the quarter for new clients, and the rest of it really all came from the utilization.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. And I know this has been a focus, but when you look at this growth, I think, Greg, you said that you tend to see a jump at period-end, but we've never seen a jump to this magnitude. Is this quarter a game-changer for that business the way you guys view it?", "Greg Becker", "I'll start, Marc. This is Greg, and Marc may want to add to it.", "The growth was we've seen the spike as we have in prior quarter -- Q4s, but this was a more significant jump than we've seen in the past. Again, thinking about the utilization rates, kind of going from a 28% to a 38%, that's substantial across a portfolio like that. We just believe it was a complement [ph] of events where we've added new clients over the years and the activity levels at the end of the year was just very strong.", "As Mike pointed out though, we did see a -- we've already seen a decline in those balances so far in the first part of the year, and we could even see period-end, at the end of Q1, period-end balances be lower as we've had in some prior years than we did at the end of the year. So it's somewhat of an anomaly but it also has been an area of focus for us as you pointed out.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yeah. The only thing I would add to that is I certainly don't expect that utilization will stay at 38%. It's probably going to shake somewhere between the 28% and 38%.", "And going back to, realizing belatedly we didn't answer your question about duration, the private equity funds do tend to borrow a little bit longer, but that difference in duration is, you know, tends to be 180 to 270 days versus the typical capital call borrowings of 30 to 90 days. And just looking at the portfolio and where the borrowings came from, it's more the shorter-term variety than the occasional longer-term borrowings we get from certain of our fund clients.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. I appreciate that color. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you, Steven. And our next question is going to come from Casey Haire from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Casey.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies", "Mike, a question for you on the debt raise. Number one, can you just give us a reminder of how much cash is currently available at the hold column, what that might -- that opportunity might be to downstream to the bank. And then secondly, last spring's equity raise, I believe you guys settled [ph] for about an 8.3 tier leverage ratio. Should we expect something similar this time around?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Well, first off, related to the question, I mean we've been maintaining roughly between $280 million and $300 million or so of cash at the holding company level for the last couple of quarters. Now in our prepared remarks, as you said, is we did file that shelf registration this morning. We did say that we expect to raise debt in the near term, but we haven't commented any specifics of that if we do indeed go.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies", "Okay. And then just as a follow-up, on the expense guide kind of holding steady, pretty impressive leverage. I know in the past when you guys have upped your revenue guide, that has brought along the expenses with it. Just curious as to what -- how you're able to keep the expenses flat. And if we were to get further, you know, a better story as the year develops on revenues, would that leverage still hold or would you in fact up the expense guide?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. So, Casey, this is Greg. And you remember obviously historically how this works, which is we set out certain targets. We reset kind of our incentive comp towards those targets. And then if we exceed those targets, the incentive compensation would grow, which is typically where we have seen higher expense levels than our original forecast. And so the same holds true this year, which means we've set out our guidelines, and if we were to see performance over and above that, you could see incentive comp increase, which would take us to potentially beyond the ranges that we've talked about already.", "Casey Haire - Jefferies", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you, Casey. Our next question is going to come from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thanks. Afternoon everyone. Good, strong quarter.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "The release highlighted that new clients accounting for about 27% of the period-end deposit growth. How is that contribution ranked or ranged to historically? And is it outsized now because of the larger financings these companies are getting?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So, Joe, we haven't really commented that often on that number the last couple of quarters. But I would characterize that as a bit higher than usual. I mean what comes to my mind is somewhere between 15% and 20% is what it had been at, the few quarters that we had disclosed, so I would characterize this one as a bit higher.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And do you think that's partly a function of these larger financings, or what do you think's driving that?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Joe, this is Greg. Clearly these substantial rounds have contributed to that. You know, if you go back in history, we -- I can't ever recall rounds of financing that are, on a private basis, that are $300 million, $400 million, $500 million, maybe even a billion dollars, of -- in a single round. And so clearly that contributes to both the number that you described just with -- and with the overall deposit growth.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then, any sense of the timing of when you might hear back on your application for a local currency license in China? And can you just talk about how you see that helping the growth of your business over there?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. So this is Greg again. As I said in my comments, we just filed for it in early January, so, a few weeks ago. And clearly when you're dealing with the regulators, you don't know exactly when you're going to hear back. Our hope is that kind of a late summer, later half of the year, we would hear back, and hopefully be moving forward with that. Right now we continue to develop our systems and processes to be able to have the RMB capabilities, assuming the approval goes through.", "And how it helps is really this. We've been operating in the JV with a little bit of our two arms tied behind our back, meaning we have to operate in foreign currency, meaning onshore U.S. dollars. There just really aren't that many onshore U.S. dollars or foreign currency there, although we've grown that business. So really being able to do RMB or local currency really provides us upside for really the long term. That's really a key fundamental part of our strategic plan, so that's why we highlighted it as an important milestone in our development.", "Mike Descheneaux", "So, Joe -- one item to remember is that it is a joint venture. And so if there is any growth in there, let's say in terms of loans, you're not going to see those loans consolidated on the balance sheet. You're just going to see it as an equity pickup in the line item on gains on investment securities or gains of losses.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you, Joe. Our next question is going to come from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Just following up a little bit on the growth on the VC/PE side. Were you seeing -- was most of that on early stage or late stage? Or where in the scale would you saw a lot of that growth is coming from in terms of what they were funding?", "Greg Becker", "So, Jared, this is Greg. And because it's a private equity, this would be more mature companies. These are cash flow positive companies typically. And we break down -- we kind of have venture capital, private equity services all under one bucket, venture capital and private equity. Again most of these came from private equity, which is later-stage, mature companies, EBITDA positive, is where really those are being funded into, in a variety of different industries. So that's where the majority of that came from.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. All right, thanks. And then on the asset quality, the impaired relationship of $27-1/2 million, is that a multiple loans or is that in one loan? And what bucket of categories would that be?", "Marc Cadieux", "Jared, this is Marc. The uptick in non-performing loans was related to a single loan that falls under our software niche, and it's not indicative of any systemic trends or anything else that we think would cause there to be additional challenges in our loan portfolio.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you, Jared. Our next question is going to come from John Pancari out of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Good afternoon guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Wanted to see if I can get just your thoughts on the concentration of the PE, VC portfolio. It's now about 31% of loans, and obviously it's impacting the margin here. So, wanted to get an idea how to think about that concentration. Could it move up from here or do you expect that this is probably the peak level where you'll let it be?", "Greg Becker", "Hey, John, this Greg. I'll start, and then Marc Cadieux will add some commentary to it.", "So we obviously, we have concentration limits that we look on a regular basis, and private equity services is approaching that level, which makes sense. When you start looking at any loan segment that would be a third of your loan portfolio, you got to pay attention to it. That being said, it is by far our lowest risk part of the loan portfolio historically. Again, across our capital call lending, we have approximately zero losses over the 20 years we've been doing it. So we feel very good about that. That being said, you're still watching it.", "What's important to note, and Marc commented on this and so did Mike, is that the growth was, in the fourth quarter, was mainly about utilization. So when you think about that, Marc said it's going to go back to, we believe, a more normalized level, somewhere between a 28% and 38%, that's a big drop. And so that, combined with the fact our portfolio, the rest of the portfolio, we expect to continue to grow, will keep that in balance. We still have room to grow, but we're watching what the utilization rate will settle in at.", "Marc Cadieux", "I think Greg covered the highlights and I think -- it's Marc -- the only thing I would add goes to your comment about yields. Continued growth in that segment of the portfolio would be expected to have continued pressure on our NIM.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And then also on the -- back to the leverage ratio, the fact that you mentioned the debt shelf and that there's a potential near-term ways [ph] to address it. Can you talk about the mix? Is it primarily, you know, are you kind of implying here that it's primarily going to be debt, or could there be an equity component?", "Mike Descheneaux", "You know, John, what we filed this morning was the shelf registration specifically for senior debt securities.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Got it. All right. And then, Greg, you commented that you don't expect much of a benefit in 2015 from Fed hikes. Is that only because you're expecting the hikes to materialize mid to late 2015, and accordingly, the full-year benefit really wouldn't materialize till 2016? Or is there something about the balance sheet positioning that you think could mitigate the near-term impact?", "Greg Becker", "So, John, this is Greg. You know, it is almost exclusively related to the fact that we expect it to happen towards the end of the year. What we've, you know, if you go back a few years, we had what would be clarified as SVB Prime, which was at a higher level. We've been converting almost exclusively to regular prime, which means that when rates do start to pick up, that will actually be almost across the portfolio. Roughly more than two-thirds of the portfolio is variable rate, floating rate, which means that that would be impacted when rates -- short-term rates finally do impact or go up.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, John. Our next question is going to come from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey guys. Good afternoon. A quick question, Greg, just outside of the PE and the first quarter impact on the loans. Like if you can talk about what you're seeing in terms of client activity that could drive growth, in line with your guidance or better, just in terms of what are the dynamics there in terms of increased liquidity coming for all these companies, vis-\u00e0-vis the borrower demand or the growth that you're seeing when you talk to your lenders in these businesses?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. So this is Greg, Ebrahim. So there's really two things when I think about growth. There's the new client additions and the loan growth from that and liquidity deposit growth. We've already talked about the deposit growth or total client funds. We still see it being robust. Our goal is to just continue to direct more of that off balance sheet.", "And just to comment about that a little bit. I do believe it will temper a little bit because growth, when you think about total client funds growth last year on an average basis, $14.5 billion, 2014 over 2013, that's just such an incredible number. I don't expect it to grow at that level. But new client activity we expect to continue to be robust.", "Now on the lending side, again, what's important to note is, although private equity services gets a lot of attention because that's been such an outsized component of the loan growth, even if you take that away and look at the average loan growth of the rest of the -- kind of industries that we serve, meaning buyout loans, private equity service -- or global private banking, corporate finance, we saw growth across that whole area consistent with what tram [ph] lines we've talked about before which is kind of an absolute numbers of kind of $1-1/2 billion of growth per year.", "So we expect that mix of growth to be consistent with what we've seen in the past. Our teams are seeing that. We see those opportunities. And it continues to go back to being in this innovation market.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Understood. And I'm sorry if I missed it, did you provide an update in terms of the international, the Europe portfolio, where we were at the end of the quarter? And what was the growth in the fourth quarter?", "Greg Becker", "We didn't specifically in the fourth quarter. Here's what I would say. We finished the year with more than $1 billion of total global loans, meaning -- and it's mainly concentrated in three markets obviously which would be the U.K., Asia non-joint-venture, and third, it would be Israel. Those are kind of the three buckets. And the accumulation of those three was over $1 billion.", "So we saw very nice growth this past year. And as I said in other earnings calls looking at a year-over-year growth, what gets us excited is that that's a market -- those markets collectively, you could see 30%, 40%, maybe 50% growth on an annualized basis, which is one of the reasons we're in those markets.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you, Ebrahim. Our next question is going to come from Aaron Deere from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Hi. Good afternoon everyone. Most of my, I guess, big questions, had been addressed. I just have a couple of quick follow-ons. One is I guess, following on with the global strategy question, because you guys have had such good success on that front and given that India is, you know, seems to be such a strong innovation market, I was hoping you could give a little bit more color behind your decision to sell the India finance subsidiary area.", "Greg Becker", "Yes. So this is Greg, let me start. We've had -- we've been successful, to your point, and especially in the U.K. and in Asia. But I'll tell you. It's hard work. You have to deal with additional regulatory constituents in those markets, the operational complexities. And also we want to make sure we're not spreading ourselves too thin. So what we continually do is look at opportunities to say, does this still provide a long-term growth objective for us?", "And so we really sat back in the last 12 months and looked at India and said that we've, you know, our long-term strategy was to set up a branch there at some point, a banking operations. And when you looked at the regulatory environment and the challenge that we had, we actually were turned down for a branch license a couple of years ago, we just said it's better for us right now to double down on what we're doing in Asia, double down on what we're doing in the U.K. You know, longer term, maybe look at Europe, and just be even more focused. And we believe that's the right thing for our clients, it's the right thing for our long-term strategy.", "That being said, we still have, as we've talked about in the past, a group called Global Gateway, which means we still have a team of people that still goes to certain markets such as Brazil, Australia. And as companies are looking to come to the U.S. or come to our other markets, we want to capture the best companies that are coming to those markets. And India will remain in that category.", "So this isn't something like we're giving up on India. It's just we're taking a different approach for now because we've revised what our view is of the long-term outlook for our business.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "That's great. Thanks, Greg. And then, Mike, just to make sure, the -- is it safe to assume that your -- the outlook that you've provided includes whatever volume of sub-debt you might be taking on?", "Mike Descheneaux", "No.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Aaron. Our next question is going to come from Julianna Balicka. Please go ahead with your question or comment.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Afternoon.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "I have a couple of follow-on questions. One, in terms of thinking about your reserve coverage, you said that you want to keep the reserves to performing loans comparable to 2014 levels, which at the end of the quarter had that tremendous growth in PE, which is one of your lower loss ratio portfolio. So as that flows off, should we be thinking about a lower overall dollars of reserves or will the existing dollars of reserves just get reallocated so we may see an increase in coverage ratios?", "Greg Becker", "So, Julianna, this is Greg. I'll start on the -- in looking at it. I would say going back, and being very focused on what we said, we think about the non-performing ratio, coverage ratio being consistent, we look at that from a performing loans, exactly the way it's -- we look it'd be consistent generally with this past year. So clearly there's changes that could happen in the portfolio. But you have continued improvement in charge-offs, assuming that trend continues, meaning looking at the reserves, kind of what we look at reserves relative to our charge-off ratio. So you have that factor happening, combined with the mix of the portfolio, which kinds of leads us to believe that the, again, coverage ratio for performing loans would be consistent.", "Marc Cadieux", "The only I think I might -- excuse me, it's Marc -- would add to that, is that non-performing loans, while they went up in the quarter, are still very, very low at only 0.2% -- 0.27% of total loans. And so, yeah, any movement upwards to I'll say a more normalized level of non-performing loans could offset whatever benefit we get in the performing loan segment from higher capital call lending.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "I see. That makes sense. And then in terms of the capital call lending pulling back during next year, and you had referenced flat to potentially down loan growth, would it snap back to 3Q levels or would it just trend down from where it is here? Like there's some segment that it's going to stay in there in terms of the overall dollar growth?", "Greg Becker", "So, Julianna, this is Greg. Let me start. So when I talked about a potential decline or flattening in period-end or consistent levels, I'm talking about Q1, so, meaning we could be a Q1 period-end decline. That being said, we still believe, I certainly believe that we'll still end up seeing growth overall in private equity services.", "What we wanted to highlight though is we don't expect -- didn't expect and will not expect the tremendous growth we saw in the fourth quarter continue. And now, because the utilization rates will come back down, do we believe we'll continue to add new clients?", "In a similar, maybe a little bit slower pace that we did to 2014, yes, we do. We expect to add new clients in the private equity services arena. The slight decline of utilization would actually just slow down the overall growth. But it would still see growth.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "I see. Okay, that makes sense.", "And then final question, if your loan growth, or if your balance sheet growth rather, exceeds your current expectations, what is the risk that we may see higher expense growth related to getting ready for CCAR crossing $50 billion market, et cetera, or is that fairly well-phased-in so we may actually not be shocked by a spike in expenses so to speak?", "Mike Descheneaux", "As Greg was mentioning, that we've been preparing this for quite some time, so you actually have certain level of expense run rate that's in there related to preparing for that. So I think you'll continue seeing us prepare and invest in people, resources and systems. But at this juncture, we don't necessarily anticipate a big, massive spike in the new elevated higher level anytime soon. Hopefully that can change, but at this point we have a good run rate in our expense growth.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Very good. So we should expect any expense -- higher expense surprises to come basically from positive growth and therefore incentive comp?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Well, so compliance costs and things like that, preparing to get to $50 billion is one thing. And then -- but when you talk about incentive compensation, so on other words, if we continue to grow and exceed our targets, as Greg was mentioning, you're certainly going to see an increase in incentive compensation if people exceed their targets. So again, fairly similar to what we have seen in the prior years when we exceed our targets. Hopefully that makes some sense to you.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Yeah, that makes sense. Thank you very much.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you, Julianna. Our next question is going to come from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust. Please go ahead with your question.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you. Good evening. Just curious if you have any borrowers that have outsized exposure to the energy industry at this point?", "Marc Cadieux", "This is Marc Cadieux. Excuse me. The answer is no, we do not.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you very much.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yup.", "Operator", "Thank you, Jennifer. Our next question is going to come from Brett Rabatin from Sterne Agee. Please go ahead with your question.", "Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee", "Yeah, hi. Good afternoon. Wanted to just ask, and I remember last quarter you kind of mentioned that you'd kind of seen a ratcheting of price competition in several of the business lines. And I was just curious, thinking about the fourth quarter and what you're seeing today, how that played out through the quarter and kind of how that's looking so far in 2015 in terms of what transpired the past maybe six months.", "Greg Becker", "So, Brett, this is Greg. I guess our comments about the competitive landscape have been kind of a consistent beat we've talked about for the last few years, and it hasn't changed. It's very competitive out there. As we said in the past, we continue to really sharpen our pencil, looking at deals and saying, is this the right deal based on both a risk and a return metric?", "The good news, as we said in the past, and again we talked about this for years, is we're in a really an unenviable target market. There's two benefits to it. One is the market's growing, so that's a good -- that's a really good thing, you kind of have the wind at your back. Second part is we really spent a lot of time looking at how we can add value to our clients, and I know that's an overused term, but when you think about it, because one of our teams have concentrations of you're a software lender or a hardware lender or a clean tech or something, your expertise and your ability to add value is much greater than other institutions. And you combine that with the information that we're sharing and the other connections and relationship building exercise that we go through, that's really valuable. Our clients value that relationship and they value what we bring to them. So that's what we're doing.", "And then you combine that with the broad product set we have, so like a broad product set which delivers majority, if not all their needs. You've got value-add that delivers it in a very unique way that we believe is, you know, no one else can do. That's a big differentiator.", "It doesn't mean we can't, you know, we don't have to sharpen our pencils. We do. But I think we have an advantage over our competitors. And our goal is to make sure that advantage remains.", "Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee", "Okay. That's great color. And then I guess the other thing I was curious about was, Greg, you talked about in maybe the past quarter or two, a little bit of frothiness, and some other things you were saying. But it sounds like you're pretty comfortable with a lot of the valuations that you're seeing in some of these companies today and maybe more certainty about the prospects for cash flow and what-have-you. Would that be a fair characterization of kind of how you view the market?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. There's kind of two aspects when you think about valuations. There's the credit aspect of it. And I think sometimes people think about that valuations -- if a valuation -- company goes from $100 million to $250 million or $300 million and it goes back from $300 million back to $100 million, that all of a sudden the credits -- there's a risk to the credit. And for the most part, that's actually not true. So we look at credit, and as Marc has articulated, we feel very good about where we are from a credit perspective of keeping with our underwriting standards, et cetera.", "And this other part of just, you know, valuations and what do we look at and how do we feel about valuations? As I said, valuations have absolutely increased. And some of the valuations are, I'll use the words, very specifically priced for perfection. That being said, we have, in my history, have never seen the growth rates -- revenue growth rates of these companies and the market opportunities they're going after.", "So I'm not the expert to tell you whether the valuation, it's a $5 billion or $1 billion or $10 billion is the right level, but I will tell you that the companies are performing exceptionally well. And when you look at public markets, you kind of say, yeah, they do in some cases make sense. But it is at the higher end clearly.", "Brett Rabatin - Sterne Agee", "Okay. Thanks for the color.", "Greg Becker", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you, Brett. Our next question is going to come from Gary Tenner from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.", "Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson", "Thanks. My questions have been answered.", "Greg Becker", "Okay.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you.", "[Operator Instructions]", "And our next question is going to come from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Great, thanks. Just in terms of your loan growth this quarter, how much of the loan growth came from acquisition-related financing? And how's that changed over the last couple of quarters?", "Greg Becker", "So if we go back to private equity, by extension, that would have been acquisition financing done by our private equity clients where they borrow on the capital call lines. Separate, apart from that, sponsor-led buyout was up in the quarter, but not dramatic. I believe it's about 10% growth for the quarter -- 11% growth for the quarter.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, it's approximately about 6%. And what we noticed in Q4, Ken, was, you may recall, in Q2, Q3 was some headwinds on the loan growth in these areas, and then we did -- it was kind of nice to see actually Q4 it rebounded and starting to show growth. This is the sponsored buyout area of our portfolio.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it, understood. Sorry, just to go back to the first part, you said it was based on the private equity guys were doing on the capital call lines? Is -- I assume that's very temporary financing. I guess I was thinking more of the longer-term financing.", "Greg Becker", "Right. So the longer-term financing would be the sponsor-led buyout.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it.", "Greg Becker", "That we saw the 6% growth in.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, Ken. Our next question is going to come from Tyler Stafford from Stephens, Inc. Please go ahead with your question.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon guys. Just a follow-up on the global portfolio. I know you got a global loan balance at yearend, but I was hoping you could get the global deposit balance at yearend. I think it was $4 billion last quarter. And then just any thoughts of crossing that $10 billion of foreign exposure threshold?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Tyler. This is Greg. If you would have asked that question a quarter ago, I would have said $10 billion is a really far -- far away. But we actually approached $7 billion -- in fact we were a little over $7 billion deposits on a global basis.", "Now there's a couple of things that are in there that I think is important to note. We have focused less on creating an off-balance-sheet opportunity than what we have in the U.S. And if you would take the same mix on and off in the U.S. and apply it to global, you'd end up with about $3-1/2 billion on, $3-1/2 billion off. So that's a big area of focus for us, coming up with products that can move more of that money off balance sheet, which we're planning to do. So I believe we've got the right focus on moving more of that money off balance sheet right now. But we did see a very nice tick-up in foreign deposits or global deposits.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Greg Becker", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you, Tyler. And at this time we have no additional questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Greg Becker, CEO, for closing comments. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Thank you.", "I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. You know, 2014 was a great year. When you look at the numbers, we are just thrilled with the growth that we've had. And it really is, you know, the growth was great, the credit quality was strong, great client acquisition. And we're just really fortunate to have the clients that we have, which we certainly believe are the most interesting and vibrant companies in the world, and really a key to our success. I want to thank all of them, and thank the SVB employees for making this such a great year.", "And as we move into 2015, we're going to continue to invest in being the best partner and delivering value to our clients. As I said, that's really the key differentiator for us. It goes beyond just being kind of a simple banking relationship. And we're really all committed to ensuring that we're really building a strong franchise for the long term.", "And with that, I want to thank all of you guys.

My name is Bakibha [ph], and I will be your operator for today's call.", "[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Meghan, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Bakiba [ph], and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here today to talk about our first quarter 2015 financial results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of the management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and the actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan and thanks everyone for joining us today. The first quarter was a very strong start to the year. We delivered quarterly earnings per share of $1.71 and net income of $88.5 million significantly beating street expectations.", "These results reflect continued healthy conditions for our clients and strong execution which enabled us to deliver 10.6% average loan growth, 4.7% average total client funds growth and 5.2% core fee income growth. We also saw substantial gains on equity warrants and investment securities. Our strong performance is due to three primary factors, first our focus on the innovation Markets and their investors. Second, our commitment to adding value to our clients. Third, our effective execution on our growth initiatives.", "The innovation Markets which have helped provide outstanding growth for us continue to thrive. VC's raise $7 billion in the first quarter compared to $5.8 billion in the fourth quarter. This continues momentum in fund raising combined with resources from angels, incubators and corporate's has provided an ongoing supply of ample capital for good companies.", "USVC Investment remained healthy in the first quarter with $13.4 billion invested in 1,020 deals. This is a strong number, nevertheless we're paying attention to investments that are early stages which have declined in the past four quarters to see whether that decrease may impact our new client acquisition and so far, it has not.", "At just over 1,000 new clients in Q1. We were on par with the pace of the last five quarters or four quarters. The VC backed exit Markets remained healthy. Although Q1 numbers were down following an exceptionally active Q4 in 2014. The innovation economy continues to outperforming the broader economy and our annual innovation economy outlook offer that evidence that many companies are delivering strong performances and are generally optimistic about the environment. 76% of the 1,100 executives and entrepreneurs we survey this year said their company met or beat revenue targets in 2014 and 71% expect even better conditions in 2015.", "This is the second highest level of optimism among our survey respondents in the six years; we'd be doing this research. These factors are all contributing to momentum in our business. Momentum we are reinforcing through our unique ability to add value to our clients. We do this through our deep connections and long experience with innovation companies and their investors. Our ability to move and adapt quickly to client needs and our ability to partner and connect clients with resources and people.", "Let me give you just a few examples of how we do this. In just the past week, we introduced 12 of our most promising client CEO's to corporate development, business development and product leads of a NASDAQ 100 company interested in potential opportunities for partnership and acquisition. We also hosted a conversation with one of the most accomplished successful investment venture capitalist and a small number of client entrepreneurs, so that they could ask questions and hear the VC's views on the state of the industry.", "We also recently partnered with one of the leading accelerators to bring together 20 of their hot portfolio companies many of them are clients, with 20 corporate's interested in investing partnering and acquiring. And we brought a group of Oregon entrepreneurs to Silicon Valley to meet where they had the opportunity to talk and make connection with VC's.", "We heard just this week, that one of these entrepreneurs is expected to get funding as a result of this meeting. These are just a few examples of what we do every day in our Markets. Making hundreds of touch points on every front. Advising, helping and connecting our clients with the people, expertise in resources to help them move forward. This approach, our passion about making a difference for our clients is what creates that strong bond and sets up apart from every other bank.", "Our strong client relationships have enabled us to maintain our leadership among start ups and increase our market share in key client segments such as private equity and the private bank. Our focus on private equity in particular has enabled us to win nearly 300 new clients in the last year and has contributed significantly to grow loans, total client funds and fee income.", "Likewise, our private bank initiative although still relatively small is growing rapidly with more than 500 new families added in the last year. These efforts have dovetailed with our global growth imitative contributing non-US loan balances that reached $1.2 billion during the first quarter, a 36% growth year-over-year.", "We continue to make progress in our global initiatives and expect to see strong annualized growth in that area. Our successful efforts to track clients have also been helped by continued advancement or enhancement of our global product offering. Some recent examples of this, where our move to a 24x7 foreign exchange desk in Q4 and a launch of our business debit card in the UK in the first quarter.", "And finally, we are optimistic our China joint venture will receive its license to lend and take deposits in RMB sometime this summer. So we have a positive outlook because we have a variety of growth initiatives. But our success at winning and keeping clients is also about working with the best companies. We've devoted significant resources to identifying high performance companies using metrics other than valuations such as margins, revenue and growth rates as well as our unique access and insights into our target Markets.", "We are succeeding at this and our focus in working with and cross selling to the best clients group is driving high quality results. While vibrant client Markets have driven strong growth they come with some challenges, which we discussed on past calls. Increasing valuations are something we are paying attention to, while many companies are achieving clients and revenue traction that appears to justify their valuations some will not live up to expectations.", "We believe building deeper relationships with the best companies is the right strategy in this environment. In addition, our deep engagement and long experience in innovation Markets are significant advantages in managing our business. We continue to see heated competition. With some lenders taking risk on loan size and structure that we believe are unjustified. We are choosing everyday to be disciplined about growth even when it means walking away from a deal.", "We said that $1.5 billion to $2 billion is an optimal annual range for smart loan growth over the coming years. Assuming the Markets hold and we remain comfortable with those levels. Finally, we are keeping an eye on our asset growth. Given the higher regulatory bar for banks with more than $50 billion in assets because we are a commercial bank with a holding company structure, we have been investing in a robust regulatory and compliance infrastructure for years.", "With that in mind, we expect more of a continued ramp and a sudden leap in expenses. We are also active in DC to raise the $50 billion threshold. Since we think $50 billion is too low for designating a systematically [ph] important financial institution.", "As we look at our first quarter performance and our outlook for 2015, we are pleased with our continued momentum and optimistic about the year ahead. Our client base is growing and doing well and the broader economy continues its march to recovery. Short of a major economic disruption, we believe we're on track to deliver another strong performance in 2015.", "We have not assumed much help from rates this year, but every day is a step closer to a rising rate environment, which we expect will have a tremendous positive impact on our business. In the meantime, we remain focused on executing on our growth plans being the best at what we do and maintaining a reputation as the go-to partner for innovation companies and their investors worldwide.", "Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO. Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg and good afternoon, everyone. As Greg, noted we had a very good quarter across the board. I would like to highlight a few items in my comments today, which I will cover in more details shortly. First, healthy average loan growth. Second, strong growth in total client funds. Third, higher net interest income and modest margin compression. Fourth, a lower provision due to flat period-end loans and continued solid credit quality. Fifth, higher non-interest income due to strong investment securities gains, warrant gains and core fee income. Sixth, solid capital ratios which reflects the impact of our recent debt raised and new Basel III requirements. And finally increased expenses in the impact of seasonal compensation items and growth in FTE.", "Let us start with loans, as we expected. Period-end loans were stable at $14.4 billion reflecting a modest degree of repayment on capital call lines of credit that was offset by modest increases in other segments of the portfolio. Average loans grew by 10.6% or $1.3 billion to $14 billion reflecting the impact of our substantial period-end loan growth in the fourth quarter. Capital call lines of credit have proven to be somewhat more resilient than we anticipated and utilization of capital call lines of credit remained elevated at 6 percentage points higher than normal.", "While we continue to see good momentum and an active pipeline, our commitment to smart growth for the long-term means we would expect the pace of the loan growth in the coming quarter to trend towards an annualized run rate in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion assuming no changes in the Markets.", "Now let us move to total client funds which includes both on balance sheet deposits and off balance sheet client investment funds. In the first quarter, average total client funds grew by 4.7% or $3 billion to $67.5 billion due primarily to continued healthy funding and exit Markets for our clients. In a shift from previous quarters, growth in our off balance sheet funds exceeded growth of on balance sheet deposits, due to our ongoing efforts to use those products when appropriate.", "Average client investment fund balances grew by 5.5% or $1.8 billion to $33.6 billion. This growth was driven primarily by a early stage and private equity funds and much of it occurred in our off balance sheet suite product, which is approaching $10 billion. Average deposits grew by $1.3 billion or 3.9% to $33.9 billion also driven by our early stage and private equity clients.", "On a period-end basis, deposits were down at $33.9 billion compared to $34.3 billion in the fourth quarter. On the other hand, period-end client investment funds increased by 8.7% or $2.8 billion to $35.2 billion. Again, we believe this shift is due to our increased focus on ensuring our clients are using the right products and we will monitor deposit levels with an eye towards potentially tampering our outlook for deposit growth if our efforts continue to succeed.", "Moving onto net interest income and net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $4.1 billion or 1.8% to $239.3 million in the first quarter despite too fewer days in the quarter. The increase was driven primarily by higher average loan and fixed income securities balances as well as lower deposit interest expense. This was offset by lower loan yields and an increase in debt expense related to our senior debt issuance in late January.", "Interest income from loans increased to $3.7 million to $165.5 million driven by loan growth. The loan yield fell by 27 basis points as a result of loan growth in lower yielding private equity capital call lines and lower prepayment activity in the loan portfolio. We expect loan mix, completion and a low rate environment to continue to press loan yields moving forward.", "Investment interest income increased $1.3 million to $82.5 million driven by higher average balances of fixed income securities, which increased by $499 million or 2.4% to $21.1 billion. The yield on the total fixed income portfolio remain stable at 1.58% primarily due to the benefit of fewer days in the first quarter.", "New purchases of $1.3 billion in the quarter consisted of US Treasury and Ginnie Mae Securities with average yields of 1.66%. Portfolio duration remained relatively stable at 2.7 years. Moving on to our net interest margins. Our net interest margin declined slightly by two basis points, to 2.64% driven by higher balances of investment securities and lower yields on loans due to loan mix and lower loan fees.", "Now turning to credit quality. It remained strong overall during the first quarter .we recorded provided of loan losses of $6.5million compared to $40.4 million in the fourth quarter which was elevated due to significant period-end loan growth. The majority of the provision in the first quarter was due to specific reserve related to the problem software loan we talked about last quarter. This increase was offset somewhat by five basis point our reserve for performance loans to 99 basis points.", "This reduction was attributable to portfolio mix that favour capital called lines of credit which continue to experience excellent credit quality. Net charge off remain very low at $3.9 million or 11 basis points of total gross loans. Gross charge offs of $5.5 million came mostly from our early stage clients.", "Non-performing loans increased by $6 million to $45.5 million in the first quarter and also remain low at 31 basis points of total gross loans. Now let us move to non-interest income. GAAP non-interest income increased by $4.4 million to $172 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income which is net non-controlling interest was $108.9 million compared to $90.3 million in the fourth quarter.", "We encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. The major components of non-GAAP non-interest income were $58.2 million of core fee income, $20.3 million of gains and warrants and $19.6 million of gains from private equity and venture capital related investment securities.", "Now I'll go into the details of our non-interest income. We had private equity and venture capital related investment gains of $19.6 million net of non-controlling interest compared to $16.6 million in the fourth quarter. The strong first quarter gains were split between valuation increases from positive investment and exist trends for our clients and related gains from distributions inclusive of a $3.3 million from the sale of our remaining investments in FireEye.", "We had equity warrant games of $20.3 million of which $10.9 million was related to four companies. Valuation increases accounted for $16.5 million of the gains with the remaining $4 million due to warrant exercises. We are pleased with the performance of these investments in the first quarter. However, it is important to note that while we continue to see elevated gains from these lines items, these gains are significantly greater than average historical levels.", "Turning to core fee income, core fee income remained healthy increasing 5.2% or $2.9 million to $58.2 million. Core fee income includes fees from foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credit, as well as deposit service charges, lending related fee and client investment fee and as a non-GAAP measure. Again please refer to the non-GAAP disclosure in our press release for more information.", "The increase in the first quarter was due primarily to higher credit card volumes which drove interchange fee income and higher letter of credit volumes. Foreign exchange fees were lower by approximately $900,000 during the quarter following a record fourth quarter, although we continue to see pressure on spreads.", "Moving on to capital, our capital levels remained healthy. In the first quarter Basel III requirements became effective and as a result our holding company risk based capital ratios decreased during the quarter, primarily as a result of new risk waiting requirements for unused loan commitment and equity investments.", "Total risk based capital decreased by 54 basis points to 13.38% and Tier 1 capital decreased by 49 basis points to 12.42%. Our bank level capital ratios increased due to our $350 million debt raise, the proceeds of which we downstream to the bank. Our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio increased by 79 basis points to 7.43% and our bank level total risk based capital ratio increased by 123 basis points to 13.35% inclusive of the impact of the new Basel III requirements.", "We continue to closely monitor the trend in our capital ratios. The bank level, Tier 1 leverage ratio in particular and at this time, we expect it to remain within our target range of 7% to 8% for the remainder of 2015. Turning to expenses, non-interest expense rose by $10 million to $196.1 million. This increase was mainly due to an $8.5 million increase in compensation and benefits expenses as a result of seasonal increases in 401K contributions and payroll tax expenses as well as higher FTE.", "Moving onto our outlook, we are on track to meet our 2015 guidance in all categories with the exception of expenses. We are raising our expense growth outlook for a mid-single digit to the high-single digits driven by our strong performance and the expectation of higher incentive compensation related to that performance. Outside of this performance related increase in incentive compensation expense, expense growth is in line with our expectations.", "In closing, we are pleased with our strong financial performance in the first quarter. The momentum we are seeing in our Markets in continue execution of our growth strategy. Growth levels and valuations are extremely strong given the current rapid growth rates in the innovation Markets. We are well positioned in our Markets, however the challenge is posed by low rates against the backup of intense competition have underscored our commitment to reasonable and smart growth and building for the long-term.", "Thank you and now I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] and our first question is from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "I've a question regarding loan growth. Your capital call lines, they're only declined a bit it looks like for the quarter, I had expected a bigger decline than what you saw, so can you just give us a little bit color on what you're seeing there on those balances and how should we expect that they trend in coming quarters?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, John this is Greg and then Marc Cadieux, Chief Credit Officer will add to it. So we did see a little bit less of a decline than we thought as we saw a significant run up from the fourth quarter, so that was good for the average growth in the quarter. And I think, it goes back to what I said earlier, we're still seeing a lot of activity. We had a great growth in the fourth quarter, but it still was a very active quarter both on a venture capital and a private equity basis plus, you know we continue to add clients.", "The combination of those things is still allowed to be a solid quarter albeit obviously slightly down from Q4.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes, I think the only thing I would add to that is that our growth is in recent years has been increasingly tilted towards the private equity fund end of the spectrum and those funds tend to borrow larger amounts and keep them outstanding for longer periods of time then and I think that is contributing to what maybe becoming a new normal in terms of utilization of credit facilities in that segment of the portfolio.", "John Pancari", "So it's more sticky, it's not a timing factor.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes, I think that's yes.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right and then separately, if I can just top over to expenses. Just a higher level question again, I think you've been asked this in the past. But I want to see, if you have an update on how SVB is preparing on the regulatory and infrastructure side in preparing to cross $50 billion in assets. I know you're just shy of $40 billion now, but can you just possibly give us some more detail on where you're spending and where you stand in that investment process?", "Mike Descheneaux", "John, this is Mike here. We've been investing and ramping up for quite some time. I mean just given the nature of our model and how we bank? We've been required in looking at a look other requirements for the $50 billion for quite some time such as the capital stress testing, such risk appetite statement, such as risk committee on the board and so forth. So we feel that we're on the right track, but certainly there is always many things to do. The regulators do continue to raise the bar and expectations and that will continue overtime, but nonetheless again we don't expect as Greg was saying any massive ramp up in expenses, but certainly you know expenses will continue to grow overtime related to these areas, but again we just don't expect anything to just jump up significantly overnight.", "John Pancari", "Okay and then last, if I could just ask one more, just around the increase in the NPA's the two loans. Can you give us just a little more detail on the industry and the type of credits and also were they, they weren't loan participations, were they?", "Marc Cadieux", "No, they weren't. This is Marc Cadieux. Both loans, the additional split almost evenly between the two. There is no trend or commonality in terms of industry, those loans were both 100% ours. And that's pretty much it.", "John Pancari", "Okay and were they hardware credit?", "Marc Cadieux", "One would be in our software portfolio, the other would be broadly described as clean tech.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great thank you.", "Mike Descheneaux", "And maybe just reiterate, I mean on the non-performing loans of which you were referring to, is just they remain extremely small overall John. I mean, when you look at it, we have $45.5 million which only represents 31 basis points of total gross loan. So again very solid levels.", "Marc Cadieux", "I think that's right and the other comment would be that, more than half of our non-performing loans remained centered in that one loan we talked about last quarter.", "John Pancari", "Great, okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "Just want to finish up from the asset quality there. With the growth in the allowance for the impaired loans, having them [indiscernible]. Should we expect to see some charge offs increasing in the future quarters from that and so, do you think the allowance is adequate here specifically around those less than that?", "Marc Cadieux", "So most of the increase in specific reserves is related to that one problem loan from the fourth quarter that we referenced. It's too early to tell, how that will turn out, but I'd say for the moment. I'm feeling confident that would be reserve is adequate, both for that loan and then overall.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay and then shifting to loan growth. What was the growth in the accelerator early stage sector, this quarter? So specifically what was the dollar of the growth in the end of period balance and any dollar growth of billings over $20 million?", "Mike Descheneaux", "This is Mike, so we'll come out with the detailed disclosures by segment here over the next week or so, as we get closer to the 10-Q. So we'll have that updated detail information for you, but perhaps maybe Marc, just general color of what we're seeing in this, the loan in that area.", "Marc Cadieux", "Generally, our loans in software niche continue within broader technology to be in the strongest through the rest segments.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay and then I guess, finally do you anticipate the water crisis in California is going to have any negative impact on the premium line business, is early to stress the portfolio for that or you migrating any of the loans to hire risk revenues, given the drought?", "Marc Cadieux", "So our current view is that, it's Marc Cadieux again. If the drought were to continue for another couple of years then, invariably it is going to have some impact on harvest and ultimately output, but it's really I think too early to tell and certainly too early for us to be changing credit risk ratings for example, with regard to that segment of the portfolio.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, great and just finally. Given how assets sensitive the loan, the deposit mix is in the core balance sheet. Would you consider going further at curve at all, with the investment portfolio or should we expect in going forward that is to say, really short.", "Mike Descheneaux", "No, I think at this point the duration we have in the portfolio is very sensible. Particularly when you consider the size of our investment securities portfolio in relation to our total assets. So at this point, the notion or the idea of going out longer in this lower rate environment, I just don't see it's really going there.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "I just wanted to focus back on sort of your statement on loan growth and expectations of $1.5 billion to $2 billion in annualised loan growth. I guess, we think through in terms of where period-end loans were at the end of first quarter. Is it fair to assume granted quarter-to-quarter volatility that, we should grow loans around in that $1.5 billion to $2 billion annualized range going forward?", "Greg Becker", "So Ebrahim, this is Greg. I will start and them Mike or Marc may want to add it. But what we said is because we had such a strong fourth quarter and the average of loan growth and the first quarter was so significant, we really just wanted to go back and calibrate for everyone to say, as we look out and we said this, as you know for the last few years. We said that, kind of $1.5 billion to $2 billion per year is where we're comfortable at, but we could see some higher growth than that in certain areas and one area we would highlight and have highlighted is private equity services, which is what the fourth quarter was all about and the average growth in the first quarter was really tied to.", "So if you kind of normalize that, you get back to that range of kind of $1.5 billion to $2 billion. So we're really just kind of giving what we would say, kind of forward look on what we expect and what we anticipate so that people can build that into their models.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "And let me ask this another way, you mentioned the capital call lines have been stickier than you sort of initially expected. Do you see those balances declining meaningfully from where they were at the end of the quarter? Given sort of the overall activity within that space.", "Marc Cadieux", "You know, it's, this is Marc Cadieux here. It's always challenging to forecast what the borrowings will be for that segment of the portfolio or generally speaking, you see repayment coming, but then you don't know how much of that will be replaced because it's so dependent on deal activity, which has remained robust. Certainly now for a second quarter, we see a higher utilization and that is being driven I think in the main by the private equity fund borrowers in the capital call product and I'm well, two quarters is perhaps not a long trend given that we're increasingly weighted towards private equity, given that they do they to borrow for longer period to time.", "It's becoming in my mind at least increasingly likely that what have been more our historical normal utilization in the mid to high 20s could be creeping up into the mid to high 30s, time will tell.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Fair enough, I've got that and just on a separate topic. I think, Mike talked about and increase in off balance sheet fund I think for the first time in many quarters exceeded on balance sheet deposit growth. Is that, sort of can we read into that and think that that's the first of the next few quarters in terms of the strategies that you've instituted and the success of that in terms of being able to move these clients off balance sheet or too soon to tell?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg, I would love to tell you, we have this perfect dial that moves it on and off balance sheet, but that clearly isn't the case. So what we really try to do is create balance, but really again as Mike said, get our clients and the right products for them. So if we were to sit back and said, what would be, if I did have a dial, what would that look like the dial would be, the growth rates that we talked about, that really about half would be on the balance sheet, about half would be off the balance sheet.", "Now if you look at last year and the year before that, it was mainly on balance sheet with a little bit going off and the first quarter we saw more go off. So you may see a quarter-to-quarter swings, you know maybe one quarter goes more in balance sheet, one of the quarters that will go more off balance sheet, but if we were to say what's that threading needle look like about half of the growth would be on and about half, it would be off.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "That's helpful, thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "Thank you. And now our next question is going to come from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead with your question.", "Aaron Deer", "Circling back to the subject of expenses. I know there is a lot of seasonal noise in the first quarter, but I was wondering if any of the lift that we saw this quarter, might be part of the compensation that you talked about and that some of that might be tied to the outsized warrant and equity gains in the quarter and then related that with respect to your guidance, is there any way that you can breakout kind of how the expense increased with respect to comp [ph] breakout between say performance, expectations versus new producers that you're hiring versus say the kind of regulatory cost that you're taking on?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So, Aaron the first part of your question is in relation to let's say incentive compensation warrants and investment gains. So the answer is yes. So some of the increase in expenses is related to those outsized gains, that we did have. The second part of your question, I would just perhaps refer to you when we come out with the 10-Q that will have more of that disclosures and breakdown of expenses related to the questions that you're asking there.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay and then, since you highlighted the private bankers, one of the other areas we saw, some better growth this quarter, I [indiscernible] talked about much not definitely part of the portfolio, but I'm just curios. Can you give us a sense of how that book breaks up between say real estate secured product in mortgages versus restricted stock loans or unsecured lines? What all this kind of in, what you consider be the private bank book at this point?", "Marc Cadieux", "So very consistent with Mike's last response. We'll have more detail and more breakout there in the 10-Q. Broadly speaking though, real estate and primarily mortgage lending would have been the majority of average loan growth in the first quarter.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going come from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "Thanks, good afternoon everyone and congratulations on another strong quarter. I guess first just following up on the growth in the off balance sheet deposits. Just wanted to give you kind of provide an update in terms of some of the actions, you're doing to help drive that activity along those lines, I noticed that quarter-to-quarter rates paid on your money market deposits and your now deposits on balance sheet were down quite a bit and I wondered if, some this activity is being just encouraged by lower pricing that's driving people off balance sheet?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Joe this is Greg. I'll start and so as part of it, but I would say it's really the bigger driver was really just getting attention on it. And really having our sales, team's our relationship teams being able to articulate to our clients. Where there options are and you know encourage them to look at off balance sheet and again, historically and I would say it's still not easy to do it because whether even if we move our, what we're paying for on balance sheet deposits 5 basis points or 7 basis points. It's still isn't that much, there really isn't very much yield to get either on or off and so it really is just educating clients on how to create kind of more a balance in having your maybe long-term or long-term cash off balance sheet and your shorter term cash on balance sheet.", "So I would say it's probably more education, than anything else.", "Joe Morford", "Okay, fair enough that's helpful. I guess other question was just on the global network. I noticed, VC investment activity in London specifically is been steadily growing and actually up significantly in the first quarter. I just wondering, if you could give us an update on how the UK strategy is progressing and also an update on where we stood at period end in terms of footings and all?", "Greg Becker", "So Joe, this is Greg. When I look at, how UK is going, I would say it's at or exceeding expectations and we've talked about over the last few years. We've said that's an area of growth and we expect that area to grow kind of in that what is originally in the early days to kind of 40% to 50% growth and kind of temper that a little bit to kind of 30% to 40% growth and that's really where we have ended up.", "As I mentioned in my comments, the global loans are really, they hit about $1.2 billion at the end of the first quarter and when you look at those numbers. There are more of it, is in the UK and Israel. So roughly $800 million in that category and about $400 million in what I'll call Asia and so when I look at that, you're going to see that growth. I would say pretty consistent from kind of growing proportionally to those two numbers, but still very good about what's happening in the, we had a great team and it's both again, the point is to make is, it's not just working with UK companies, but it's also working with the mix of US clients that are going setting up operations in the UK and banking them there as well. And that's the added benefit and that's why the client account is growing and that's why the loan growth is increasing in a nice pace there as well.", "Joe Morford", "Okay and thanks so much, Greg.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, thanks Joe.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is going to come from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead. Go ahead, Jennifer your line is open. Jennifer, if you're on mute, please un-mute yourself.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Why don't we move on to the next question.", "Operator", "Okay, thank you. So our next question is going to come from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Onto start, when you about getting ready across $50 billion, we've seen other banks like New York Community and First Republic slow their growth to give themselves more time. You guys seem like you're pretty far ahead of the curve in terms of investing, but what that in your prepared comments, you did say you're keeping a close eye, you're lobbying you need to tweak the strategy at all to give yourself more time to cross or do you think you're potentially ready at this juncture?", "Greg Becker", "So Steve this is Greg. Couple comments and one is, I don't think ready yet for it, but I just want to pile into Mike's comment about kind of expense growth that we've seen. I really believe we talk about this a lot, that we're more prepared than most banks to eventually cross a threshold because of what we've had to build over the last 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years and again as I mentioned you got - holding company structure that adds additional complexity that we've had prepared for.", "We operate in an international basis, which we're prepared for. There is a lot of other things that we had to do, we have been doing stress testing. All these things that I think are really laying the foundation that we've done. I would say, the team's done an excellent job on, so I feel really, really good about that. There are things that we would have to do, no questions. But as we've done a high level analysis of it, we sit back and I guess there really isn't on a lot things that I would lose sleep over kind of crossing that $50 billion threshold.", "So that's kind of one side of it being prepared for it. The second part is, then is are we at all slowing growth because we're worried about crossing it and we were not, we look at, the growth that we have whether it's deposit on or off balance sheet. It's really a function of, the growth in our client business. It's having our clients and the right product, the right time and it's looking our capital ratios and so we have done, what we believe the right thing is to ensure that, even if we do have more deposit growth that our capital ratios are going to be in good shape.", "So we're definitely not slowing growth in fear of crossing a $50 billion threshold.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, so the increased success in the quarter of moving deposits off balance sheet, isn't not related to a strategy to give yourself more time?", "Greg Becker", "No, it goes back to what I said. One way of the questions which is, if I were to be able to have the perfect dial for me would be kind of 50% on balance, a 50% off balance sheet. But of course on a quarterly basis, we can't dial it in that close. Which means that again some quarters, you're going to more on, some quarters you're going to have more off and the first quarter was just more went off?", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay and then shifting gears. Looking at the decline in the period-end software loan. I'm assuming that was sponsor led buyout, slowed a bit is my guess, can you talk is the competitive environment heating up or did the market just slow a bit? Thanks.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hey, Steve. So I'll let Marc talk about kind of what quarter-to-quarter fluctuation, but let me comment about the competitive landscape on sponsor led buyout. So the sponsor-led buyout is absolutely a very competitive market and what we have seen is, more firms are looking to chase yield and clearly that's one area where yields have been up on a higher level basis, when they have been that way for quite a while. Although clearly the margins have gone down from their peak.", "What we're seeing is, you're seeing some bank competition, but you're really seeing more non-bank competition again from one of the reasons I talked about it, had a good track record from a credit quality perspective number one and number two. You know the yields there are better. So you're seeing more senior lenders and you're seeing more mezzanine lenders and they're willing to put pretty aggressive terms on the table.", "So a lot of refinances and a lot of that is being driven by competition and the availably of what I'll call more flexible, cheaper debt. That being said, we're still seeing a lot of opportunities and what I'll say, as I said on the call. We're kind of picking the deals we want to play and then which ones we want to kind of pass on.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes and that might be the thing I would add, since growth in sponsor-led buyout slowed roughly four quarters ago, what I've been encouraged by in notwithstanding leverage levels that have gone up and increased competition. Leverage levels that have gone up in the market I should say in terms of loan demand and increase competition was encouraging to me that we're still seeing good opportunities from good sponsors, who value the speed, uncertainty that we bring in helping them close transactions and that, going back to the smart growth that we mentioned.", "How our ability to continue to win business but win it without reckless level of leverage or weaken loan structures is again for me that's pretty encouraging.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, maybe just one final one. You had a nice quarter in the Life Sciences area, are these new client wins or you're seeing clients get more active, just any color there? Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. Steve. Aside it's across the board. We have an exceptional team in Life Sciences and I think they have their hand on the pulse of the market probably better than anybody else, I would argue and so that's helpful in deciding what I had said earlier, which is I guess is very important in all markets, but it's especially on Life Sciences that to make sure you're working with the best companies the ones that have, if it's a drug company the ones that multiple drugs out there and not just for letting on one drug going to market and if that drug fails, but the whole \"in question\".", "So they're incredibly thoughtful about it and I think the combination of having this team together for a long period of times allows them to pick deals and they've been very successful in the first quarter they have been very successful. Last year on our market share and that market is actually been increasing.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, take care Steve.", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] our next question is going come from Julianna Balicka. Please go ahead.", "Julianna Balicka", "In terms of your outlook, in terms of the deposit growth that you're looking for in your outlook, what kind of rate environment are you assuming for the rest of the year in that outlook?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So our rate environment is pretty much what the forward curve is showing. So essentially fed funds rate increased towards the very end of this year just one small modest one. So I wouldn't say that, the rates would really have a whole lot of impact on us for 2015.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay, so if one were to hypothetically have an assumption that rates would raise sooner or further, then one should lower deposit growth assumptions with idea that, with higher rates, more deposits would slow off balance sheet.", "Mike Descheneaux", "You know in theory may perhaps for a lot of other banks that is probably true. But particularly for our clientele, you typically at least what we've seen historically is where is the first couple rates moves, tends not to have a dramatic impact perhaps when rates are more up 100 basis points, 150 basis points. Then certainly you're going to have perhaps more attention to the rate increase and perhaps more dialog on moving deposits from on balance sheet, off balance sheet, but if it's just a typical 25 basis point move initially one time it tends not to have a dramatic effect, initially.", "Greg Becker", "Julianna is that, again we have a lot of balances, off balance sheet and that's more of the long-term cash, that's the one that is really paying, should be paying more attention to from a yield perspective. The more the operating cash which is on the balance sheet. Our clients tend to burn through that relatively quickly and replenish it with another rounds of equity financing.", "So again to Mike's point they spent less time thinking about what yield is around that, just because it's shorter term cash.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay, I see that makes sense and then another question, if I can back to the $1.5 billion to $2 billion kind of long-term kind of healthy loan growth rate. As you grow bigger, should we think about that range expanding with your balance sheet growth because you're incrementally adding lenders or is that range kind of going to be consistent whether you're $40 billion or $50 billion because that's kind of healthy and digestible in terms of underwriting and picking up the best client from your target market?", "Greg Becker", "So Julianna this is Greg. And if you look at the next, I would say few years. I think you're going to be in that range again, there may be something that move it up or down, but I think that range as I said, we feel pretty comfortable eventually, as you look out as certainly we may expand in other areas, global maybe taking off accelerating even if it stays at this pace. It will grow at a faster, at an absolute dollar. So those are the things that could have an impact. But I think again the next few years in that category $1.5 billion to $2 billion, we feel pretty comfortable", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay that makes sense and then in terms of your reserve coverage with the growth in PE and VC loans in your portfolio when we look out, right now in the benign credit environment, but when we look forward a more normal credit environment, what is the kind of reserve coverage of VC, PE loans in your book that would be appropriate as we think about, where your reserve coverage may go where, through the past cycles.", "Marc Cadieux", "So it's Marc Cadieux, certainly private equity loans or capital call lines are credit in our portfolio. As well, I guess I'll back up here. For the 20 years plus that we've been doing this, we never had any loan losses in that segment of our portfolio and so long as that remains true. The concentration that we have with that segment of our portfolio should in affect help keep loan loss reserves to a more a lower level, than they otherwise would be say, if it was a smaller part of the portfolio.", "Greg Becker", "And only to add on to that Julianna is again, even though Marc's obviously accurate about the not having losses. We still take reserves against that obviously because we can't, we don't - -can't believe that will happen forever. So when you look at the performing loan coverage the roughly 100 basis points. So the more you add, right there would be pressure just from a accounting perspective to move that down. What happens to the overall mix because we could expect critical losses will increase if we start to see a bump in the road. But you're right, if all things being equal, if we continue to PES the same rate, you would see that number more than likely being driven down under performing basis.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay that makes sense and then in terms of FTE, since you added this quarter. Could you provide us a little bit more color, are these front line lenders or are these back office personnel infrastructure compliance?", "Greg Becker", "Yes it is definitely a mix across the board. You can look at people in the UK its operations, it clearly on the compliance side and the risk management side, front line sales. There isn't one area that you look out and say, oh! my gosh the quarter was way weighted in one category and quite honestly it\u2019s been that way for quite a while. If you go back the last two years or three years to Mike's earlier point. We probably had an increase in the proportion going to risk management in compliance, but again it hasn't been a huge number. It's just increase as a percentage over the last few years.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay that makes sense and then finally could you remind us, what the duration of the PE versus the VC capital callings are?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, like all things there is a spectrum but generally the venture capital side of the capital call line portfolio tends to repay quicker and repayment terms tend to be on average more in 90 days to 120 days period. Repayment terms on private equity funds by comparison can have repayment terms between 180 days to 270 days sometimes 364 days. Again not all firm keep their advances out that long, some pay back more quickly, some pay back less quickly. But generally speaking it's about 1.5 times to 2 times longer outstanding for the private equity and this for venture capital.", "Julianna Balicka", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Great, thank you and at this time, we have no additional questions. I will now turn the call back over to our CEO, Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Great. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We're really pleased with the first quarter and as Mike and I both articulated. We feel good about the momentum we have and the outlook for the balance of 2015. We described some challenges that we were dealing with and it's just part of the market that we're in it, it's competitive because it's a great market and we got low interest rates and we're watching the compliance cost related the $50 billion as we approach it. But all those things we feel good, we have under control.", "At the end of the day, we just remain focused on execution, long-term plans and strengthening our position as the financial partner to the market that we think is the most interesting and most dynamic market and that's the innovation ecosystem. I want to thank our clients for trusting us. It's just remarkable every single day, we look at our clients and I do believe we have the best client, period end of story and also thank our employees for making those client relationships possible.", "So thank you everyone for joining us and look forward to talking to you, next quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Eilanda, and I will be your operator for today's call.", "[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to the SVB, Director of Investor Relations. Meghan O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Eilanda, and thank you everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here today to talk about our second quarter 2015 financial results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during the call and the actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan and thanks everyone for joining us today. We had a solid second quarter, reflecting healthy conditions for our innovation clients, our success at adding new clients and our unique ability to add value to those clients. We delivered quarterly earnings per share of $1.66 and net income of $86.1 million, again exceeding street expectations.", "Our core endure remains strong. Our market share in all segments is the highest it\u2019s ever been. We\u2019re seeing healthy activity across to all client stages. Highlights of the second quarter included, average clients funds growth of $7.9% or $5.3 billion, most of it in our off-balance sheet funds. Core fee income growth of 13.6%, primarily from foreign exchange and credit cards, net gains $39.5 million in warrants and invest securities, net of noncontrolling interest, solid credit quality despite an increase in our provision in nonperforming loans, an ROE of 11.4% for the quarter, which places us near the top of our peer group.", "And when you see the average loan growth during the second quarter was tempered by our standards at 7.8% annualized due to repayments on private equity capital to call lines. We saw healthy growth across virtually all of its segments of our portfolio. We remain on track to meet our full year 2015 guidance of loan growth in the mid 20% range and we\u2019re also reaffirming our expectations going forward for the annual average loan growth in the range $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Our result\u2019s the product of our continued focus vibrant innovation markets, our support of the entrepreneurial eco system and our ability to execute on a long term strategic plan.", "I\u2019m going to cover five areas in my comments today. The health of the innovation market, client acquisition, our growth initiatives, SVB\u2019s unique value add and challenges. The innovation markets remained strong in the second quarter saw continued robust investment in exit activity. Venture capitalist invested $17.5 billion in nearly 1,200 deals, a 30% increase in terms of dollars and a 13% increase in the number of deals compared to the first quarter. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of more than $10 billion of venture capital invested in a single quarter and the highest quarter of investing since 2000.", "Venture backed IPO activity increased significantly from the first to the second quarter with 27 offerings worth $3.4 billion. SVB\u2019s market share of US venture backed innovation companies going public was 55% in the second quarter. While the number of venture backed M&A deals declined 20% during the quarter, the disclosed value of those deals increased by 86% to $4.1 billion.", "We maintained a strong pace of new client acquisition in the second quarter, adding more than 800 new clients, nearly a 20% annualized growth rate. These new client winds were dominated by early stage companies as is usually the case and we all saw healthy gains in our global markets and the private bank. We continue to see strong activity among our innovation clients at all stages and that activity has driven healthy balance sheet and fee income growth for us.", "We also have a number of growth initiatives, which we talked about over the years, including global expansion, payments and the private bank and I\u2019m going to highlight some recent accomplishments in those areas. As we announced last week, our joint venture bank in China has been granted approval by the China Bank Regulatory Commission to operate in RMB. This license will allow the joint venture bank to provide banking products and services to clients in local Chinese currency, the significant milestone in our global initiative and our long term growth strategy.", "Our global momentum is building. Global loans now represent 8% of average loans and global deposits represent 18% of average deposits. Our global strategy is also contributing to fee income helped by a 128% increase in global FX trading revenues year-to-date and a 55% growth in global payments and cash manager revenues. Likewise, our payments business is gaining momentum, driven by a diverse in growing client base and by a role is the payment processing engine for several of our fintech clients. These two drivers contributed to a year-over-year increase 38% in card revenue and 65% in ACH revenues. We believe our payments business will be a growing portion of our revenue over the next several years.", "Our private bank is another area where we\u2019re seeing accelerated growth. Thanks to our continued focus on delivering a differentiated client experience. Average balances of private bank loans grew at an annualized rate of 44% in the second quarter, fueled by healthy mortgage lending and significant new client growth. We expect the private bank to remain a long term growth driver for SVB. Our ability to add values fueled by these initiatives, I\u2019ve just talked about and that value add contributes to our continued market leadership in the innovation space.", "In addition as we surround our clients with the products and services they need both business and personal, our unique ability to make meaningful connections for clients is a significant advantage. For instance, last quarter we brought together 85 virtual reality companies, corporates and investors in our WeWork space in San Francisco. The event was a chance for these leaders to meet each other and discuss potential opportunities, generated tremendous positive feedback and demand for similar events in other markets. The similar event in Boston, we brought together more than 100 investors, corporates and disrupters in the big data space for a day and a half of keynotes, panels and one on one meetings.", "We\u2019ve heard from many of the participants that this event has already led to revenue generating connections for them and others made valuable contacts that will help them move their business forward. We make these kind of connections and hundreds or more for clients every day. The clients are focused on turning these ideas into reality, on building their business and doing it fast. They come to us for the value we bring to that process. Our ability to make a difference for them is part of our DNA and is significant advantage for them and for us.", "As vibrant as the innovation markets are, we still face challenges. Despite our strong performance, persistent low interest rates limit net interest income upside. However, as you know, we\u2019ll benefit significantly from a rising rate environment. The competitive environment remains heated. Strong funding and exit markets have increased the amount of liquidity in the markets and barrowers have money options. As a result some vendors up here are willing to go to any length to win business regardless of whether that risk justifies that return.", "Finally the regulatory burden for banks of our size is significant. While we had and we\u2019ll continue to invest our regulatory and compliance infrastructure, we expect the regulatory bar will continue to rise. Despite these challenges we remain optimistic about our opportunities in our markets. We see ample opportunities to lend, although we remain focused on delivering high quality smart growth, our experienced networks and talented people and our ability to add value differentiate us and we continue to leverage that differentiation to meet our market leadership. And we have a long term strategy for this diversified growth that has proven to be and continues to be the right strategy. We\u2019ll continue to execute consistently on that strategy, as we have for years.", "We\u2019re pleased with our second quarter results and remain positive about our growth prospects. There is no shortage of opportunity. The key in our view lies in delivering the right kind of growth. The focus and discipline and the efforts of a talented and dedicated employees, we believe we can make the most of our near term opportunities or positioning ourselves to take advantage of the significant long term opportunities that lie ahead.", "Thank you and now I\u2019ll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg and good afternoon, everyone. We had a solid quarter marked by continued strength and income from PEVC related investment securities, warrants and core fees. I would like to highlight a few items in my comments today, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail shortly.", "First, relatively tempered average loan growth and lower peered in loan balances. Second, substantial growth in total client funds particularly in off-balance sheet client investment funds. Third, higher net interest income despite a lower net interest margin due to loan mix, loan rates and a competitive environment.", "Fourth, solid credit quality despite a higher provision and higher levels of nonperforming loans. Fifth, higher non-interest income due to strong gains from warrants and private equity and venture capital related investments and a record quarter for foreign exchange as well as credit card and payment fees. Sixth, solid capital ratios and finally seventh, higher expenses due primarily to increased incentive compensation driven by our strong performance.", "Let\u2019s start with loans. Average loans grew by $273 million to $14.3 billion, driven primarily by loans from our private bank. In general, we had good growth in all areas except private equity and venture capital. We saw significant levels of repayments on PE capital call lines of credit in the second quarter, repayments that we had expected but did not see in the first quarter.", "I do want to note that average loan balances for PEVC capital call lines were flat in Q2. Repayments of private equity capital call lines were also the primary driver of lower peered in loan balances, which decreased slightly by $186 million to $14.3 billion. These decreases were offset somewhat by healthy peered in growth in buy outs and private bank loans.", "As Greg indicated, we remain on track to meet our full year 2015 loan growth outlook. While Q2 was relatively slower in terms of loan growth, we\u2019re seeing strong momentum across most of the portfolio and we have a solid pipeline. That momentum should also help us meet our expected growth rate going forward of $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually, which we noted in Q1 would be an optimal level of growth.", "Now, let us move to total client funds, that is combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. Average total client funds grew by $5.3 billion or 7.9% to $72.8 billion. This growth was due to continued healthy funding and exit markets for our clients and strong client acquisition.", "Peered in total client funds grew by $6.7 billion or 9.7% to $75.7 billion. Consistent with last quarter a significant amount of this growth occurred in our off-balance sheet client investment funds and is the result of our efforts to place our clients in these products when appropriate.", "Average client investment fund balances grew by $4.2 billion or 12.6% to $37.9 billion. This growth was driven primarily by early stage, corporate finance and private equity clients and most of it occurred SVB asset management, which is approaching $20 billion in average balances and in our off-balance sheet product, which crossed the $10 billion threshold during the quarter.", "Peered in client investment funds grew by $4.9 billion or 14% to $40.1 billion, driven by our early stage growth and corporate finance clients. Average deposits grew by $1.1 billion or 3.2% to $35 billion. This growth was due primarily to our private equity and early stage clients.", "Peered in deposits grew by $1.7 billion or 5% to $ 35.6 billion, driven by early stage and private equity clients as well. Our efforts to ensure our clients are using the right off-balance sheet products are having a positive impact across many client groups. As a result we\u2019re lowering our full year 2015 deposit growth outlook from the low 30s to the high 20s, although as we know from past experience, things can change quickly.", "Moving to net interest income and the net interest margin, net interest income increased by $4.8 million or 2% to $244.2 million in the second quarter. The primary drivers were an increase of $1.8 million in loan interest income related to average loan growth and one additional day in the quarter.", "Loan interest income was impacted by 10 basis point decline in loan yields due to loan mix and the competitive environment. Investment interest income increased by $3.3 million, primarily driven by a decrease in premium amortization expense and mortgage backed securities due to the impact of higher market interest rates on prepayment estimates.", "Average balances of fixed income securities increased by $296 million or 1.4% to $21.4 billion. The yield on the total fixed income portfolio increased slightly to 1.6% compared to 1.58% in the first quarter. New purchases of $1.5 billion during the quarter consisted of US treasury and Ginnie Mae securities with average yields of 1.39% and 2.07% respectively.", "Portfolio duration remains stable at 2.8 years. Our net interest margin declined by 6 basis points to 2.58%, primarily due to lower loan yields. Now, turning to credit quality, overall our credit quality remained solid despite an increase in our loan loss provision and levels of nonperforming loans.", "Our provision for loan losses was $26.5 million, compared to $6.5 million in the first quarter. This increase primarily reflected an increase in specific reserves of $21.1 million related to two impaired loans in the software and internet portfolio, one a buyout loan and one an asset based loan.", "Net charge offs were extremely low at $1.7 million, compared to $3.9 million in the first quarter. This reflects lower gross charge offs at $4.7 million, compared to $5.5 million in the first quarter. The two impaired loans mentioned previously were the primary contributors to an increase of $58.4 million in nonperforming loans to $100.8 million.", "Despite this increase nonperforming loans had 70 basis points of total gross loans are well within our acceptable operating range. We would expect nonperforming balances to remain at these levels for several quarters, despite the fact that we\u2019re optimistic about resolving these newly impaired loans. With that in mind, we\u2019re signing a range of 60 basis points to 100 basis points for 2015 nonperforming loan balances, which is higher than our original outlook, but again still within our acceptable operating range.", "Outside of these items our loan portfolio performed as expected during the quarter. We\u2019re reaffirming our 2015 full year outlook for net loan charge offs between 30 basis points and 50 basis points and we expect to come in at the lower end of that range. Likewise, we\u2019re reaffirming our outlook of an allowance for loan losses for performing loans, comparable to 2014 levels.", "Now, let us move to non-interest income. GAAP non-interest income increased by $2.8 million in the second quarter to $126.3 million, compared to $123.5 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP non interest income, which is net of noncontrolling interest was $117.7 million, compared to $109.4 million in the first quarter.", "We encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. WE adopted a new accounting standard in the second quarter that allows us to deconsolidate certain non-controlling interest and report only amounts related to SVB\u2019s ownership in certain private equity and venture capital related fund investments. It affects most, but not all of our private equity and venture capital related fund investments.", "On the balance sheet you\u2019ll see the impact of the revision, primarily in reductions to Non-marketable securities balances and noncontrolling interests for an overall balance sheet reduction of approximately $1.1billion. On the income statement the largest impact was a reduction to investment securities gains and losses and noncontrolling interests.", "It is important to note that there was no impact to Q1or Q2 net income or SVB\u2019s stockholders equity. You can refer to the press release for details. For the requirements of early adoption we have applied a new accounting standard to the first and second quarters of 2015, but we\u2019ll not be revising periods prior to January 1, 2015.", "Major components of non-GAAP, noninterest income in the second quarter were warrant gains, PEVC related investment securities gains and core fee income. We had warrant gains of $23.6 million, compared to $20.3 million in the first quarter, driven primarily by strong IPO activity, which included a realized gain of $13.9 million related to our warrants and Fitbit.", "Valuation increases accounted for $9.1 million of the warrant gains. Warrants continue to provide healthy upside to our earnings, although we do not do these elevated levels of gains as sustainable. We have private equity and venture capital related investment gains, net of noncontrolling interest of $15.9 million compared to $19.1 million in the first quarter.", "This included $9.5 million of gains from distributions in our strategic and other investments and $5.4 million of gains from our managed funds of funds, primarily related to unrealized valuation adjustments.", "Turning to core fee income, core fee income was strong in the second quarter, increasing 13.6% or $7.9 million to $66.1 million. Core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credit, deposit service charges, lending related fees and client investment fees and is a non-GAAP measure. Please refer to the non-GAAP disclosures in our press release for more information.", "The increase in the second quarter was due primarily to record high foreign exchange revenues of $22.4 million, driven by higher volumes from our private equity and life sciences clients and by a 15% increase in credit card volumes, which drove credit card fees of $14.2 million. As a result of continued strong performance in core fee income, we are increasing our full year 2015 outlook for core fee income growth from the mid-teens to the low 20s.", "Moving on to capital, our capital levels remained strong overall. Our bank level Tier 1leverage ratio ticked down slightly by 4 basis points to 7.39% due to continued growth in average assets from client deposits. Risk based ratios at the bank and holding company increased across the board by approximately 50 basis points, due primarily to capital generation from strong earnings and lower risk-weighted assets, primarily loans compared to the first quarter.", "Now, turning to expenses, noninterest expense rose $3.6 million to $194.1 million compared to $190.5 million in the first quarter. The increase in expenses was due primarily to $9.1 million increase in compensation and benefits expense related to incentive compensation due to our strong performance year-to-date. All other expense lines in aggregate decreased by $5.5 million, driven in particular by a lower provision for unfunded commitments due to portfolio mix.", "Our non-GAAP efficiency ratio, which excludes related to noncontrolling interests fell by 99 basis points to 53.6% and remains below our target range of 60%. As a result of our strong performance year-to-date, we\u2019re increasing our full year 2015 expense growth outlook from high single digits to the low double digits to reflect higher levels of incentive compensation.", "Before I close, I would like to summarize the changes to our 2015 outlook. One, we have decreased our outlook for average deposit growth from a percentage rate in the low 30s to the high 20s. Two, we have increased our outlook for levels of nonperforming loans from the range comparable to 2014 to a range between 60 basis points and 100 basis points of total gross loans. Three, we have increased our core fee income growth outlook from a percentage rate in the mid-teens to the low 20s. And finally fourth, we\u2019ve increased our expense growth outlook from a percentage rate in the high single digits to the low double digits.", "Our 2015 outlook for other items remains on track. In closing we\u2019re pleased with our solid performance. Our leadership in the innovation economy continues to drive strong flows of client funds and despite a relatively tempered quarter for loan growth, our pipeline and prospects remain healthy. Our expansion to larger and global clients continues to drive balance sheet growth while making fee income a more meaningful portion of our overall revenues.", "We see good opportunities in the market, despite the challenges of significant levels of low cost liquidity and intense competition in our markets. However, we\u2019ll continue to be judicious in delivering the right kind of growth that will position us for long-term success.", "Thank you and now, I\u2019d like to ask the operator to open the line Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Ebrahim Poonawalla. Your line is open.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Good afternoon guys. I think if you can first just start upon, possibility of the two nonaccruals this quarter, and if you can provide any color in terms of what transpired for them to go into nonaccrual, and if we should think of something more systemic going on, partly also driven by the fact that you have increased your guidance for nonperforming loans going forward. So - and I'm just wondering, Greg, Mike, if you're seeing anything out there that concerns you, where you expect recurring small credit issues going forward.", "Marc Cadieux", "Hi, Ebrahim its Marc Cadieux. So first I\u2019m just going to reiterate something Mike said in his opening remarks, which the credit quality does remain solid and nonperforming loans remain we think within our normal operating range at the 70 basis points of total loans. Turning to the two loans specifically, I\u2019d start by characterizing both of them as anomalous. As Mike mentioned, one of them is a sponsor led buyout loan. It\u2019s the first of its kind that has become impaired, since we began the business in 2006, 2007 timeframe, that\u2019s the first thing. The second is an asset based loan and that too is a rare event at SVB.", "I think the way to characterize this sponsor led buyout one is, this is a portfolio that has grown over the last several years and as that portfolio matures, like any portfolio we\u2019re going to see the occasional problem loan in that portfolio. Having said that this particular loan, we\u2019re cautiously optimistic that with time will improve backed by high quality sponsors consisted with the balance of our sponsor led by a portfolio and there is support for the company. And again we were cautiously optimistic that with time that will turn out okay.", "The second one is an asset based loan that a long time client of ours, where their first problems arose in connection with a merger and then was followed up by a bad quarter. And so that one, two punch is what caused the impair bit of that loan, but again cautiously optimistic that with time that will turn around. With regard to the regard to the rest of your question about, do we see anything systemic here and I think you mentioned taking our guidance up.", "As that buyout portfolio matures and is consistent with having then making larger loans, what we recognize is that when these loans become impaired, they\u2019re going to stay in the impaired portfolio for longer and it only takes one or two to move the needle and so it\u2019s in connection with that that we\u2019re taking up our range for 2015.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "That's helpful. Thanks, Marc. And on a separate subject, obviously core fee income showed very good growth this quarter. I'm just wondering, in terms of when we look at the forex fees and credit card fees, was 2Q elevated, and we should fear a reset lower, despite, sort of, the raised guidance? Or, because of the sort of global operations and increased capacity, we are sort of resetting at a higher level from where these things should grow from here?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I\u2019ll take that question and second quarter was an incredibly strong quarter both in cards and in FX. You see a little bit of volatility with the FX because you do see big trades on a quarter-to-quarter basis that can have an impact, so that number may move around a little bit. But on the credit card side that is more consistent, more recurring and so that should continue to go up into the right at that kind of constant pace. That being said, both comments, as I said when I had given my comments, show very good about both those as being key drivers of our growth. The global initiatives that we\u2019re doing both in the UK and in Asia are allowing us to capture a lot more the funds flow and do FX transactions with them and credit cards are combination of both penetration and our client base as well as being more of that infrastructure component to the fintech companies. And as you know that\u2019s something we\u2019re continuing to put more effort behind and so in both cases we expect it to be a very nice growth business for a while to come.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Understood. And if I may sneak in one more last question, is - regarding sort of the China banking license, any sense in terms of how we should think about its impact to the balance sheet, income statement, over the next 12 to 18 months?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, the next - so this is Greg again. The next 12 to 18 months, it\u2019s going to have a little impact there\u2019s only two reasons for that. One is the growth of it, number one and number two is the method of accounting by how we account for that investment. It\u2019s more than investment equity method as opposed to consolidating into our balance sheet. So that\u2019s kind of one aspect, but on the growth side, again we have the RMB license, we\u2019re starting to open up accounts in RMB right now. We\u2019ll have a greater launch toward the end of this year, but we\u2019re going to have a very measured approach. The one thing we don\u2019t want to do is, number one, misstep. Number two, disappoint out clients as we grow that business, so you\u2019re going to see a slow growth over the next 12 to 18 months. Now, obviously the reason we are excited about the license is that longer term, three to five years, we expect it to be growing at a very nice clip and contributing. Again remember it\u2019s using the equity method, so really we plan to come out with more details next year with expectations as far as growth when we look out three to five years.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Thanks a lot for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Joe Morford. Your line is open.", "Joe Morford", "Thanks, good afternoon everyone. I guess, first question's just on the off-balance-sheet funding. This is the second consecutive quarter where we've seen accelerated growth there. Is it really just greater focus internally with your relationship officers, or are clients actually being more receptive to this. And then, related to that, wanted to confirm that the lower deposit guidance was just because you're having more success off-balance-sheet.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, so Joe, its Greg and I\u2019ll answer your second question first, which is that is exactly the case. When you look at total client funds growth and as you know we think about the business that way, or the health of the business. The second quarter was incredibly strong with more than $5 billion with the growth. When you think about mix, you can\u2019t just look at the $5 billion of total client funds, you have to look at the total pool of client funds being $75 billion and so moving a little one direction could cause it to move more off-balance sheet and on-balance sheet and so that\u2019s really what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s getting the clients in the right product and services plus a little bit of a mix. Optimally, again as I said, I would love to see kind of a new client funds kind of evenly split, kind of a 50-50, 50 on and 50 off for this quarter would have been $2.5 billion. It was a little more off, which is okay because as you know that also allows us to strengthen our capital ratios. So from that standpoint, we feel good. The reason that guidance got taken down was because more of the mix was off-balance sheet and we feel strong about the kind of outlook from a total client funds perspective.", "Joe Morford", "Okay, perfect. And then the other question, I guess, probably more for Mike, just looking at the increase in the incentive comp this quarter, how much of that was kind of do your [ph] catch-up, or moving to a new accrual rate given your expectations on performance, and how much may have been specifically tied to payouts in, say, Fitbit or something like that - the outsized warrants. I'm just trying to gauge what might be a better run rate for that going forward.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, Joe, so yes there certainly is an element of catch up going back from the first quarter because this is the way we payout incentive or compensation or accrue for it is, [ph] you look at your full year forecast performance and we certainly had an expectation at the end of Q1 and we moved into Q2 certainly performed in excess of our expectations, so therefore you do raise it up, but you have to go back and catch up from that accrual from the first quarter. So it\u2019s quite a couple of million, I mean it\u2019s probably about $2 million or $3 million, relates to kind of a catch up from the first quarter. But certainly based on what we know today, you\u2019re going to have kind of a run-rate up around that area plus or minus.", "Joe Morford", "Okay, thanks so much Mike.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos. Your line is open.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Hi, everybody. Maybe I'll start, looking at the decline in the capital call lines, you guys - would you call this typical volatility tied to a shorter-duration asset, or is it more a function of the competitive environment causing balances to fall?", "Greg Becker", "So Steve this is Greg. I\u2019ll start and Marc may want to add. From my standpoint, it\u2019s almost exclusively tied to just the borrowing on the existing credit facilities, so kind of short term in nature. And when you look at the press release and go to the detail and you look at the loans greater than $20 million and outstanding for private equity services, that was a pretty big decline and really that is just tied to just temporary the timing of when they borrow and when they repay. So from the stand point we continue to grow those commitments and feel very good about the outlook for that business for growth and so I wouldn\u2019t read anything into that from a competitive landscape. We\u2019re doing exceptionally well in that area.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "And Greg, can you talk about the sponsor-led buyout trends? Looks like those were down in the quarter too.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, I\u2019ll start and then I\u2019ll have Marc add a little bit to it. So the sponsor-led buyout as you know has been a key part of our growth for the last few years and it continues to be part of our growth, it will be a little bit lumpier for a lot of different reasons. But the growth will be slower than what it has been in the last couple of years, mainly for reason, which is the competitive landscape. And unlike the other business, with sponsor-led buyout you\u2019ve competition from banks, but more increasingly you see competition from non-banks, which don\u2019t have the same, both regulatory requirements and have quite honestly lower yield hurdles and can be even more flexible. So from that standpoint, it\u2019s very competitive, but because of the consistency that we\u2019ve demonstrated overtime in that market and the players PE funds, so we work with - we continue to use that as a growth opportunity.", "Marc Cadieux", "It\u2019s Marc Cadieux. The only thing I would add to that is our discipline and what we\u2019ve talked about in the past as being smart growth. Again we think we can grow because of our reputation and the sponsors that we work with, but the growth would be slower than it had been in past years in part because leverage levels have gone up, the market has become more competitive and with greater frequency we have elected not to compete to win business that we thought was too highly leveraged or too loosely structured.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. And maybe just one follow-on question on your comments around moving funds off-balance-sheet. I think you tweaked the incentives for the off-balance-sheet funds last year. Was there any further tweaking of incentives, and is that part of the increase in the expense guidance? Thanks.", "Mike Descheneaux", "This is Mike, Steve. Generally no, I mean really what\u2019s part of the success has been on how we position our products at the outset of a client relationship, which going back to kind of November, where we started and just really taking hold and taking effect and so we\u2019re seeing some nice results as a result of that.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks Steve.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Pancari. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari", "Can you just give us what your criticized loans were for the quarter, and how they may have changed on a linked quarter basis?", "Marc Cadieux", "Sure, this is Marc Cadieux again. So criticized loans were up in the quarter, but still at a - we consider well within the normal operating range at around 6% in total.", "John Pancari", "Okay. So, they're 6% in total now, and then what where they last quarter?", "Marc Cadieux", "Last quarter was 5.2% I believe.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then, also on the credit front, Marc, what was the other $16 million in inflows into mPOS [ph] outside of the two credits?", "Marc Cadieux", "Sure, I would characterize that as our normal early stage activity. So by way of background, historically where we have tended to have nonperforming loans and loan losses has been in our early stage segment of our portfolio and I characterize the balance as that typical in and out and unlike the larger loans we mentioned, those tend to move in and out of nonperforming more quickly than the larger loans do.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And then lastly, also on the credit front, the mark on these two loans, what you put into reserve - that appears somewhat steep. And I guess what I'm trying to triangulate here is, how does that go with your feeling of cautiously optimistic? It just seems like a pretty steep mark.", "Marc Cadieux", "So the way I think about that is the situation now versus the situation over the next, however long it takes for the company to turnaround. We generally will look at situations like this, take a probability based approach and in essence that can lead to day one based on the current said effects, a higher reserve because you can\u2019t yet give them credit for the turnaround they\u2019ve not yet delivered. Having said that, the factors and particularly on the larger one, the buyout loan of having a supportive sponsor willing to commit additional funding to the business, new management et cetera are the things that give us confidence that overtime not withstanding what appears to be a higher reserve that would signal more pessimism, that\u2019s what leads to my cautious optimism. Again they need to deliver that turn around and until we see that we think the reserves are appropriate.", "John Pancari", "Okay and then just one more related to that. Where either of these Shared National Credits? I would assume not.", "Marc Cadieux", "No, neither.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill. Your line is open.", "Aaron Deer", "Hi, Good afternoon everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer", "Greg, I wanted to follow up on a statement you made about the payments business, and I'm guessing that this is tucked in the credit card and FX line items. But you mentioned that some of this growth is coming from your work with third party fintech companies, and I'm just - was hoping you could give a little color behind that, how big that opportunity might be, and if there's any challenges or risks associated with know your customer or AML rules.", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg. How I describe it is, when you think of the fintech companies, these are companies that are - as an example, processing payments for small companies, taking what would normally be paper based approach to vendor payments and moving it to a digital structure. I\u2019m going to think about that as an example. They\u2019re using credit cards or other versions of our payment systems to be part of their infrastructure to actually facilitate the payments. So what happens is we\u2019re looking at facilitating payments in large volumes as they support their clients. So that is an example of what can drive substantial credit card fee income. From a BSA/AML perspective we obviously have expertise in dealing with that, so we have a knowledge of how that operates, number one. We also work very closely with them to make sure that they\u2019re building our their BSA/AML program to ensure it\u2019s compliant with what is going to be required from a regulatory perspective. So we feel very comfortable, we spend more time walking through these payment businesses to ensure they\u2019re compliant than any other part of our business. And so that level of rigor we believe gets us comfort that we\u2019re taking the right approach.", "Aaron Deer", "That's great. How much would you say is the \u2013in terms of the revenues and those line items, is coming from some of these third party relationships versus your core customers?", "Greg Becker", "I\u2019d probably describe it as 20% to 25% of the overall revenue again, but it\u2019s growing at a faster pace than just the normal kind card penetration. So as I said in my comments, we\u2019re excited about this being an increasingly critical part of our business and have a team structured around that. And again why this makes so much sense is, these fintech disruptors are our clients and so if we can help them and be part of their business, be part of their infrastructure, that from our standpoint is - it\u2019s a great win for us and it\u2019s a great win for our clients.", "Aaron Deer", "Sure. If I may, just one quick one for Mike. With the new accounting adoption, I wouldn't expect this would have any impact on the Volcker rule accounting, but just wanted to double-check on that. Is that just a straight-up 3% of Tier 1 capital, or does this change in accounting affect that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "No, no effect on the Volcker rule.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Gary Tenner. Your line is open.", "Gary Tenner", "Thanks. Actually, my question was just asked. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Julianna Balicka. Your line is open.", "Julianna Balicka", "Hi, Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Good afternoon.", "Julianna Balicka", "I have a couple of questions. One, just to kind of go back and follow up on the buyout and the asset-based nonperforming credits that you expect to stay nonperformers for several quarters - at the end, when you resolve them, is this going to be a binary outcome of either a large charge-off or a large reverse - reserve release? Or, as the turnaround of these companies that you're cautiously optimistic about, happens each quarter, are you going to give them some incremental credit, and we might see incremental reserve releases?", "Marc Cadieux", "So this is Marc Cadieux. Yeah, the answer is it\u2019s hard to predict how these things play out. Having said that both of these borrowers are substantial businesses and so the likelihood of a total charge-off devolving into liquidation, that kind of scenario I think is a much lower probability of that.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay, very good. And then - but, I mean, just in terms of the - if we go with the positive outcome, then you will be releasing these reserves. Is this something you would do incredibly each quarter, or is this something you'll wait until the very end?", "Marc Cadieux", "It will depend on the nature of how it\u2019s getting better. Yeah, for example an acquisition of the company that results in repayment would result in the fairly immediate release of reserve, a gradual turnaround and one that we become increasingly confident and that has momentum would be the more gradual kind.", "Julianna Balicka", "Okay. I see. And then maybe if I can switch topics, please back to the payments revenue that you were just discussing. In terms of - some of your - the fintech third party clients that are your clients, and you grew up with them, and you provide payments for them, are you now also going out there competing and winning business for fintech companies that may not have been processing through you because when they were started two or three years ago, you did not have the product capabilities? And so, now, have you won any new big clients recently?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg again and the answer is yes. Obviously our capabilities and our ability to support to these companies has improved significantly over the last 12 to 24 months and we\u2019re looking at companies that may not have done their processing with us for a variety of different reasons and gone back. And yes, we\u2019ve won some very nice larger companies on the kind of being their payment backbone. So it\u2019s a combination of both growing with our clients as well as going in the market and selling our value proposition to these companies and we feel very good about both.", "Julianna Balicka", "Very good and if I can ask one more and I'll step back. In terms of the private bank, where you've seen some nice growth, just kind of top-down view in terms of your portfolio mix, what share of your loan portfolio distribution would you like to see the private bank get to? Or, I mean, what is kind of like the macro vision there?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg, I\u2019ll start and Marc may want to add to it. We look at portfolios in a lot of different ways. We look at concentration limits and from that standpoint I\u2019ll start with the good news. The good news about the mortgage portfolio is we expect to have a very positive credit results when we think about that. And so really from a mixed perspective, they\u2019re being [ph] very comfortable from a credit perspective, but you still need mix limitations. You\u2019re looking at portfolios - in the short term I actually don\u2019t see in the next 12 to 24 months really a limiter on our ability to grow that business, kind of at the current pace that it\u2019s at is going to be fine. So you really want it to deal with what I\u2019ll call a concentration question until you\u2019re looking at hitting 20%, 30% or more - 35% of the portfolio, but that\u2019s several years out.", "Julianna Balicka", "Very good, thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Absolutely.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Greg Becker for final remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Great, thanks everyone for joining us today. We\u2019re pleased with our second quarter and excited about the opportunities we have in 2015 and beyond. And as we talked about both, where we are in the cycle - place in the innovation economy and the outlook feel really good about the strategy and where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re going to continue to execute in what I would describe it as a very disciplined way to strengthen our position and be the partner in choice for these innovation companies. It\u2019s critical to us, we just want to thank our clients. It\u2019s the most important thing and we appreciate they\u2019re putting their trust in us and our employees for making - allowing this to happen. So with that I want to thank everyone for being here and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Meghan O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Miesha [ph], and thanks everyone for joining us today.", "Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our third quarter 2015 results. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion today may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thanks everyone for joining us today.", "We had a solid third quarter, delivering earnings per share of $1.57 and net income of $81.7 million. Our core earnings engine remained strong and we are seeing healthy activity across all client groups.", "Highlights of the third quarter included healthy average loan growth of $596 million or 4.2%, strong average client funds growth of $6.5 billion or 9%, solid core fee income growth of 3.5%, and stable credit quality overall. And although the exit markets were tempered, especially IPOs, we had very healthy net gains at $23.4 million on warrants and investment securities net of controlling interest.", "Our results reflect continued positive conditions for our innovation clients, despite certain broader market issues that have emerged in the last few months, market volatility has increased, there is concern about Chinese growth rate, and the Fed's direction on interest rates is uncertain. In spite of these issues, our clients are doing well and we see plenty of opportunity for growth and expansion ahead.", "Given that we are approaching the end of the year, I'm going to focus primarily on 2016, our priorities, a preview of financial expectations, and our view on the implications of some of the market dynamics we're seeing. We have three key priorities for 2016, each of which continues to -- continues or accelerates an initiative we currently have in place designed to maintain our leadership in the innovation space.", "First, continuing to enhance our strong brand and reputation. This means ongoing improvement of our client experience through investment in our digital platform. We need to operate the way our clients do and continue to make it easy to work with us. It also means differentiating ourselves even more through our products and services, but mainly through the value-add of knowledge networks that SVB can uniquely provide.", "Second, continuing to invest in our business for the long-term growth. This means developing our existing team and hiring expertise when we need it, so we can have the right team in place to focus on delivering better-than-peer growth. Also means ensuring we have the systems, solutions and infrastructure to support that growth in a scalable way.", "Third, maintaining our strong risk management. This means ensuring credit remained stable and healthy overall, even if we do experience a slowdown. It also means continuing to enhance and invest in risk management and compliance to meet increasing regulatory requirements, especially as we approach $50 billion of assets. We are confident in our ability to deliver on these priorities in 2016, in part because we have been focusing on investing in them for some time and are making good progress.", "Now let's look at our preliminary outlook for 2016. And please keep this in mind. In a departure from our usual practice, we are not basing this outlook on the latest forward curve. Given the unusual level of uncertainty over whether the rate increases will actually materialize in 2016, we believe that it's prudent at this time to assume no market interest rate increases between now and the end of 2016. Despite this assumption on our part, we expect solid performance.", "First, average loan growth in the low double digits. That would put us in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion growth rate that we talked about as reasonable from an annual pace perspective given our emphasis on smart growth and a competitive low rate environment.", "Second, average deposit growth in the low double digits. This assumes continued robust new client acquisition and reasonably healthy funding trends for our clients with continued success in our off-balance sheet initiatives.", "Third, net interest income growth in the low double digits. If rates did rise consistent with the forward curve, it would increase our net interest income outlook significantly to the low 20% range.", "Fourth, stable credit quality overall. Specifically, we expect full year net charge-offs between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans, consistent with our expectations for 2015. Our fifth metric is core fee income, which we expect to grow in the mid-teens. This would largely be driven by foreign exchange, credit cards and payments. And if rates did rise consistent with the forward curve, that would increase our core fee income growth outlook to the low 20% range due to higher income from our client investment funds.", "And finally, non-interest expense growth net of NCI in the high single digits. And this includes the impact of the investments I mentioned in our priorities.", "Clearly we're expecting good things in 2016 even without help from interest rates and assuming no significant deterioration of the U.S. or global economies in our markets.", "Now let's talk about the backdrop. Although we are positive about 2016, there are a few areas we're watching closely. These include valuations, VC investment levels, and exits. Our view has been consistent. There's frothiness in the markets to be sure, but we do not believe we are in a bubble. So what do we think is happening?", "First, the best companies are getting more attention. They're raising larger rounds of equity and are staying private longer. This, more than anything, is what's behind the higher valuations, and one of the reasons VC investment is at such high levels, because they've been able to access healthy equity funding, these highly valued companies general have low leverage. In addition, many of them have significant customer and revenue traction, and many are disrupting industries and creating significant new market opportunities. Of course, some companies will prove to be overvalued and some will fail. Others will grow into their valuations over time, even if they're somewhat ahead of themselves at the moment. And some will become breakout companies.", "Second, despite solid overall new company formation, backed by a growing group of sources for startup capital, there are signs that fewer venture capital rounds are being raised. Although we haven't seen a trend yet, at some point, companies with more challenging business models, less differentiation or poor traction will have more difficulty raising funds. This is more likely given some of the market pullback we've seen. But let's be clear, this is the venture capital innovation model: truly innovative companies and early movers will succeed while others will fail.", "Third, we're watching exits. IPO slowed significantly in the third quarter. It's too early to say whether this is the beginning of a longer IPO pullback, but volatility in the markets may be a reason for companies to stay private longer.", "So we're paying attention to these potential issues and we do not see them having a material impact at this point.", "And on that note, we clearly get a lot of questions about the health of the venture industry and what impact we might see, and I want to underscore 'might,' if there are meaningful disruption in VC activity. If a meaningful disruption were to occur, it could result in deleveraging by our clients, lower VC investment in warrant gains, and possibly unrealized losses, and higher loan losses in our early-stage loan portfolio, although it's very important to note that early-stage loans constitute a relatively small part of our loan portfolio at less than 10% of total loans. Our experience suggests these negative impacts will be short-lived if they occurred, as the innovation economy has repeatedly proven to be more resilient and has shown higher growth over time than the broader economy.", "In closing, we are pleased with the third quarter results and the momentum going into the fourth quarter. Moreover, we expect a solid performance in 2016 even without rate increases, while we are keeping our eye on the markets and paying close attention as always to credit. We feel we have good insight into the health of our industries and the advantage of working with the best companies and investors in them. The innovation space has grown and changed significantly in the last three decades, but its resilience and dynamic nature had persisted through all markets. We continue to view the global innovation space as the best possible place to be for the long term.", "Thank you. And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg, and good afternoon everyone.", "We had a solid quarter marked by healthy balance sheet growth, strong core fee income, and stable credit quality overall. I would like to highlight a few items in my comments today, which I will cover in more detail shortly.", "First, healthy loan growth. Second, substantial growth in total client funds. Third, higher net interest income despite a lower net interest margin. Fourth, credit quality, which was in line with our expectations. Fifth, higher core fee income with continuing momentum in foreign exchange and credit cards and payments. And finally, lower expenses due primarily to lower incentive compensation.", "Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $596 million or 4.2% to $14.9 billion. This growth was driven primarily by private equity capital call loans, although we saw growth across most client segments. Period-end loans grew by $1.1 billion to $15.3 billion, primarily due to growth in private equity capital call loans. Although we continue to see ample opportunity to lend, we remain focused on high quality, smart loan growth, with appropriate pricing, size and structure relative to our risk and cost of capital. In this low rate and competitive environment, they have all been pressured.", "Due to a moderately better than expected pace of loan growth year to date, we are raising our full year 2015 outlook from the mid-20s to the high-20s, although we expect to be near the low end of that range.", "Now let us move to total client funds, that is combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. Average total client funds grew by $6.5 billion or 9% to $79.4 billion, and period-end total client funds grew by $4.9 billion or 6.5% to just above $80 billion for the first time in our history. This growth was due to continued funding for our venture-backed clients, healthy inflows from our private equity and venture capital clients, and continued new client acquisition.", "Average off-balance sheet client investment fund balances grew by $4.1 billion or 11% to $42 billion and accounted for 63% of total average client funds growth in the quarter. Period-end client investment funds grew by $3.5 billion or 8.7% to $43.4 billion and accounted for 71% of period-end total client funds growth.", "Average on-balance sheet deposits grew by $2.4 billion or 7% to $37.4 billion, while period-end deposits grew by $1.4 billion or 4% to $37 billion. We are maintaining our full year 2015 deposit outlook of growth in the high 20s and expect to finish the year near the low end of that range.", "Turning to net interest income and the net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $10.8 million or 4.4% to $255 million in the third quarter. This increase was due primarily to higher loan and investment securities balances. Higher average loan balances, plus one additional beta [ph] in the quarter, contributed $7.7 million in interest income. Although loan yields decreased by 3 basis points due to loan mix and lower prepayment fees.", "Average fixed income securities balances increased by $1.5 billion or 7% to $23 billion due to strong deposit growth, although yields on the portfolio decreased by 6 basis points to 1.54%. Yields were affected by a $1.8 million increase in premium amortization expense related to increased prepayments on mortgage-backed securities due to lower market rates.", "New purchases of $2.2 billion during the quarter consisted of U.S. treasury and Ginnie Mae securities, with an average blended yield of 1.5%. Portfolio duration remained stable at 2.7 years, compared to 2.8 years in the second quarter.", "Our net interest margin decreased by 8 basis points to 2.5%, primarily due to strong deposit growth, as well as lower loan and investment yields. For the full year 2015, we expect our net interest income to be at the low end of our outlook of the high teens and net interest margin to be at the high end of our range of 2.4% to 2.6%.", "Looking forward, if our investment balances continued to be bolstered by strong deposit flows and rates remain low, all things being equal, we would expect continued pressure on our net interest margin. If rates rise, that would certainly help our net interest margin and net interest income.", "Now let us move to credit quality. Our credit quality remained stable overall and generally within our expectations. Here are the highlights. Net charge-offs of $28.5 million, primarily due to one loan for which we had previously recorded significant reserves, an increase in non-performing loans due primarily to two newly-impaired loans, although non-performing loans are still low at $115 million or 75 basis points of total gross loans, and a higher provision due to period-end loan growth and specific reserves related to the additions to non-performing loans.", "Now, the details. Provision for loan losses was $33.4 million, compared to $26.5 million in the second quarter. This figure reflects $10.4 million related to loan growth, $20.1 million in specific reserves for newly-impaired loans, and $4.6 million related to charge-offs not previously reserved for.", "Net charge-offs were $28.5 million, reflecting gross charge-offs of $29.1 million, primarily related to one loan of $21.7 million partially impaired in the fourth quarter of 2014, for which we had prior reserves of $17.9 million. To keep things in perspective, year-to-date net charge-offs were 31 basis points, compared to 39 basis points for the same period in 2014.", "Non-performing loans increased by $14.7 million to $115.5 million, primarily due to the addition of two sponsored buyout loans totaling $41.3 million. This addition was partially offset by the $21.7 million charge-off previously mentioned.", "Overall our loan portfolio is performing within what we consider normal ranges. We saw no material change in criticized balances during the quarter, and to date, we are not seeing a discernible impact from recent market volatility.", "Non-performing loans also remained well within normal ranges. As we indicated last quarter, we expect non-performing loans to remain at their current levels for several quarters given the nature of sponsored buyout lending.", "We expect net charge-offs as a percentage of total gross loans to be at the low end of our full year 2015 outlook range of 30 to 50 basis points, and we are reaffirming our full year outlook for all other credit metrics.", "Now let us move non-interest income. I will refer to several non-GAAP measures in my discussion, and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details.", "GAAP non-interest income was $108.5 million in the third quarter, compared to $126.3 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interest was $102.1 million, compared to $117.7 million in the second quarter. The primary differences between third quarter and second quarter non-GAAP non-interest income were lower gains on warrants and lower, though still healthy, PE and VC related investment securities gains, offset somewhat by higher core fee income.", "We had warrant gains of $10.7 million, compared to $23.6 million in the second quarter, driven primarily by valuation updates and, to a lesser extent, by M&A activity. It is important to point out that warrant gains in the second quarter were elevated due to the $13.9 million gain from the Fitbit [ph] IPO. Further contributing to the decline is that there were very few IPOs in the third quarter, and as a result, no notable gains on exercises.", "We have private equity and venture capital related investment gains net of non-controlling interest of $12.7 million, compared to $15.9 million in the second quarter. This included $7.2 million of realized gains from distributions in our strategic and other investments portfolio, and $6 million of gains from our managed funds of funds.", "Turning to core fee income. Core fee income increased by 3.5% or $2.3 million to $68.4 million in the third quarter, primarily due to continued strength in foreign exchange and credit card fees. This represents a 28% increase in core fee income over the same period last year. As a reminder, core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letter of credit, deposit service charges, lending related fees, and client investment fees.", "As a result of continued strength in our core fee lines, we are increasing our full year 2015 outlook for growth in the low 20s to the mid 20s and expect to end the year in the middle of that range.", "Moving on to expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $9.4 million or 4.8% to $184.8 million. This decrease was driven primarily by lower incentive compensation expense primarily related to a slight change in our full year earnings outlook, coupled with elevated levels of incentive compensation in the second quarter. Specifically, the decline was related to or incentive program based on our relative ROE performance against peer performance.", "We are reaffirming our 2015 full year outlook for expense growth in the low double digits. The key variables that could drive expenses higher than our expectations are loan growth, which affects our loan loss provision, and ultimately incentive compensation expense, and warrant and [ph] investment securities gains which also affect incentive compensation. If we outperform on any of these categories, it could lead to higher-than-expected expense growth for the quarter and the year overall.", "In closing, we delivered a solid performance in the third quarter and are on track to meet our 2015 outlook. As we expected, loan growth during the quarter returned to more typical levels and credit quality remained stable overall, despite the modest increase in non-performing loans. Although we are paying close attention to our loan pipeline and portfolio in light of recent volatility in the stock market, as well as concerns over momentum in the global markets, we see solid momentum in loans and fee income and are not seeing anything significant that would change our outlook on credit quality at this point.", "Competition and the availability of low-cost capital in the markets remain challenges to growth in yield and require us to be discerning about the opportunities we pursue. That said, there are plenty of opportunities, as our preliminary outlook for 2016 suggests. We remain focused on delivering high-quality growth today that will continue to position us well for the long term.", "Thank you. And now I would like to ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "Our first question is from Joe Morford with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Thank you. Good afternoon everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Greg, you touched on this I guess a little bit, but obviously with the chatter about the lack of new tech IPOs and the poor performance of those that have made it out, how important is it -- is that for your average client? And at this point, does it really matter if these unicorns of billion-dollar valuations can't go public today at these levels? Have they raised enough money in the private market to support the businesses for quite a while?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Joe, it's Greg. When I think about impact of these more substantial companies, there's a couple of things. One is, if companies can't go out and go public, and this is broadly speaking, there's no IPOs that could impact our securities gains, warrant gains in some way, as I alluded to. When you think about the rest of the business, if these companies stay private longer, that's not necessarily a bad thing. They have a lot of liquidity, whether they're public or private, they have a lot of liquidity. And so, quite honestly, very few of them borrow money. So there isn't that big of an impact. And as I said in my comments, again, very few of them have these larger companies have a lot of debt. So from a risk perspective, they also don't present many challenges.", "So the short story is then directly, I'd say no. The question is, what happens to the rest of the industry, right, if there's more challenges with some of these larger companies. And that could have a ripple effect. I think it's manageable, and the question would be, if that were to happen, how severe could it be? I think right now we feel would definitely be manageable.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. And then the other question is, obviously, the charge-offs this quarter were over and beyond the 2015 and preliminary 2016 full year guidance, so -- in terms of the percentage rate. So I guess, what gives you the comfort that we're still dealing with more one-off or company-specific issues as opposed to something more systemic?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Joe, I'll start, and Marc Cadieux can certainly chime in here.", "I think maybe just to step back a little bit, because when we talk about the net charge-offs, net charge-offs year to date around 31 basis points, and so it's still within our guidance of the 30 to 50 basis points for the full year. And as we said in our comments, our prepared remarks, we still expect it to come in between that 30 and 50. So I wouldn't say it was any change in our expectation with respect to net charge-offs.", "Joe Morford - RBC Capital Markets", "Okay. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is Jared Shaw with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, good evening. How are you?", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Jared.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Just sticking with the theme on the OSH [ph] financings and I guess timing of the VC, PE utilization. Some of the data that we've been seeing, it seems like the pace of private capital deployment in the industry certainly seems like it peaked in third quarter, is falling so far in the fourth quarter. Are you seeing that sort of trend as we're entering the fourth quarter now or do you expect to see the VC, PE capital call line stay at similar levels into the fourth quarter?", "Greg Becker", "So there's a couple of questions there, one is just the overall funding, and then it relates to outstandings on PE and VC. So I'll start, this is Greg, and then Marc would add on the utilization levels on PE, VC capital call facilities.", "We did see a drop in the number of financings in the third quarter, although the dollars were still exceptionally strong. And it goes back to what I said in my comments, money is really being more highly allocated towards the higher-profile companies, which makes sense. Again, a few of them are going public. There's still -- they're growing revenue and they're able to raise capital. So they're just taking private longer.", "One of the things we're looking at is the number of companies that are being invested in, and that is a slowdown. We are not seeing that impact our portfolio yet, either from a credit perspective or, clearly as you saw in the third quarter, from a total client funds perspective, which was incredibly strong. So we're just not seeing it yet. And again as I mentioned in my comments, we can see a slowdown clearly, but we don't expect anything what I'll call dramatic.", "Let me turn it over to Marc to talk about utilization and the capital call lines of credit for VC and PE than.", "Marc Cadieux", "And so picking up there -- it's Marc -- utilization of these credit facilities was up in the third quarter, and yeah, it remains to be seen whether that will continue into the fourth quarter, though as we've seen in prior years, there can be some seasonality to the third quarter as well as the fourth quarter. Said another way, yeah, oftentimes there is a little bit of slowdown in the third quarter and it picked up in the fourth quarter. Will we see that this year, is unclear. But that is the point I would add.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. We'd expect to see some of that at the end of the year. The question is the magnitude. As you know, last year we had a significant run-up at the end of the year. We're not predicting that to happen to that level, but we expect to see some of it.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "And then, as you sort of gauge the temperature in Silicon Valley there with -- if IPOs did slow down and companies stayed private longer and held on to their VC funding longer, do you see that as primarily driving slower levels of future VC funding or that it would attract more money to the VC market and you could see actually that market expand for the private fundings?", "Greg Becker", "You know, predicting the venture capital market is a difficult task. If somebody would have said this year we'd end up at the levels we are, I would have been wrong in my prediction. When I look out at the 2016, for me, I'd say more of a stable number is probably what I would look at. I'm hard-pressed to see it grow from where it is right now, even though you're going to see I think more companies stay private longer.", "Other things that come into play though, you were talking about the IPO market, just to clarify, that the M&A market was still robust. And quite honestly, we expect that to continue. You've heard some of these big announcements of mergers together, and while I don't think that will create a trend, I do think it helps, and I think more companies maybe look at these companies to say, we need to acquire them, we need to merge with them, to create a more critical mass. I expect that market to maintain or continue to be robust into 2016.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thanks. And then on the incentive comp, it seems there's like maybe a little bit of a disconnect with what we've seen in terms of loan growth and what the accrual was last quarter, that we've seen in the third quarter. So, most of that is due to the -- could you just go through again what the change in incentive comp was given the strong growth we saw in lending this quarter?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Sure, Jared. This is Mike. Somewhat of a two-fold explanation. One, incentive compensation increased significantly in Q2, as you probably saw. Now in Q3, the mechanism we were referring to in the prepared remarks, it relates to our incentive program related to ROE performance, our ROE performance compared to our peers. And it's based on a ranking mechanism.", "And so it doesn't take a whole lot of movement in the ranking to move it up or down, and in fact we're having this quarter, with a slight change in our view for the full year ROE, our ranking amongst our peers slipped just ever so slightly, and what happens is you have this kind of a catch-up factor from Q1 and Q2, which also makes for some larger swings and some [ph] incentive compensation. But it does get back to kind of the pay-for-performance model and shows that ROE is very important for us.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is Ken Zerbe with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you very much. Good evening guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Ken.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "A question for Mike actually. So you guys have talked about the loan growth guidance, call it roughly $1.5 billion to $2 billion going forward from here annually. And I know a lot of that seems to be based on the ROE model by putting on business that actually meets your ROE hurdles. Could you just help us understand? Because you, like I said, you've been talking about it for a couple of quarters, but at the same time, Fed funds futures over the last several quarters has really come down a lot. How much is your ROE estimates based on interest rates? And does the forward curve actually change or could it lead to changes in your loan growth guidance? Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "So, Ken, this is Greg. Let me -- I'm going to start with it and then Mike can add.", "I -- when we think about, we call it smart growth, our way of looking at it from ROE perspective, we're looking at the return we're going to get, quite honestly, without a lot of impact for interest rates. So when you look out -- and again a lot of these credit facilities, as you know, are shorter-term in nature, so it'll be a little bit different maybe if you were looking at a longer, you know, long end of the curve, but obviously we're looking at what prime is going to be doing, Fed funds rate, LIBOR, etcetera. And so that hasn't changed a lot. So the fact that the short-term, medium-term has come down, quite honestly, really doesn't have a lot of an impact on the number that we gave.", "Again one of the things that could change, right, and we talked about upside, we could say, see in 2016 some upside from private equity or private bank, as Mike articulated, and that's one area. But we're still comfortable even with the change in rate outlook with the $1.5 billion to $2 billion.", "Mike Descheneaux", "And I would just add that, when we came out and talked about the warrant up to $2 billion in Q1, that was contemplated given the backup of the low rate environment and the competitive rate environment. So, hence, that was one of the reasons why we came down and kind of booked in those ranges there.", "Marc Cadieux", "And it's Marc. I'll add one more thing, lest we focus entirely on the ROE and the economics of it. Smart growth is also about credit structure and deal size. But in the increasingly competitive environment we've been in, that is another thing that we think about every day, that we're looking at opportunities as to whether its price size and structure are within our parameters.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. Understood. Okay. And then I generally get the concept of why that could actually be higher if competition eases, but given how competitive the market is today, do you view the $1.5 billion to $2 billion really as a floor, or is there anything that is possible that could really drive that growth even slower than that?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I mean, yeah, I mean there's clearly things that could happen. I mean you could have a market downturn the way I described it, and we don't expect that to happen. But if you did see a dramatic change in the economy, if you did see a dramatic change in venture capital activity and companies couldn't get funded, you could see a slowdown. As I said, deleveraging is one of those things that could happen again, because technology companies tend to have more liquidity, right? So that could happen. But as we are, you know, given perspective on our views for 2016, we don't expect that to happen. We're comfortable with that $1.5 billion to $2 billion level.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Julianna Balicka with K.B.W. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Afternoon.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "So I have a couple of questions. One, in terms of your outlook for next year, you are reducing your core fee income growth to the mid-teens from your current run rate which you just increased to the mid-20s. And given the fact that you've been taking market share gains and expanding these businesses, why are you reducing your year-over-year growth expectations this much?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Julianna, this is Greg. I'll start.", "When you look at the numbers, the key growth is coming from, again, FX, we believe, and credit cards, are the two drivers. And we've seen substantial growth in those areas, and the teams have done an excellent job. That being said, you do have a little bit of large numbers coming in to play. And I would argue, when you look at kind of a mid-teens level, that that is still extremely strong growth when you look at the base that we actually have right now.", "So, could there be upside? You know, yeah. But I'd say right now, again, our perspective as we look out into 2016 is we're comfortable in that mid-teens range.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Got it. Okay. And then when I look at your average deposit growth in the low double digits, and just kind of trying to do some basic arithmetic around -- so your -- for your deposit growth for the year already into the high-20s implies some $44 billion of average deposits next quarter, to just make the math work, and then for that -- for then -- then to make the math work for 2016 for your average deposits to grow in the low double digits, are we looking at declining deposits? I mean it just -- it doesn't tie up arithmetically?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, this is Mike. I'm not quite sure what the math is, perhaps we can maybe take it offline and I can kind of walk you through. But certainly, as Greg said in his remarks and my remarks, we are seeing continued growth of funds, so I don't -- we don't necessarily see a contraction. Obviously they could happen, but again given the nature of the last several quarters and years, it just -- you tend not to see that. But perhaps I can help you offline.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Okay, very --", "Greg Becker", "And then let me just -- I'll add to it. When you think about the growth we've had this year and the level of venture capital activity being as high as it has been, my comments for venture capital activity would be kind of a stable to maybe even a slight decline from where we are right now, given how strong it has been, and a little bit of the turmoil in the market or uncertainty. And if that were to happen, clearly you could end up seeing the growth rate of deposits slow down. Remember though, we're still driving towards more than half of the deposit balances for the client funds moving off-balance sheet, and we would expect that to continue.", "So, still expect it to grow, and feel good about the outlook, but it will be tempered compared to where it was in 2015.", "Julianna Balicka - K.B.W.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Alexopoulos with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hey everybody. I wanted to start on --", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Steve.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hi. I wanted to start on credit. [Is this the three] sponsor-led buyout loans that have been impaired over the past two quarters?", "Marc Cadieux", "It's Marc. And yes, that is the statistic.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay.", "Marc Cadieux", "Having said that, I think it's important to step back and just -- to give that three in two quarters some context. We've been in the buyout lending business for nine years now, the currently portfolio is 130 loans, of which three, to your point, are now in our non-performing. And so, yeah, hopefully that helps.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Go ahead, Greg.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, let me just add on to it. So when you look at that, it is 3 out of 130. And as we said when we've been on road shows with you and other people and talked on the call, clearly there's going to be a period of time when you have these companies that have issues and challenges and again can, you know, our goal is that we're working with the right sponsors to help turn these companies around, which we certainly believe they will, and will occur.", "You know, I would say, focus on the outlook that we have given for 2016 as a kind of point of view for our expectations on what may happen. Bottom line is we don't expect it to happen. We clearly looked at the portfolio. It doesn't it can't or won't. But we're comfortable with where we are right now, and again in context, it's 3 out of 130.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Right. Maybe to follow up on that though, are these three related? It just seems unusual to go nine years and have none of these become impaired and then have three in two quarters.", "Greg Becker", "Sure. So I would first say that, yeah, there's a portfolio seasoning aspect to this that, as we've made more loans and they've been on the books for larger period of time, inevitably you're going to have a couple of that turn out this way.", "Having said that, there really is little that these companies have in common. The two from the current quarter are from our life science segment. They both sell to hospitals. That's really where the similarities end. I would liken these to sort of individual circumstances, company-specific issues with all three of them, which by extension is not indicative of any systemic issue or emerging trend that we can see at this time in the portfolio segment.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "That's helpful. Maybe to shift gears for a minute. Greg, to follow up on your comments that you're seeing maybe less potential VC funding, are you guys already seeing startups adjust cash burn? And what's your expected impact on deposits from that, if it's happening?", "Greg Becker", "You know, Steve, it's Greg, the -- it's being talked about. Have we really seen it a whole lot? The answer is no.", "Yeah, I'd just say we just haven't seen it yet. Do I expect it to occur? Yes. I do expect that companies are going to be more disciplined as they go into 2016. And we've seen this before where there becomes noise in the market about different people talking about high burn rates and giving advice to their portfolio companies to be disciplined, and it takes a quarter or two or three quarters for them to realize that and start incorporating it in their plans.", "So, do I think it's going to happen in 2016? Yeah. I think that'll happen. But as of yet, we haven't seen it.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. And then you mentioned that you were seeing reductions in valuations, right, rounds [ph]. I'm just curious, how widespread is that? Is that really contained to the larger, more public ones that we read about? I mean you guys are arguably one of the best light sign [ph] into what's going on there, right? Is it just widespread?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. Just to be clear, the amount of venture capital is, you know, was very strong in this quarter. When you look at the number of rounds being raised, that was lower, and that was especially true at the seed and early stage. And so a lot of the money, as I mentioned, where the companies that had been around a little bit and are getting traction and more people are putting bigger chunks of money behind them. So when I think about the level of the series A or seed round, again it's slow.", "Do I expect that to continue? My point of view, my crystal ball would say it's going to probably stay at about this level and we'll probably see again slower than what we saw for a good part of 2015. But I think the level of rounds, the number of rounds for seeding early in third quarter is probably going to be more consistent to what we're going to see fourth quarter, in the first quarter and to 2016.", "Steve Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Okay. Thanks for all the color.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Pancari with Evercore. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "A question on credit again, kind of related to Steve's line of questioning. And so if these credits are unrelated and non-systemic as well, why should non-performers remain high? Is it just because the cure [ph] rate is lower on these types of credits, or do you -- could give us more color there?", "Marc Cadieux", "Yeah. So I think it's maybe best -- it's Marc again -- best to start with the historical perspective on SPV where generally speaking our non-performing loans have by and large been early-stage loans that tend to resolve themselves more quickly. With these larger loans and, by extension, larger companies, they take longer to turn around. And it's that, yes, several quarters or sometimes a year or more to make that turnaround happen and give us the confidence that it's being sustained that results in this being stuck in that category for longer periods of time.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. And then also related to that, there's a seasoning aspect as you indicated, is it fair to assume then that there's more on the way as the portfolio continues to season? Because you grew that book pretty -- at a pretty rapid clip over the past couple of years.", "Marc Cadieux", "So while we did have rapid growth that really has slowed over the last seven [ph] quarters, and I think that is a function of the discipline that we've maintained in terms of loan structure leverage levels, etcetera, and that's the first point. I think that the portfolio we have today is positioned pretty well.", "The second point I would make is, you know, I think as Greg already mentioned, we took another hard look at the portfolio looking for exactly the kind of issues and trends that you might expect we would have looked for. And at present, don't see any indication that we're going to see more at least in the immediate future.", "Greg Becker", "And then just to add on to it, eventually we're going to have more of them [ph], but obviously our plan and expectation is that some of the ones that are on non-performing right now will roll off. Others may be added, but we still expect to be in a comfortable range of NPLs, and as you know, our guidance right now is kind of that 50 to 100 basis points. And we're still comfortable with that and we'd expect to be comfortable with that through cycles.", "Now, again, maybe at some point may inch up above that, we don't expect to see that right now, that's our crystal ball, based on again Marc's review and our team's review of the portfolio. But that's kind of just this -- the structure of this type of loans.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "And if I could just ask one more on credit, a quick one. You indicated that the criticized loans levels remained relatively stable. What is the level? What is that percentage?", "Marc Cadieux", "Five-point-seven percent -- sorry, 5.6% of gross loans.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. Do you have what that was a year ago?", "Marc Cadieux", "A year ago, I don't -- last quarter it was 6.1, so it came down quarter over quarter.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Next question is Jennifer Demba with SunTrust. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Could you talk about your expectations for growth in the international market in 2016 and what you're seeing out there in terms of demand?", "Greg Becker", "Yup. Jennifer, this is Greg. I'll start.", "When we look at, you know, I've bucketed our global stuff in two -- I guess three categories. One is what we're doing in kind of the U.K. and Europe, and I would include Israel in that set as well. And then I would also look at -- and look at Asia in two ways. One is what's happening in our joint venture, and the second one, what's happening in Asia for SPV.", "So what we look at is in the U.K. and Europe, we've seen very good growth. We expect to continue to see very good growth in that category in the kind of 30% plus range, and that is just because there's still a big market opportunity, we still have low market share, and we feel good about the outlook there.", "When you look at the other part, right, it's more deposits less loans. So we have some capital call lending to private equity firms in Asia, which is a few hundred million dollars. And that will grow, but it's still going to be small.", "And then you look at the next category which is the joint venture, in the joint venture, again it's -- we treat it as an equity method as opposed to a consolidation in our balance sheet. So we don't expect to see really much change in that number on an equity basis during the course of 2016. We're in the middle of, as we've talked about, we got our RMB license, we're building that out, and we feel good about that, but as we've said and we'll continue to say for a while, that's a long-term growth proposition. It won't contribute truly for a number of years, although we do benefit from that from cross-border activity that comes from those introductions and from those relationships that are being built in the joint venture.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Brett Rabatin with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Good afternoon.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Wanted to just ask, I know I've asked this a year or two ago, but just thinking about the profitability, you guys have currently and maybe your growth is slower, you have almost 40% of your earning assets and pretty low-yielding securities and cash. Would at least some modest level of a barbell strategy eventually become appropriate with the outlook for interest rates continuing to push out further lower for longer, so to speak?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Well, I wish we knew exactly what was going to happen so you could make definitive judgments on where to invest. But having said that, we all know that's not going to happen.", "So, one of the things we're always very, very conscientious is the size of our investment securities portfolio. And so when you have a size of the portfolio as we do, approximately say 55% to 56%, plus or minus, in that range, you really got to be very focused on liquidity in the shorter-term duration. So that's what our philosophy has been for the last several years and it's served us very well and will likely continue to maintain and keep that shorter-duration security and managing that duration extension risk until we get more clarity on where rates are going to go.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "And I guess a follow-up question on that is, when rates do rise, what are you assuming happens to the on-balance-sheet deposits and what actions might you take with off-balance-sheet to mitigate that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "That's a very difficult question to answer. I mean it's very difficult to understand how our clients will be thinking about what will happen when rates do go up, because nobody has been around these last few years to even understand what an interest rate is. So the behavior is a little bit uncertain.", "Again, having said, you have to be prepared for that, if there is pressure or migration to go off, that you have to maintain a very liquid securities portfolio, which we are doing. So we are well-prepared for several billion dollars if it does need to move off. Again, if we don't want it to move off, we can certainly afford to pay up to keep it on if necessary, because in that sense, if deposits are being pressured to go off, that means you're probably in a high interest rate environment which you're making more money on net interest income that you can afford to pay off. So it's a bit of a complicated question, but the short answer is we're prepared for, if there is pressure, to be able to handle that if necessary.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. Great. Thanks for the color, Mike.", "Operator", "Our next question is Tyler Stafford with Stephens. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon guys. Just to follow up on Jenny's question earlier. Do you have the global loan and deposit balances as of 3Q?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg. The deposit balances, you know, again roughly haven't changed a whole lot. They're about kind of $6-1/2 billion when you look at it, and this is mainly deposits -- a little bit off-balance-sheet, but it's almost all deposits. And lending side, you can look at it and you're roughly around, again, roughly around $1.1 billion. And again it's grown a little bit, but again part of the fluctuation up and down ends up being some of the capital call loans to private equity firms, and that literally can swing $100 million or $150 million in a month. So -- and that's just because the portfolio hasn't built up enough concentrations so that the, you know, the advances and payoffs offset each other enough to create more of a standard growth rate.", "But again that's kind of what we're building from. But we feel really good about where we are and that -- and the opportunities ahead. And as I said before, we still expect that's going to be at a growth pace much higher than what we see with the rest of the portfolio.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then your bank level leverage ratios, a little over 7% now. Just curious as your current thoughts on capital and then what's the cash at the holding company as of 3Q?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah. So we continue to watch that tier 1 leverage ratio very closely, at the bank level and the holding company level. And as you pointed out, it is lower this quarter because of deposit growth. It's still within our acceptable ranges. As you've heard us say before, we're fine between 7% and 8%. And there's certainly certain things we can do to continue to shore that up. And the answer to your question about cash at the holding company level, because you're implying that we could downstream some of that to help the ratio at the bank level, we probably have somewhere around $365 million or so currently at the holding company level.", "Now, naturally you wouldn't downstream all of that to help it out, but certainly you could downstream some of that to help out if necessary. But again, right now it's still within our ranges.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay, thanks. And then one more, if I could sneak it in. Of the off-balance-sheet client fund growth this quarter, how much of that came from new client adds versus existing clients moving to the off-balance sheet products, roughly?", "Mike Descheneaux", "I don't have the exact numbers in front of me, but, defining what a new client is, I mean new clients within the quarter or new client within the last six months, it's very difficult to assess that. But I would say generally what we have seen is somewhere between 15% and 20% per quarter is coming from new clients kind of originate in that quarter. But again that's kind of a -- it's a bit difficult to really pin it down to define what truly is a new client. Because when a new client comes onboard, they're not necessarily funded right away and they may be funded a couple of months later.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys, I appreciate it.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And our next question is Aaron Deer with Sandler O'Neill & Partners. Please go ahead, your line is now open.", "AAD:", "I'm good. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks, Aaron.", "Operator", "All right. We have no further questions at this time. I would like to hand it back over to CEO Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today.", "As we talked about, we are -- we feel really good about the third quarter and again the balance of 2015. And as we talk about 2016, although some of the numbers are tempered with deposit growth in a few other areas, the numbers are so strong when you look at it from a guidance on loan growth, outlook in fee income and other areas. So we feel good.", "And the reason we feel good is not just our ability to execute, it's because we are in the right market and have the right team of people and of course have the best clients. And so, feel really good about where we are, despite the kind of turmoil we're all dealing with in the market. And I want to thank all our clients for trusting us and our employees for supporting our clients.", "And so with that, have a great day. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Director of Investor Relations. Meghan O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Adriane, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our fourth quarter and full year 2015 financial results and our 2016 outlook. As usual, they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making some forward-looking statements during this call and I want you to warn you that actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in the call. In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour. Follow on questions are all right but keep them to a minimum. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thanks all of you for joining us today. The fourth quarter of 2015 was a strong finish to a great year. We delivered earnings per share of $1.68 and net income of $88 million marked by healthy activity across the business. A growing balance sheet, strong core fee income and stable credit quality. Mike will go into details of our financial performance in a few minutes.", "For the full year 2015 we delivered earnings per share of $6.62 versus $5.31 in 2014 and we grew net income by 30% to $344 million. These results attest to the ongoing strength of the innovation economy and our ability to execute on our growth strategy despite interest rate, market and competitive challenges. I'm extremely proud of what we accomplished in 2015.", "I'd like to start by giving you some of our year-over-year financial highlights. We grew average loans by 28% to $14.8 billion, exceeding our original guidance of percentage growth in the mid 20s. We grew average total client funds that is deposits plus off balance sheet client investments by 29% to $75.5 billion. We increased net interest income by 18% in line with our guidance and it reached $1 billion in net interest income for the first time in our history. We maintained solid credit quality as we said we would despite higher non-performing loans for the year. And although we exceeded our original expense guidance due to higher incentive compensation, if you back up the amount of incentive compensation related to outperformance our expense growth was in line with our guidance for the year. Finally we delivered a healthy return average equity of 11.18% with almost no help from rates.", "I'm proud of these results but I'm equally proud of how we achieved them through our continued focus on building deep relationships with fast growth innovation companies and our investors, leveraging our platform and expertise to grow our market leadership and maintaining our discipline in underwriting and partnering with the best clients. This focus enabled us to further strengthen our business in 2015 by increasing our share of the best clients, increasing volumes and penetration in our fee based products, continuing our global expansion, expanding our digital delivery and capabilities and benefitting from the dynamic nature of our clients' industries.", "Now I'd like to give you a few examples of the progress we've made in each of these categories during the year. Starting with clients; we grew our net client account by 18% thanks to our dominant position in serving early stage companies and our investors and our success from working with larger companies and PE firms. We maintained a market leadership of early stage companies and added approximately 2,000 net new early stage clients in 2015. 57% of all U.S. VC backed technology companies that went public in 2015, were clients of SVB and 42% of life science IPO companies were SVB clients. On the private bank side we added more than 400 new client households during the year and grew loans by 37%.", "Turning to our global efforts, we continued to make meaningful progress in the execution of our global growth strategy. We grew international loan balances to just over $1.3 billion on a period end basis, with the bulk of this growth in the U.K. where period end loans increased by 48% in 2015. We continued to add clients at a robust pace in our international offices, pulling our total international client account by 33%. Our China joint venture bank achieved a critical long-term milestone in receiving its local currency license. These joint efforts of strong client acquisition and global expansion helped drive higher fee income in 2015. Foreign exchange was particularly strong posting a 21% increase in revenues which reached $87 million in 2015.", "Payments were another bright spot. We saw a significant growth in credit card revenue, which grew by 36% to $57 million. We also continued to make progress in our strategy of providing banking infrastructure services to our in-check and payment related clients. We had a 300% increase in payments processed on our direct transmission platform Transact Gateway and processed more than $21 billion of payments for our clients. Total payment related revenue including credit cards, wires, automated clearing house and merchant services reached $85 million in 2015 a 29% increase over 2014.", "Another area of momentum was in our digital and mobile delivery capabilities, which we enhanced to increase our efficiency and simplified banking for our clients. We saw strong client adoption of our digital offerings with 95% of all new SVB deposit accounts being opened through our digital on boarding platform in 2015. Adoption of our mobile banking app increased as well. We processed $1.5 billion in mobile deposits in 2015 and active users increased to 58% across the bank. We achieved this momentum in 2015 to our ability to focus and execute. At the same time as the banker choice for fast growth innovation companies and our investors, we benefitted from the health of our clients and our markets.", "In 2015 our gains from VC and PE related investments and loans totaled more than $128 million. And although VC exits were down from 2014, which was one of the best year's on recent record venture investments were up and the overall activity remained strong. In summary 2015 was an exceptional year across the board and we finished the year with strong momentum for 2016.", "Now I would like to share how we see things shaping up in 2016. As we look into 2016 we are optimistic about our ability to deliver strong results despite recent market volatility. We expect another year of strong growth in loans and fee income as well as continued solid credit quality. This expectation of course assumes no material change in the business environment for our clients. While volatility and investor uncertainty, present a challenge for the markets overall and the interest rate outlook is still unclear, we believe new company formation, investments and exits among our clients will remain sufficiently healthy to fuel our growth. Even if the pace of those activities is off from its highs in recent years.", "Mike will go into details of our full year 2016 financial outlook in a moment and I am going to steal some of his thunder and tell you that based on our early momentum and our expectations going into this year we are increasing our 2016 guidance for loans, net interest income, net interest margin and core fee income. Our focus in 2016 will remain on the three key initiatives I told you about last quarter.", "First, continuing to enhance our brand and reputation through differentiations, service, added value and our digital client experience. Second, ongoing investment in long-term growth that includes developing and hiring the right talent and ensuring we have the systems, solutions and infrastructure to support scalable growth. And third, continued strong risk management, which includes a focus on stable credit quality and enhancement of our risk management and compliance infrastructure as we grow towards $50 billion.", "We're keeping an eye on valuations, exits in the extreme market volatility we've witnessed so far in 2016. We view recent valuation pullbacks as healthy adjustments with the potential to reduce frothiness in the markets and refocus companies and investors on positive cash flow as a priority.", "In closing, we are optimistic about the year ahead based on the performance we've seen from our clients and their industries and our expectations that we'll continue to execute on our strategy. Our innovation clients continue to drive their business forward regardless of the Unicorn flu that has been going around. Our long experience, relationships and insights into the markets we serve gives us access to many of the best companies and investors and enables us to deliver strong growth without compromising on quality.", "Our unique culture and place in innovation economy enable us to attract and retain the best employees, whose primary focus is increasing our clients' probability of success. We've consistently demonstrated our ability to execute effectively under a variety of market conditions and regardless of market conditions we believe that the innovation space, as the engine that drives the broader economy, is the best possible place to be for the long-term. Thank you.", "And now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Good afternoon, everyone. As Greg commented, we had a strong quarter marked by continued healthy balance sheet growth, strong core fee income and stable credit quality. The fourth quarter capped off a year where we continue to hit all time highs in most financial metrics and we believe we're well positioned for 2016. I would like to highlight a few items in my comments today, which I'll cover in detail shortly.", "First, exceptional loan growth. Second, strong growth in total client funds, both on and off balance sheet. Third, higher net interest income and a slightly higher net interest margin. Fourth, stable credit quality as we expected. Fifth, higher core fee income with continued momentum in foreign exchange and credit cards and payments. And sixth, higher expenses, primarily due to higher incentive compensation given our strong performance. Additionally, I'll discuss our capital levels, asset growth and provide details and updates on our full outlook for 2016.", "Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $829 million or 5.6% to $15.7 billion. Growth was driven primarily by capital call lines, to establish private equity clients although we saw healthy growth across the portfolio among new and existing clients. Period-end loans grew by $1.4 billion to $16.7 billion, primarily due to significant year end activity among our private equity clients, much of which occurred in the last month of the quarter. This provides us with a strong start to the year in terms of average balances. Although we could see some run off of period-end balances in the first half of the year as we did in 2015. As always we remain focused on high quality, smart loan growth with appropriate pricing, size and structure relative to our risk appetite and cost of capital. Nevertheless the strong activity we're seeing from high quality private equity clients and across our portfolio is providing upside to our targeted average loan growth range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion annually as well as to our original 2016 loan outlook which I will discuss shortly.", "Now let us move to total client funds, that is combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. Average total client funds grew by $3 billion or 3.8% to $82.3 billion, driven equally by deposits and client investment funds and marked by a significant increase in client activity during December. Growth in both deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds was driven by end of year activity among venture capital and private equity funds related to distributions, new funding rounds for early stage clients and new client acquisitions.", "Average on-balance sheet deposits grew by $1.5 billion or 4.1% to $38.9 billion and off-balance sheet client investment funds grew by $1.5 billion or 3.5% to $43.4 billion. Period-end total client funds grew by $2.5 billion or 3.1%, reflecting deposit growth of $2.1 billion or 5.7% and growth in client investment funds of $425 million or 1% to $44 billion.", "Turning to net interest income and our net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $14.4 million or 5.6% to $269 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was due primarily to higher loan growth. Interest income from loans increased by $10.4 million due to higher average loan balances. Loan yields increased modestly by 2 basis points to 4.67% primarily due to fees from early loan payoffs in the fourth quarter. Average fixed income securities increased by $621 million or 2.7% to $23.5 billion due to strong deposit growth. Yields on the overall portfolio increased by 1 basis point to 1.55% primarily as a result of lower premium amortization expense during the quarter due to higher market rates.", "New purchases of fixed income securities which totaled $2.5 billion overall were primarily in U.S. Treasury and Ginnie Mae securities with an overall average blended yield of 1.52%. Approximately $800 million of purchases were the result of portfolio cash flow reinvestments during the quarter. Portfolio duration in the fourth quarter remained consistent at 3.7 years. Our net interest margin increased by 4 basis points to 2.54% primarily due to growth in loans.", "Now let us move to credit quality. Our credit quality remained stable overall and is performing as expected. Here are the highlights. We recorded a loan loss provision of $31.3 million in the fourth quarter compared to $33.4 million in the third quarter. This amount reflected $13.1 million due to loan growth, $9.7 million related to charge-offs and $6.2 million of additional specific reserves on non-accrual loans. Non-performing loans increased by $7.9 million to $123.4 million driven primarily by one software loan. However, non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans decreased by 2 basis points to 73 basis points. Criticized loan balances remained consistent at 5.5% of total gross loans and remain below our 5 year average.", "I would like to provide a general update on the three non-performing loans in our sponsored buyout portfolio which we discussed in Q3. Consistent with our comments on our last earnings call, there has been no further deterioration in these loans. Moreover, we have had no new non-performing loans in our sponsored buyout portfolio and credit quality in the portfolio remained stable. The three loans have shown modest improvement, but we still need to see sustained performance over time before changing their status.", "Now let us move to non-interest income. I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. GAAP non-interest income was $114.5 million in the fourth quarter compared to $108.5 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interest was $111.8 million compared to $102.1 million in the third quarter. This number was driven by three components; core fee income, warrants and gains from investment securities. As a reminder, core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credit, deposit service charges, lending related fees and client investment fees.", "Core fee income was $72.7 million, an increase of $4.3 million or 6.3% over Q3. This increase was driven by record high foreign exchange revenues of $24 million compared to $23 million in Q3, reflecting higher volumes, and record high credit card and payment revenues of $15.8 million compared to $14.5 million in Q3, reflecting the ongoing implementation of our payment strategy. We had warrant gains of $16.4 million compared to $10.7 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by evaluation gains related to follow on funding rounds. Private equity and venture capital related investment gains net of non-controlling interest were $9.6 million compared to $12.7 million in the third quarter. These gains reflect the slower pace of exits during the quarter and included $6.5 million of gains in our strategic and other investments portfolio and $2.2 million of valuation gains from our managed funds of funds.", "Moving onto expenses, non-interest expense increased by $23.9 million or 13% to $208.6 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects a return to more normalized expense levels versus the third quarter in which we had a significant decrease in compensation expense due to lower incentive compensation.", "Turning to capital, our capital position remains healthy overall due to steady earnings and stable credit performance, although deposit and loan growth continue to drive average assets and risk-weighted assets higher which had an impact on the regulatory capital ratios. Our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio decreased by 4 basis points to 7.09%. Our risk based capital ratios, total risk capital and Tier 1 risk based capital, decreased at the bank and the holding company levels by approximately 25 basis points due to significant period-end loan growth.", "We continue to closely monitor the trend in our capital ratios, in particular our bank level Tier 1 leverage ratio for which our general target range is between 7% and 8%. We are also keeping an eye on our average asset growth as we get closer to the $50 billion mark. As Greg pointed out, we continue to enhance and invest in our risk management and compliance teams to meet increasing regulatory requirements and have been preparing for this for some time.", "Now I would like to discuss our 2016 outlook and in doing so provide some updates to the preliminary guidance that we provided in October. This outlook is for the full year 2016 versus the full year 2015 and balance sheet numbers are based on full year averages. Our outlook reflects the impact of the 25 basis point Fed funds increase we saw in December 2015 and assumes no additional rate increases in 2016. If there were any rate increases in 2016, we would adjust our guidance accordingly. I should remind you that this outlook is based on our current forecasts and assumptions about market conditions and is subject to change.", "Starting with loans, we expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens to the low 20s. This was an increase from our preliminary outlook of low double digit loan growth. It reflects stronger than expected end of period loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. We expect average deposit balances to grow at a percentage rate in the low double digits consistent with our preliminary outlook, although history has demonstrated that these balances can change quickly. We expect net interest income to grow at a percentage rate in the mid teens. This is also an increase from our original outlook of low double digits due to the impact of the 25 basis point Fed rate hike in December.", "We are raising our preliminary net interest margin outlook by 10 basis points to a range of between 2.5% and 2.7%, again this reflects the impact of the rate hike in December. We expect credit quality to remain comparable to 2015 levels, specifically we expect net loan charge offs of between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of average total gross loans. We expect non-performing loans of between 60 basis points and 100 basis points of total gross loans. And we expect our allowance for loan losses for performing loans to be comparable to 2015 levels.", "We expect core fee income to increase at a percentage rate in the mid 20s, an increase from our preliminary outlook of mid teens growth. This primarily reflects the impact of December's rate increase on our client investment fees and our improved outlook for foreign exchange and card fees. We expect noninterest expense to increase at a percentage rate in the high single digits consistent with our preliminary outlook. Keep in mind that if we outperformed on our financial metrics we could see higher incentive compensation, which would drive higher expense growth.", "Finally, while we do not provide an outlook for warrants and investment gains, venture investment levels, trends and funding amounts and the pace of M&A and IPOs in 2016 will all remain key factors to our overall earnings performance.", "In closing, we delivered a strong performance in the fourth quarter and for the full year. Our outlook for 2016 is positive and has improved since we provided our preliminary guidance last quarter, thanks to continued healthy activity among our clients and a small but welcome boost from interest rates. We remain focused on delivering the right kind of growth and maintaining stable credit quality. Although we are mindful of the environment in which we operate and the challenges presented by the economy and growing regulatory responsibilities, we see solid momentum across our business and we believe we are well positioned for 2016. Thank you.", "And now I would like to ask the operator to open the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Will now began the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zerbe", "Excellent. Good afternoon, guys. My first question, I was hoping to talk a little bit more about the loan growth outlook or more specifically what has changed in the outlook? Just looking at your preliminary guidance it seems that there is a lot of competition, you were seeing the right pricing. Why is your loan growth outlook stronger now than it was say a couple of months ago?", "Greg Becker", "So Ken. This is Greg, I'll start and then Mike may want to join in. So there is a couple of factors there. One, let me just get step back. We had talked over the last 12 months to two years and talked about kind of annualized growth rate of kind of a $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And what we have referenced is that the upside that could be above that if there is a number above that, usually would come from mainly private equity services capital call lending, so venture capital and PE partners as well some from the private bank. What we saw at the end of year, as we did the prior year not to some extent was a run up in capital call lending at year end, but mainly competitive equity partners, that's number one. Number two, as we sat down and we looked at our numbers and outlook backlog and all those things, the teams basically said that they believe that we can be even a stronger year in those same categories. So for those two reasons as we came and looked at our guidance we upped to the high teams to low 20s.", "Ken Zerbe", "All right, thank you. And then just another question for you, I guess help us understand, there has been such a huge amount of volatility in the market and I guess one of the concerns that myself and people I talked to have, is that loan growth could slow. Now frankly I understand your loan growth outlook just went up but help me to understand why VCs when they think about doing capital calls, you have even PEs, wouldn't slow investment just given the material amount of volatility that we are seeing in the markets?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg again. First of all it has been a short period of time and I'll give you a couple of data points right. So just over the last week as this volatility has been obviously very active and we have also experienced it, the number of rounds that we have seen closed that have been in the $25 million to $50 million to $75 million levels of activity, actually is consistent with what we saw in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, although it's just a much very short time period. So that's a very recent data point kind of to give you an example. We haven't seen any slowdown, that's number one. Number two is, as we spend time talking to investors and to capitalists, they have raised funds. But last year was a good fund raising year and money is coming in from a variety of different areas and the number of innovation companies is very broad. So we do still see that the activity levels although they might slow down are still going to be very healthy, that's kind of a broad umbrella. The second piece is a lot of the rounds that were the big fundings last year were to these larger and later stage companies. And these are companies that historically we would have seen working capital borrowings, we would have seen acquisition financing, we would have seen other sort of borrowings that we didn't see because there was so much equity capital going in. So from that standpoint we believe utilization could actually increase in some of the working capital facilities, as these companies get closer to profitability and are doing traditional working capital financing and not relying on equity. So those are kind of the reasons that we look at why we are still optimistic about loan growth in 2016.", "Ken Zerbe", "Great. All right, thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "I think the first question is going to Mike's comments on capital. If you can sort of help us think about within the capital stack where your preference is within the common equity in '14, assuming that last year, if you do decide to raise some capital, if there is a preference common versus debt or preferred?", "Mike Descheneaux", "I think which you are referring to is that our Tier 1 leverage ratio is getting closer to the lower end of our range and whether or not we are contemplating to raise capital or not and so let me just first fill it out. Our intensions right now are to do everything we can to avoid going to the capital markets. But as you know our deposit franchise is extremely strong and if it continues to grow, yes we may have to consider that. The answer to your question about whether it's a common or whether it's a preferred or whether it's debt, I mean obviously it just depends on the stage of the market when you go to. But generally I would probably say if we had to hypothetically and it's a big hypothetical would probably be -- as you have seen we have already demonstrated typically common but certainly the preferreds are always open. The route for debt is certainly available but not necessary to the certain extent because you are always mindful of your double leverage ratio between the whole co and the bank co again. That's based on the presumption, again big presumption that we would raise debt at whole co and [down, come] to the bank to increase the capital ratios. But again, Ebrahim, even with all of this is hypothetical they are still a number of levers that we are focused on to making sure our clients are getting their deposit into the right off-balance sheet products. There is also the potential with the recent rate increase and also potential profits going forward in the rate increases that could perhaps make those discussions much easier to actually have the clients to get them more interested. That, hey, look you can actually get a more appropriate yield off of the balance sheet which again is where your deposit probably should be in the first place. So there are still a number of things we would do before we would do that capital markets route.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Very clear. And in spite of that did I hear you correctly that as you get closer to $50 billion mix you passively could potentially hit at in the 2016, would you look to manage the asset growth to sort of delay crossing the $50 billion mark?", "Mike Descheneaux", "No. I think the short answer is no. I mean we always are very cognizant about return on capital from -- whether it's deposits or other relationships with clients. But again no plans to slowdown growth but it always is about what kind of ROE can we really get.", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. The only thing I would add on to that is, there is a -- if you are approaching $50 billion, if you end up at $48 billion, $49 billion and even now as we approach that number, the requirements that you would have by hitting that CCAR level at $50 billion, we already starting to work on those things and those things are already starting to be expected of us, not required but starting to be expected. So from that standpoint, we don't look at the bright line of $50 million maybe as bright as others may.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Understood. And if I could ask a second question just in terms of your NPA guidance. You are at 75 basis points given the range of 0.75% to 1%. I mean from the outside it seems like there has been a lot of weakness going back to some your response on loan growth over the last six to nine months, when I look at some of those VC funding in fourth quarter, tech IPOs. What gives you confidence and I recognize Greg you are one of the first guys to talk about potential bubble in some of the private markets. But what gives you confidence that charge off and NPAs will be manageable despite really potentially some more weakness as we go through the next few months?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I'll start, I am sure Marc will want to add. The one thing that -- I think it is important as starters to just take a look at our overall loan portfolio. And where we would see weakness, if there was, rounds that didn't close and companies have struggled to get equity raised would be in early stage. And so from that standpoint we want to make sure to all of our members that, that's a small portion of our overall portfolio roughly 8% of our overall loan portfolio. While we have grown in the last two or three years, we've grown there, but it's been modest relative to what we've done in private equity, which is very low risk, what we've done in the private bank, which is a very low risk and in other areas. And what we try to talk about in prior calls and sponsor-led buyout is those companies tend to have lower leverage than you would see in traditional industries. So we've kind of stuck to our knitting. We haven't expanded our EBITDA levels, multiples even when the market's heated up. We have lost more deals, our growth has slowed down there, but we think that's the prudent or smart way to grow that business. So we feel good about the portfolio construction and we haven't seen any activity that would cause us to say that there is a change in behavior of venture capitalists. But again even if you did see some, our cushion that we have built in, when you look at that outlook, we believe again unless there is something more dramatically happen could absolutely withstand that.", "Marc Cadieux", "The only thing I would add to that is in addition to credit quality being stable throughout '15 and in the second half of the year. One of the things that we did not see was anything out of pattern in connection with investor behavior. But we did see one thing that was encouraging in terms of the companies themselves and that was so to speak, an increasing number of companies starting to prioritize positive cash flow over cash burn for revenue growth. Putting back together with what on average in our borrowing client base would be a fairly robust balance sheet liquidity. The combination of prioritizing positive cash flow and having more cash on the balance sheet than usual given the fund raising environment, yes, I think helps give me some comfort that we're not going to see anything that would hopefully impact or change our guidance for credit quality. And then I think just going back to buyouts, because that really was the source of the non-performing loan increase in the main in 2015. Again we didn't add anything new there in the fourth quarter and credit quality in that segment of the portfolio looked stable overall.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Just on credit first. With the handful of charge offs in the early stage portfolio, can you give us color in terms of what you're seeing on the funding side and the ability to really [stage] clients to go out and get that next round to pay off the loan?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I'll start and then again Mike will add to it. You could look at the venture capital numbers in the fourth quarter, roughly $11 billion, depends on what data source you look from. The number was $58 billion for the year, the $44 billion annualized level, we look at that and that's a more normal level. I wouldn't be surprised, if you kind of see that number carry forward into 2016 on a quarterly basis. So that's still a healthy number, number one. Number two, let's remember there is other sources of capital and there is still a lot of money around looking for the innovation autonomy. There is still more corporate venturing than we've ever had and I believe this time, I have spent the time with several of them. And they are not -- their approach isn't a short-term from my standpoint, go in and try to make some money, it's more strategic and here is what's different about it this time compared to last time. Companies have to look at investing in new disruptive technologies to protect their business and to grow their business more than ever. And so therefore it's not -- and from my view its optional as it was historically whether they invest or not in innovation and new technologies. That's a very different set of circumstances than we had before when you look at the Asia market. So there is a broader source of capital than we had before, still a healthy number in the fourth quarter of venture capital. There was a strong year of fund raising last year for venture capital firms. And then last point, which is your first question is, did we see any change in behavior in the fourth quarter and the answer was no we didn't.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "All right, that's very helpful, appreciate that. Just to change gears for a second on off balance sheet client funds. Can you give us a sense how much did your revenue from your off balance sheet funds increase by or what should have increased by tied to the December hike? I imagine they was a little bit more there. And in terms of the [rate field] alternatives that you are now able to offer does that change enough to make it easier for you guys to redirect funds off balance sheet?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Steve this is Greg. So on the first question with the off balance sheet is, 25 basis points gives us a couple of basis points of increase that we look at which doesn't sound like a whole lot. But when you look at it on a $40 billion portfolio that actually does become meaningful, number one. Number two, and again that gives you some belief that as rates increase and we hope they will continue, maybe not at the level they were expected to but we believe maybe one or two increases this year. There will be more lift in that category. So that's one answer to your first question. Second question is and Mike kind of highlighted this, it does help. It makes the conversation easier. You can go to a client and say, moving that money off balance sheet, it was 5 basis points before is what you could get and now you can get off balance sheet 20 or 25. That's compelling, especially when you are talking about the dollars, you are talking about whether it's a $50 million or $75 million or $100 million balance. So it does make the conversation easier. It's kind of what Mike said about the [similar] tool in our tool box that we can use to make sure that we are managing those capital ratios appropriately without having to go to the capital markets to raise more capital equity or debt.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay that's helpful. I hope you don't mind, I am going to try and sneak one more in. This is the valuation we have, we don't see that often for your stock right. Will you guys consider using any cash at the holding company to buy back stock here?", "Mike Descheneaux", "We've been talking about the Tier 1 leverage ratio, albeit at the bank level at the holding company and as we've talked about at least to the bank level we want to tell you that's 7% to 8% and similarly if you can kind of a corresponding proportion for the holding companies as well too. I just don't think we are in a position right now that we would do that and despite the fact that we all believe our stock price looks attractive. We continue to have strong growth that we got to continue to redeploy our growth in capital, redeploy the backend and investing into the bank to continue to grow. So at this time I don't think we would be in a position to do that.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. Thanks for all the color guys.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "Hi. Good evening. Thank you. Most of the questions were answered and asked but could you give us an update maybe on what to expect as you go through the year from Volcker and any changes we can expect to see in the balance sheet as you sort of approach the implementation date and the full implementation date of that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yes. I mean, generally as you probably heard us talk about really the next which in dates would be in 2017 ourselves, so there is obviously some time left. We here now have stopped making any new commitments into that area. So what's -- over time you are going to see those balances to continue to come down. Now when we get to 2017 depending on where our levels at we would we still need to bring down those levels over the investments, we would look to certainly request for an extension but again at this point we still have some time away before that time comes.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, great thanks. And then just on credit, could you give us an update on what the breakdown is on the allowance between specific reserve and unallocated reserve?", "Marc Cadieux", "This is Marc. So what I would suggest is you wait till we get out our full 10-K which will give you the more disclosures with respect to the breakout of the credit and reserves. But generally as you have probably have seen through the time it is essentially has been fairly consistent and there has not been any significant moves one way or the other.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay. So there wasn't any real big move in that as you went through the fourth quarter?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Generally using wide percentage ranges generally no.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Deer", "Hi. Good afternoon everyone. You guys are obviously disinclined to give a guidance on the warrant and equity gains or potential for those in a way. But I guess for those [listening] outside, you guys have the best visibility in terms of what your holdings are and are seeing in a very current activity in terms of up and down rounds in funding. Is there any way that just to help to give us something that work with? You can give us a sense also in terms of the direction and magnitude of what you would expect for equity market gains in 2016?", "Greg Becker", "Aaron. This is Greg. I'll start and so we don't give guidance on it. But let me give you [indiscernible]. One is that, you said that we have a good visibility to up rounds and down rounds and again what we saw through the fourth quarter was no, I'll call meaningful, and I honestly can't even think of any or many down rounds that we saw. Do we think that's going to change, so that's going to change. But when you look at it, the market -- these companies continue to still perform, it's a broad statement, perform at a very high level, number one. Number two, going to back to what Mike said, they're refocusing their efforts on growing and becoming cash flow positive. We think those are good signs and there is availability of capital. So we don't believe it's going to be a complete shrinking of capital in 2016. So that down rounds are going to be the norm but of course it will happen. So we expect it to be lower than last year, absolutely, but we're still feeling okay about the outlook. And the last point I'd make is, one thing I'd pay attention to is when you look at our filings and look at the number of warrants that we actually have. We continue to take warrants actually at a faster pace and it has been that way for the last few years and that gives you a sign and it may not be for this year because that's what difficult to predict. But the trend is that we continue to take warrants and if there are down rounds that's going to be a good opportunity for us to price rounds at warrants at a lower level.", "Mike Descheneaux", "The one thing Aaron companies don't add on is as you know probably, generally you have to monitor and follow what's the state of the IPO activity or M&A activity. Those two things are continued to be strong going in 2017 particularly M&A then you could likely see some nice gains there. Obviously continue to watch the stock market and the evaluations there as well too, look for tax spending as well too. But sometimes unfortunately we get some bad press or headlines that all the IPO activity has slowed down or ended, but the reality is a lot of the exits from whether its warrants or in investment gains really comes from M&A and again that has demonstrated over the past year that's pretty healthy and is likely probably to continue at least a healthy clip.", "Greg Becker", "And maybe just add onto that, as the last part is on the M&A, is that it goes back to one of my comments. That thinking about the activity levels of these technology companies that are the larger more mature companies, I believe you're going to see a greater activity level of acquisitions and M&A than you even saw in the last few years because of their focus on how can they fill their R&D pipelines. They have to figure out how to grow and differentiate themselves and that's happening with technology companies, innovation companies in that early and mid stage level. So you may see a little bit of change here and there and you may see a slowdown, but I think it will pick back up if it does very quickly.", "Aaron Deer", "Thanks for the additional color. And then for my follow-on, I am just curious to know kind of what you've been seeing in the first few weeks of the year in terms of any pay downs? Obviously there is a big run up at the end of the year and have seen any of those pay down early in the first quarter just curious to know what you might have seen there?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yes, I will just give you some general color and I think you might well discern it from some of our comments. We did talk about that we had a strong run up in capital call lines and the private equity and we've mentioned in the notes and the comments that look, you could see something similar to what happened last year which is we may hold through the first and maybe go into second quarter and then you may see some pay downs. But going into 2016 as we said the balances look strong at this point in time seemingly at the holding and we'd probably be expecting the whole fairly well but again there is always the risk to pullback as you are alluding to.", "Aaron Deer", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "I guess first just a quick follow-up on Aaron's on the warrants, can you just remind us Mike I guess how you carry them on the book? As I recall there is some discounts for liquidity and time value of money that I guess would also give you a little cushion for potential down valuations?", "Mike Descheneaux", "I don't know if I described this cushion per se. But as you know we carried at a fair value in a way we value the warrants as using the Black-Scholes model which has a few inputs certainly which you can certainly look up to, but it is certainly at fair value. The larger drivers is whether there is an up or down round aka the stock price component of the Black-Scholes model is still in the risk free rate, there is a time value of money, there is a volatility factor as well too. And then obviously the fifth factor in the Black-Scholes model is dividends which obviously none of these pay. So really it is just fair value that we market each quarter.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Joe this is Greg. One of the things you may be thinking about is in the investment securities portfolio. So we do have -- there is kind of two different parts, one is held at fair market value and then there is others that are held at cost and it's basically the structure of the investment. And if you look back over the last quarter there was roughly between $80 million and $100 million of value difference between the cost, which is what we're carrying it at and the fair market value. And that's in the financial statements. If you're talking about I guess some cushion that's one place where you may see it.", "Joe Morford", "Okay that's helpful. I guess the other thing was, I noticed that 20% of your average deposit growth this quarter came from new client additions, how does that compare to prior period and I guess you touched on this a little bit, but what can you tell us about your expectations for to pace some new client additions, new company formations in the coming year given the environment that we're in right now?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg, Joe, I'll start and I just think when you look at new client additions, the last couple of years have been very strong and so they have obviously contributed to it. So I don't think there has really been a change materially from new client contributions versus existing client contributions. ", "Joe Morford", "Okay, thank you so much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Juliana Balicka from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Juliana Balicka", "Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on a couple of the topics that have been raised. One, Aaron brought up the outflows in terms of the loan, someone has ask about the seasonal [indiscernible] of deposits, what should occur in next quarter given the short-term volumes that you put on the balance sheet at the very end of the quarter, has that already flown out or [indiscernible] timing, should we expecting for that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So this is Mike. We don't really see, I'd say characterization of seasonal flow deposits for us. I mean, as you've seen it's pretty much been consistent growth for last several years in deposits, so at this juncture, at this point, we've really don't anticipate any major change in that. Now again as we alluded to, we've talked about how maybe perhaps the higher interest rates might be able to help us move some clients deposit parts to off balance sheet. But in general as Greg was also telling, the company's formation has continued to be healthy and some of the funding rounds were healthy even getting towards the end of December as well too. So we don't really see any sort of pattern at the moment, in terms of deposit outflows related in the seasonal items.", "Juliana Balicka", "And borrowing that you have after year end on December 31 to short-term volumes that are already gone?", "Mike Descheneaux", "No, as we -- we commented about that as well. We actually think it may happen similar to what happened last year, where the loan actually held fairly well going into Q2 of last year. So we possibly could see a similar experience. The categorical answer is we really have not seen any major run off so far this quarter.", "Juliana Balicka", "Okay. And then also -- I just want to ask in terms of the capital call on growth that you've been experiencing in a VC, PE lines could you break up between VC and PE for us and also are you seeing an incremental trend in terms of latter stage PEs maybe those are focused on [other trust] companies or anything to comment on the mix between those two?", "Greg Becker", "As you may have guessed we really don't break it down between PE and VC, but I'd just say generally a lot of the strength in the growth over the last couple of quarters has been driven primarily by some of the PE. I mean there is just much more larger dollars and more funds and firms there in order to grow. So that's where we are seeing the predominant amount of growth. There certainly is still some growth in the VC area but it's largely driven by the PE area.", "Mike Descheneaux", "One thing I would add is that our PE clients invest across multiple asset classes. They are actually very few that are focusing on distressed assets.", "Juliana Balicka", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question is comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good afternoon. On credit, can you give us just a little bit more color on the early stage credit that hit NPLs and on that point I think Marc you said that there was one software credit that hit NPLs but I think in Page 5 of your release you indicate that there is two loans one software, one Internet. So I just wanted you to reconcile that as well, thanks.", "Mike Descheneaux", "So, maybe first starting with the one significant addition to NPLs and what was responsible for the $7.9 million increase, it was actually a later stage software company that's encountered some operating performance challenges. But to your point not related to early stage. And then I think the comment might be in thinking about what was in the release. The charge offs in the fourth quarter, was primarily driven by three loans, all of them early stage, two in the software space, one in life science. Is that you're alluded to?", "John Pancari", "While I am looking at Page 5, you stated the new nonaccrual loans included $12.5 million from two early stage clients in software and internet loan portfolio.", "Greg Becker", "So, we're looking at that.", "Marc Cadieux", "So that references, seem to be related to charge offs but as I mentioned, it says gross loan charge-offs, total $11.6 million including $3.8 million from the two early stage clients that are our software segment as I've mentioned and then $3.1 million early stage loan loss from the life science and healthcare portfolio.", "John Pancari", "Yes, and I was looking at two paragraphs below that.", "Greg Becker", "I'm sorry. So there was the first software company that I mentioned, again the one that was big driver. That is one of the drivers of the increase in specific reserves. The other was a early stage loan, similarly in software space. Hoping that answered your question.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And again nothing to flag in the early stage loan book, that is anything systemic or anything at this point?", "Marc Cadieux", "No. As I said in the case for as long as I've been here, generally our loan losses come from early stage regardless of where you are in the cycle. It's kind of the nature of venture and not everything in early stage works. But what we saw in the fourth quarter is very consistent with what I'd characterize as in the normal range. And in particular as we mentioned earlier, no change, anything discernible related to pull back in valuations or market volatility or any of the things that we saw in the second half of 2015 and so far this year.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Marc, thanks. Mike on the spread revenue benefit from higher rates, I know you indicated that you do not model or you are not expecting additional Fed hikes in 2016. If we did see 25 basis points of a hike, can you just remind us of the net interest income benefit from that?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Let's just wait till we come out with the 10-K to show you the general, but you can refer to the past in the 10-Q about the impact of the rate increases.", "John Pancari", "Okay. So not materially different.", "Mike Descheneaux", "That will be directionally consistent. Yes.", "John Pancari", "And then lastly on the drivers of loan growth, I just wanted if you could kind of give us a bit more color on '16. I mean is it fair to assume that the bulk of the loan growth is totally concentrated in the capital call lines, in terms of how you are expecting it or can you just talk about the distribution across the later stage versus capital call versus early stage and buyout?", "Greg Becker", "Sure, this is Greg. So you're going to see greater numbers, bigger numbers from private equity. Secondarily you will see it again in the private bank, you will see it in global and those are kind of the sequencing and a prioritization of where the growth is coming from. And below that you are going to see growth consistent across the other industries, which is life sciences, technology, later stage, early stage. So that's a good breakdown of what we see happening from a growth perspective.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Thank you.", "Meghan O'Leary", "I am just going to interject here, we're at 4 O'clock but we are going to keep going and get your questions answered, so keep on asking.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Hello, thank you for taking the question. How do you stress the portfolio for an environment where financing just dries up for VC companies and what does perhaps stress testing show you?", "Greg Becker", "So Geoff this is Greg. So when we look at -- so we have done stress testing for a while and although we are not required to do stress testing, and what I call idiosyncratic, so this is one of the guidance is that the Fed gives you, they don't talk about a tech impact. We obviously do that and from a stand point of how we are looking at it, we feel good about it. And here is an important point, when we see the stress in the portfolio we keep referencing back and I'll reiterate that 8% of the portfolio is at early stage. That's where you see the stress. That's when we would see a big impact. But if you look at that and even if you had a 10% loss in that, you're looking at 80 basis points across the overall portfolio. Now you can see in other parts of the portfolio as well, but it's mainly early stage. So that's one way to think about stress overall, but we obviously don't publish the details of that. So it is part of our risk management.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And could you just remind us the kind of breakdown of the portfolio into pre-revenue, pre-profit and then profitable company as well? What does that look like?", "Marc Cadieux", "So it's Marc Cadieux again and I think the pre-profit and what we think of as early stage being -- early revenue -- again zero to early revenue stage is really the 8% that Greg is talking about, is that category.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "The next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Brett Rabatin", "Hi, good afternoon. Just a quick one on expenses. Just want to make sure I understood the incremental spend as you're approaching $50 billion. Can you give us maybe a little color on what you've done so far and then incrementally what you need to do as you approach that number from here?", "Mike Descheneaux", "We haven't come out and commented exactly how much we're spending. Part of the challenge is we obviously have been growing extremely fast and our expense growth rates have obviously been growing as well as we invest in our business. So we have not broken that out to give you any indication of that. But having said that, we are continuing to invest and spend money, but it's not as something that you're going to really notice any pickup in our expense rate, the run rate at the current rate. We have been investing for a number of years, so it's kind of in our run rate and we'll incrementally continue to add. But again once again it's just not going to raise [indiscernible] for you to see necessarily any major changes in our expense growth rates.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Gary Tenner with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.", "Gary Tenner", "Thanks. Two quick questions. One I just wanted you to tell us what the average new loan yield was for the fourth quarter?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Average across the portfolio. I'm not sure we're have it for the fourth quarter isolation, but it's in the plus or minus 4% across the portfolio.", "Gary Tenner", "Okay, great. And then I know you've said you're not going to provide guidance on the Chinese joint venture, until we get to closer to 2017. But I wondered if you could just comment on kind of what your perception is of that market from sort of tech investment and strength perspective given the overall slowdown?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. There is certainly two aspects of it. One is the last two years in venture capital activity. Although, we've had a robust growth in venture capital activity in the U.S., the growth in venture capital numbers actually is even stronger on a percentage growth in '14 and '15. So as we look at that market we do expect a pull back there, but potentially even greater than what we see in the U.S.. That being said, in the innovation economy, in China continues to be on an uptick. And you think about it, what's happening in China actually ends up not being negative for the innovation economy. So China has got two different markets, they have innovation economy and the old economy. Old economy is one that's struggling and they've got to figure how to balance that. So which means that more than likely, they're going to reemphasize or increase their emphasis on innovation economy which from our standpoint bodes well. And actually would may over time accelerate that. So we feel good about what we're looking at in China about the outlook. But remember as we said in the last call, this is a long-term strategy. So you're not going to see very much change in the next 12 months, 18 months with our financials from any real impact on China.", "Gary Tenner", "Right. Thanks for the color.", "Operator", "We have no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back to Greg Becker for final comments.", "Greg Becker", "Great. So I want to just thank everyone for joining us today. We had a record year in 2015, which I'm extremely proud of. But what I am even more proud of is how our team and that means all 2,000 plus SVBers executed on our strategy and took great care of our plans. Our outlook for 2016 is strong despite this early volatility that we've seen. We tried to give you as much color as we could and have seen on that. And we remain committed to long-term smart growth. So I want to thank all our employees for doing such a great job in 2015 and getting excited about 2016 and to our clients for putting their trust in us and hopefully trust for many years to come.", "With that have a great 2016.

My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today's call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Director of Investor Relations Meghan O'Leary. Miss O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you Adrian and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker and CFO Mike Descheneaux are here to talk about our first quarter 2016financial results and will be joined by other members of Management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the investor relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We will be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call. In addition some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We will limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you Meghan and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered a solid quarter in terms of our core business, with earnings per share of $1.52 and net income of $79.2 million. These results were marked by robust loan growth and healthy fee income. At the same time, downward pressure on valuations and investments resulted in lower securities and warrant gains which impacted EPS for the quarter. Mike will get into details of the quarter shortly. I'd like to talk primarily about the environment we're in and how we're thinking about it. In the simplest terms, we believe the VC markets are experiencing a healthy shift, one that comes with near term challenges for some companies but is positive overall. ", "We have been talking about valuations and [indiscernible] for several quarters and we're not really surprised about what we're seeing. We believe there is still much to be optimistic about and we remain positive about our clients and our outlook. Let's start with the state of the markets. The economic landscape is unsettled. While concerns of a recession appear to have receded somewhat, market sentiment and the economic outlook seem to change day to day. The interest rate outlook is equally unclear and we're not counting on help from rates this year. The tech markets seem to have calmed somewhat following a volatile first quarter, sparked by a long buildup of fears over a possible unicorn bubble. While those fears may have been overstated, valuations have pulled back and capital is tightening, especially for early-stage companies.", "The IPO market was all but closed in the first quarter for tech companies which had zero IPOs compared to only six life science companies, making this the slowest quarter for IPOs since the third quarter of 2011. VC investment overall remained relatively robust, although the number and dollars of investments in seed and early-stage companies spell approximately 20%. So the VC and IP markets are somewhat challenging, but there are bright spots as well. First, entrepreneurs and investors are beginning to replace the growth at any cost mentality that led to high valuations of recent years with a focus on profitability and slower burn rates. This shift in focus, as well as more reasonable valuations, should make the private market healthier overall.", "Second, we're seeing our clients in general deliver on solid revenue growth, helped by strong demand for their innovative products and solutions. Third, after a long period of robust fundraising, VCs have substantial amounts of capital to invest, alongside many new sources of non-venture capital. This is the opposite of the situation VCs and entrepreneurs faced in 2008. This ample capital should ensure good companies will still be able to get funding. And fourth, while the IPO markets may remain weak for some time, lower valuations could drive an increase in M&A by corporates and private equity firms. This is a dynamic we saw emerge during the 2008 recession.", "In short, we see a healthy re-calibration and not the beginning of a material downturn. While the markets may slow for a few quarters as investors and entrepreneurs evaluate their next steps, we believe this is likely to be a beneficial period of adjustment. Nevertheless, we believe continued slow early-stage VC investment and a dormant IPO market could affect us in three potential ways. More investor dependent companies may fail and we could see more early-stage charge-offs as a result, although these are not unusual in any environment. If that happens, we believe these charge-offs would be manageable, because our early-stage loans tend to be small and make up only 6% of our loan portfolio.", "As you know, we have been mindful of overheating in the credit markets for several years now and have chosen to walk away from deals that do not fit our risk appetite. Slower VC and IPO markets could result in a slowdown or pullback in deposits. However, slower burn rates, increased focus on profitability at our client companies and a healthy new client growth may help to offset this risk. VC and warrant gains would probably be pressured as we saw in the first quarter, especially if the IPO market remains weak. These are potential challenges, but we believe our business environment remains healthy and we continue to see strength and momentum in key areas. For instance, we had excellent client growth during the quarter, adding roughly 1000 new company clients which is just below our average of 1100 per quarter in 2015.", "Demand for loans remains healthy, driven primarily by our highest credit quality segments, private equity and private bank and any tightenings of equity capital could lead to increased utilization on credit facilities of our other clients. Our fee business continues to grow due to our focus on expanding our client base, growing globally and cross-selling. These efforts have helped drive compound annual growth rates of more than 25% in both foreign-exchange and card revenue over the last three years. As we'll see in our forecast, we expect strong growth to continue. ", "We continued to make progress in our payments platform. We marked a major milestone in the first quarter, partnering with Stripe to provide banking service for its new Stripe Atlas platform which allows entrepreneurs to start a global Internet business from anywhere in the world. This new program has gotten a tremendous global reception and we expect the Stripe Atlas relationship to be a fantastic new banking origination channel for SVB. We're very excited to be a strategic partner with Stripe. Globally, we announced plans to expand our fast-growing branch in London. SVB has become a vital partner to companies in that thriving ecosystem in a very short time and the branch just crossed $1 billion of funded loans. All of these things make us optimistic about 2016. We're thinking much bigger and longer term about our future and we're making significant changes to our business so that we can take advantage of the opportunities we see.", "To that end, as you know, we made a number of changes to our organization structure last year, specifically appointing Bruce Wallace as Chief Digital Officer, hiring Mike Dreyer as Chief Operations Officer and Roger Leone as Chief Information Officer. These changes are designed to support expansion of our payments and digital efforts and growth as a globally scalable business. And they are part of a conscious, long-standing commitment to investing in people and enhancing our processes and systems so that today, we're more sophisticated, adept and resilient organization than we ever have been.", "For now, we're keeping a close eye on our clients and the shifting conditions of early-stage companies, while maintaining our focus on effective execution regardless of the market environment. While the environment is more challenging as investors and companies adjust to new realities, our view is that this is a moderation rather than a material correction. We continue to believe whatever shifts the innovation space makes in the near term, it offers tremendous opportunities in the long term and is the best possible place for us to be.", "Thank you and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Greg and good afternoon everyone. As Greg pointed out, we had a solid quarter despite a slower pace of early-stage funding, lower public market valuations and fewer exits. Specifically, we saw a significant decline in net gains from warrants and investments in private equity and venture capital which impacted EPS in the quarter. The items I will cover in detail include the following. First, loans which grew significantly. Second, a modest decline in total client fund balances. Third, higher net interest income and net interest margin. Fourth, healthy overall credit quality despite some stress in the early-stage portfolio. Fifth, lower warrant gains and modest investment securities losses. Sixth, higher core fee income.", "Seventh, lower expenses and finally, increased capital levels. Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $1.3 billion or 8%, to a record high of $17 billion, driven by growth in private equity capital call lines during the first quarter and the impact of strong loan growth in the fourth quarter of 2015. Period end loans grew by $993 million, to $17.7 billion, as we saw those fourth quarter loan balances hold, although we could see some runoff of capital call lines in the second quarter. Now let us move to total client funds. That is combined on balance sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds.", "Average total client funds decreased by $600 million or less than 1%, reflecting average deposit growth of $400 million or 1% and a decrease in off-balance-sheet client investment funds of $1 billion or 2.2%. Period end total client funds decreased by $2.1 billion or 2.6%, reflecting a decrease in period end deposits of $383 million or 1% and a decrease in off-balance-sheet investment funds of $1.7 billion or 3.9%. These decreases were the first we have seen since 2009 and reflect three primary drivers during the quarter.", "First, M&A activity by and of our growth and corporate finance stage clients were the primary drivers of the decreases in off-balance-sheet client investment funds. Second, inflows from our early-stage clients from equity funding rounds drove the increase in average deposit balances, although that impact was offset somewhat by a modest runoff in private equity balances, following a strong fourth quarter due to distributions by our clients. And third, efforts by our corporate finance clients to take advantage of higher-yielding off-balance-sheet investments were the primary driver of lower period end deposits balances. While we could see tempering in client fund flows if early-stage investment continues to slow and the IPO markets remain dormant, as Greg pointed out, slowing burn rates and strong new company acquisition could offset these impacts. In any case, it is too soon to declare a trend. ", "Turning to net interest income and our net interest margin. Net interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased by $12.3 million or 4.6%, to $282 million in the first quarter, due to strong loan growth and the impact of the increase in the Fed funds rate in December. Interest income from loans increased by $12.5 million, due to higher average loan balances. Loan yields increased by one basis point, reflecting an increase of 8 basis points in gross loan yields due to the full quarter impact of the Fed funds rate increase which was offset by a decline in fees from early loan payoffs. Average fixed income securities decreased modestly, $184 million, to $23.4 billion, due to the sale of $1.9 billion of treasury securities to support our loan growth and cash balances. As a result, interest income from investment securities was essentially flat in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. ", "Our net interest margin increased by 13 basis points to 2.67%, primarily due to growth in loans and the full quarter impact of the Fed funds rate increase in December. Now let us move to credit quality which remains healthy overall. Given the slower pace of early-stage funding, it was not surprising that we saw some stress in our early-stage portfolio. We also saw higher criticized loan balances from a handful of larger loans. However, these were not driven by any overarching trend.", "Overall, credit quality is performing as we expected. Total loan loss provision was $33.3 million in the first quarter, compared to $31.3 million in the prior quarter. This amount reflected approximately $9.5 million due to loan growth, $20.7 million related to net charge-offs and a $3.9 million increase in reserves. Net charge-offs were $20.7 million or 49 basis points, compared to $11.2 million or 28 basis points in the fourth quarter. This reflects $26.2 million in gross charge-offs, of which 60% came from early-stage loans, with most of the remainder from one loan to a later stage e-commerce company. Net charge-offs also reflect $5.5 million of recoveries, primarily related to the repayment of a loan that became impaired in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Nonperforming loans decreased by $9.4 million, to $114 million or 64 basis points, compared to 73 basis points in the fourth quarter. This improvement was primarily driven by the resolution of two loans, the loan recovery I just mentioned and a sponsored buyout loan that became impaired in the third quarter of 2015. The sponsored buyout loan was repaid in full with no charge-offs and resulted in a reserve release of $7.2 million. These resolutions were offset by the addition of 10 nonperforming loans that were mostly in the early-stage portfolio. These loans tend to be quite granular and this level of new early-stage nonperforming loans is consistent with prior quarters.", "The two other sponsored buyout loans that became nonperforming in 2015 appear to be on a path to improved performance. Criticized loan balances increased to 6.1% of total gross loans, compared to 5.5% in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven by a handful of larger loans, each of which became criticized for reasons specific to the borrower. We do not expect significant migration of these loans to nonperforming or charge-offs. Our allowance for loan losses held steady at 1.29% of total gross loans. Our allowance for loan losses for performing loans increased 2 basis points, to 1.01%.", "And finally, the allowance for loan losses for nonperforming loans decreased by $1.4 million, to $50.4 million, reflecting $11 million of reserves for new nonperforming loans. Offset by the reserve release from repayment of the sponsored buyout loan noted earlier and $5.2 million of other reserve releases related to charge-offs and loan repayment. Now let us move to no-interest income which is largely composed of core fee income and net gains and losses from warrants and investment securities.", "I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. GAAP non-interest income was $86.1 million, compared to $114.5 million in the fourth quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest, was $88.8 million compared to $111.8 million in the fourth quarter. The decrease in non-interest income in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter was driven by a modest net loss on investment securities and lower gains on warrants, primarily related to valuation pull-backs for public companies and a lack of VC-backed exits. This was the lowest level of combined net warrant and securities gains, excluding the volatility we saw in 2014 from one company, since the first quarter of 2012.", "Losses on investment securities, net of non-controlling interest, were $2 million compared to net gains of $9.6 million in the fourth quarter. This reflects $3.9 million of losses related to unrealized valuation decreases tied to a decrease in market prices of public positions held by certain of our funds of funds. This was partially offset by $2.4 million of realized gains in our strategic funds driven by distributions.", "Other components included $2.2 million of losses on sales of exercised warrant securities that were subject to lockup agreements during the first quarter's public market decline, offset somewhat by a $1.4 million gain from the sale of treasury securities which I noted earlier. We had warrant gains of $6.6 million, compared to $16.4 million in the fourth quarter. These were primarily realized gains from warrant exercises due to M&A among our clients. We had only $400,000 in valuation gains compared to $12 million in the fourth quarter, due to the pullback in valuations overall. Core fee income was $76.5 million, an increase of $3.8 million or 5.2% over Q4.", "As a reminder, core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, letters of credit, deposit service charges, lending related fees and client investment fees. This increase was driven primarily by foreign exchange and client investment fees. FX income was solid at $27 million. While the increase compared to Q4 was primarily driven by a reclassification of fees on forward contracts previously reflected in gains and losses on derivative instruments, we were coming off a record quarter in Q4 in terms of volume and revenues. FX income is up 50% compared to the same quarter in 2015.", "We saw a 29% increase in client investment fees, to $8 million, due primarily to money fund rate increases in our client investment funds which were supported by an increase in short term rates. This represents a 78% increase over the same quarter in 2015. Credit card and payment income was $15.5 million in the first quarter, modestly below our fourth quarter income which was a record high. Nevertheless, first quarter 2016 credit card and payment income increased 28% over the same quarter in 2015, attesting to our continued momentum in implementing our credit card and payment strategy.", "Moving on to expenses. Non-interest expense decreased by $4.6 million or 2.1%, to $204.1 million. This decrease primarily relates to a decline in incentive compensation levels and seasonality in Q1 expenses. Incentive compensation was $10 million lower in comparison to higher than normal fourth quarter levels, driven by our strong 2015 performance. Professional service fees decreased by $5 million, reflective of changes due to timing of certain projects. These decreases were offset by an increase of $3.5 million in salaries and wages reflecting higher average FTE and $5.7 million of seasonal expense related to 401(k) matching and employer payroll taxes.", "Turning to capital, our capital position remains healthy due to solid earnings and we saw increases in all key capital ratios. Our bank level tier 1 leverage ratio increased by 10 basis points, to 7.19%, due to earnings and tempered average deposit growth in the first quarter. Our risk-based capital ratios, that is total risk-based capital and tier 1 risk-based capital, increased at the bank and the holding company levels by approximately 6 basis points.", "We continue to closely monitor the trend in our capital ratios and in particular our bank level tier 1 leverage ratio, for which our target range is between 7% and 8%. If deposit levels continue to temper, assuming no material changes in the economic environment or business conditions, we do not believe we would have to raise capital in 2016. If we were to see a return to deposit growth trends of past quarters or other changes in our capital position, we believe we have some options that we could pursue before raising capital. However, if we did raise capital to support our growth at some point, they we consider preferred equity as an option.", "Moving on to our outlook. We're making one improvement to our full-year 2016 outlook and that is the narrowing of our expectations for loan growth from our original range of the high teens to low 20s, to just the low 20s. Additionally, I would like to provide color on two of our outlook items, to give you a better idea of how we think they may trend during 2016.", "First, we believe deposit growth is likely to be near the bottom of our outlook range of the low double digits, due to a slower pace of early-stage funding and fewer exits. Second, continue pressure on valuations and a tough exit environment could mean more early-stage loan charge-offs and reserves, similar to what we saw in the first quarter. While these levels are not exceptional, they could mean that we could see full-year 2016 net charge-offs closer to the top of our outlook range of 50 basis points of average total gross loans. Furthermore, we could also expect to see loan loss provision levels for the rest of the year, on average, in line with the first quarter, although I am not suggesting that they would be identical from quarter to quarter.", "Finally, while we do not provide an outlook for net gains or losses from warrants and investment securities, I want to remind you that we expect lower early-stage investment levels, downward pressure on valuations and a slower pace of exits to put considerable pressure on gains from warrants and investment securities in 2016. In closing, we delivered a solid quarter in terms of our core business. We believe the slower pace of early-stage investment in Q1 and the ongoing re-calibration evaluations are healthy developments. While our early-stage clients may feel the impact of this shift more than others, our clients overall appear to be doing well. ", "Nevertheless, we're paying close attention to the market shifts we saw in the first quarter and monitoring their potential impact. We expect our experience in the innovation industry, our multiple touch points with clients and investors, as well as our insight into our clients' businesses, will serve us well. In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering high quality growth and maintaining stable credit quality. While we're mindful of the challenges presented by the environment in which we operate, the economy and the regulatory landscape and we believe we're well positioned.", "Thank you and now I will ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "I wanted to start on the capital calls, looking at the very strong growth in capital calls above $20 million which I assume were mostly private equity. Could you give more color on what drove that magnitude of growth this quarter? And was it funds investing outside of tech?", "Greg Becker", "So Steve, it's Greg. I will start and then Mark is going to add some additional color. It was pretty broad based. It was private equity, I guess first and foremost, that was the main driver. It was both new clients. It was also utilization rates increased. And as you know, what we have been doing over the last three or four years is, it's been broadly going after private equity in technology but also in non-technology. And we just saw deal activity in the first quarter actually be stronger than even we expected.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes, I think that covers it, Greg I have nothing to add.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. And then in terms of customers adjusting cash burn which came up a couple of times, how widespread is that currently within your customer base?", "Greg Becker", "So Steve, it's Greg again. I guess there's two ways to look at it. One is what we're hearing when we talk to the venture capitalist. And as you know, we spend -- we probably had more interactions with venture capitalists than anybody else. And obviously, in the first quarter, we talk to them a lot about, what is their outlook and what advice are they giving to their companies? And a lot of that advice came back that we're hearing, it is focused on lowering cash burn, get to profitability, try to raise capital so you really don't have to go to the market, if you have to, for 12 to 18 months and so we're hearing that pretty consistently.", "Now, some companies that are truly -- they're doing so well they really don't have to worry a whole lot about fundraising or valuations. We're not really seeing a major change. But then you look at our operations and our flows of dollars. We're starting to actually see it a little bit. I would expect that to continue to happen in Q2. So it is real and it is pretty broad based from the standpoint of what people are doing and how they are operating in this environment.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. And Greg, related to that, when we think of inflows into deposits, we think of new clients. Right? And you mentioned 1000 new company clients this quarter which is really not that far off. Am I missing something? Or has the new company formation trends really have not declined by that much yet?", "Greg Becker", "They haven't changed a whole lot, Steve. I'd say if you look back over the last three or four quarters, our high water mark, on a quarterly basis, was just under 1300. So from that high water mark, you've definitely seen a noticeable difference. But it was a little low in the first quarter, then it ramped up in the second quarter and then it trickled down. But I agree with you.", "When you look at the new client additions, it's really not that far off and my crystal ball would say it is going to be in that range for the next several quarters. And part of that is driven by the fact that you are seeing a decrease in that early-stage funding, number one and new Company investments. But it's also, on the positive side, driven by the fact that we now have a bigger footprint, right? We have a bigger footprint in the UK. We have a bigger footprint in the U.S.. We have more feet on the street and that helps us.", "So there's a positive side with our ability to bring in new clients despite the market, but it's also -- has a little bit of a headwind by the fact that there's less funding going into that early-stage, as well.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "When you look at the early-stage book can you tell us what done with the reserves on early-stage has that been increasing over the quarter as well and where do they stand now compared to the balances?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Sure so this is Mark. So we have seen I think we alluded to at the distress in the early-stage we have seen an increase in criticized early-stage loan. And with the increase in criticized comes higher level of formula reserves.", "Jared Shaw", "And when you look at the increase in the criticized, are you just saying since there's stress and the whole lifecycle we're going to make more of a methodological change to the evaluation of these loan services on a loan by month basis we're actually saying more of the migration criticized.", "Michael Descheneaux", "So we have seen am I correct duration into criticized which is the first thing. As far as the methodology change, no. We continue to have the same loan methodology for early-stage we always had. Again the migration criticized comes higher level formula reserve.", "Greg Becker", "Jared, what I would add on to that is what Mike tried to do in his opening comments is a couple things. One is we reiterated our expectations for net charge-offs in that 30 to 50 basis point range more toward the higher end of that and that will be driven by early-stage, that\u2019s hoping to give a guy more context. And the second part is he also commented the fact that if you look at the first quarter from provision perspective and you then look at that number $33 million you could say that the next three quarters our view would be in that range although he was very clear to point out that obviously it wouldn't be that streamlined to each quarter it ends up being that but I think on average that's really what we expect to see and preponderance of that higher level of provision from what we've seen over the 2015 relates to early-stage.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay. And then as you look at your markets and especially the international markets maybe outside of London are you seeing any greater weakness in those secondary tech markets? Or is it pretty similar throughout the footprint?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg again. It is pretty similar. We have had very strong growth strong numbers in the UK as I mentioned in my comments. We have seen good new client acquisition in Asia. So it's pretty consistent across all the markets.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zerbe", "I guess probably a question for Mike. In terms of the NCO [ph] guidance they gave the 30 to 50 right, you're going to be at the high end of that range, but this quarter you were 49. I guess I'm just wondering what's the thought process because if you are already at the very high end of the range it kind of implies your losses on average around here maybe a little lower. But I guess the concern the market has this the loss continue to take higher. Can you just help us understand like why not raise the range or what are you seeing that may keep that sort of within that range? Thanks.", "Marc Cadieux", "So it's Marc, I'll take this one. While at the 49 basis points for the first quarter important to point out two things that were true about the first quarter experience. The first is that we have one larger loan which unlike the fourth quarter which was entirely early-stage, this one large loan was almost a third of the charge-offs for the quarter. So that would be the first thing. And then the second thing is there was one larger early-stage loan in the population of early-stage charge-offs in the first quarter. Those two things together I think skew the first quarter relatively speaking from what normal or normal for 2016 might look like.", "Ken Zerbe", "Okay. And then just the other question was in terms of -- I think you guys mentioned about deposit outflows was corporate finance clients taking advantage of higher grades elsewhere. Did that happen throughout the quarter? Was there any big lumpiness? I'm trying to figure out A, how meaningful was that particular case and are we done with that batch of outflows so to speak?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I will start and Mike may want to add if you look at the mix of total client funds we actually continued to see strong numbers at that kind of early mid-stage. When you got to the gross stage and later to include corporate finance and private equity services that\u2019s actually where you saw the outflow of deposits. And it's for different reasons. The one reason you'd see in the later stage companies that were acquired that actually happened to have fairly sizable balances on the balance sheet, number one.", "Number two you had some of the corporate finance clients that we had that actually made acquisitions and took excess cash to actually make the acquisition and so it declined from that. The third one is you had distributions which means you had a lot of gains by some of the private equity firms and venture capital firms but then they paid out to limited partners as distribution. So it was a combination of those things that really drove the change in total client funds.", "Now your second question is which we think is going to happen? Again there's two parts to that. On the early-stage if the early-stage slows down more you could see some pressure or some slowness in that area again but we didn't see that in the first quarter. And we don't know yet on the corporate finance side if what the behavior I described either acquisitions going on and companies using up excess cash or companies getting acquired is going to make a meaningful dent. When I made that comment is there are some potential areas of headwinds but there's also positive signs in a sense of burn rates are coming down. Companies are focused more on profitability and again we have done a good job of new client acquisition. So that's kind of the whole context, whole picture when we think about the outlook for deposits in total clients funds.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "So I guess first question just in terms of if you can talk about the competitive landscape both from a lending and deposit side. I guess given what's happened in the last 6, 9 months, how has that impacted in terms of maybe increased opportunities on the lending side and likewise from a customer acquisition standpoint how you see some of the fringe players pull back, has created more opportunities?", "Greg Becker", "When I think of the competitive landscape we have been saying for as you know the last several quarters that higher valuations and just activity levels we're paying more attention to where we want to lend, where we don't want to lend and what risk profile we want to take. We have seen over the last quarter or two that we have looked at certain business models, some in the consumer area and a few other ones that we\u2019re just a little more cautious on because of the environment for fundraising and what's happening.", "What we have been surprised by I would say I have been surprised by that the competitive landscape I guess hasn't got a memo that things have changed a little bit. And from that standpoint we're still saying very aggressive terms and it's interesting not only aggressive terms and structure but aggressive terms on pricing. So we're still winning strong amount of new clients. But we\u2019re also I would say probably losing more and it's not that there aren't opportunities it's more because we have chosen not to step up to the terms that others are willing to provide in the market.", "Michael Descheneaux", "I think the only thing I would add there would Ebrahim, is that the demand is clearly there. But the demand sort of falls into maybe three broad buckets. It's refinancing debt taken on over the last couple years that we would look at say that's just too much debt in environment level on this one or it would be companies seeking debt in order to postpone their day of reckoning perhaps where it's a Company that's overvalued and those that might be facing a down route if they were to raise again. And then there's the last grouping of what I'll call quality opportunities and it's the quality opportunities that I think as Greg noted I too have been surprised at just how remarkably competitive it's been for that subset.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "I guess on the second question and I appreciate you all not wanting to give a guidance on the warrant or securities gains. Is there action in the public market when we see sort of recovering the stock markets and sort of IPOs coming back recently, is that a good cross feed into what -- how the behavior of your warrant and securities gain might be or is it to detach from what's happening in the private markets and we shouldn't read into that signal of potential improvement for you?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Obviously I think any improving public markets are actually very good for our clients, our warrant portfolios, our investment portfolios. I mean certainly in terms of valuation and certainly in terms of M&A exists or if the IPO markets return. So yes if you start to see a buying of that or improvement on that then we could intentionally see some improvements in the warrant gains and investment gains. And as you have clearly seen Q1 was just a dire quarter. It just was very limited M&A and certainly just no IPOs really to recognize but again things can change quickly. We all know that and we do have a lot of warrants. We have warrants in some 1600 companies so all it takes a handful of M&A activities, and then you're right back on to having some interesting gains and similarly on the investment side as well.", "Greg Becker", "The only thing I would add on to it is the added upside is that in the investment portfolio we have certain amount of investments that are held at cost from an accounting perspective and obviously the market value is still even if it pulls back a little bit is still roughly $100 million of valuation difference and so it's those companies sell as those companies or those funds become liquid even more depressed market there's still more upside. But when are those going to happen and what's the timing, as you know that's why we don't give guidance on a quarterly basis because it's really too difficult to predict.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Joe Morford from RBC Capital. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford", "I guess my first question was just a follow-up to that last one. Marc, did you say you are saying more companies turn to the bank for financing their growth as opposed to say doing a down round and so you suggest that's kind of business that you are leery of taking on it at this point?", "Marc Cadieux", "So I'm going to break that question into two pieces, Joe. I think there is potentially demand for assistance with financing growth, right. Working capital financing but that would probably be in the bucket that has been more in the hypercompetitive. And then there's the second category were I'd say it's not necessarily to finance growth it's debt to avoid equity. And it's that second category where again they are looking for a large leg of debt to replace the equity financing that probably is the right answer for the Company but they don't want to go there because of valuation or other reasons that we're particularly leery of.", "Joe Morford", "And then I guess Mike you mentioned the payments and credit card fees were up 26% year over year. What's been the biggest driver to that activity and how do you see that growth rate kind of going forward?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So I will go ahead start and Greg will probably add on to it. I mean certainly the credit card aspect of it has been a key driver and as we've talked before there as in terms of developing a broader payment strategy just taking advantage of payments from Point A to Point B. So again we continue to implement that strategy and in terms of growth we do provide the guidance on the core fee income outlook and so you do have our outlook for that as well to. Those are primarily driven by FX and credit card fees as well.", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg I would just add on to it. It starts with just additional penetration of the product on the credit cards, that's one area that's driving growth. But as you know we\u2019ve talked about this a lot, the business we're trying to connect more with our clients and be a value added payment partner in the pay site so we\u2019re using virtual cards B2B payments where more companies can use virtual cards to pay not just travel and entertainment but actually to make their payments on their vendor payments and when you are running that through the volumes are obviously much, much bigger than travel and entertainment. So those things can drive very nice growth and we expect that to be a key driver of our growth on a go forward basis which is why our outlook remains where it is in the mid-20s.", "Joe Morford", "And then lastly Mike do you anticipate doing additional sales of securities to help support the loan growth and liquidity?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Joe, obviously if we need to we certainly well, right? It's all about matching your maturity from your investment securities portfolio. So for example, each quarter we have maturities about $800 million per quarter in terms of investment securities portfolio and you saw obviously this past quarter we grew loans over a $1 billion around a $1 billion at least in the period numbers. So just really depends on the inflows and deposits and the loan growth and so that just dictates whether or not we need to sell. But again healthy liquidity, healthy amount of maturities which generally would hopefully we wouldn't have to sell.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Deer", "Following up on Joe's question with the credit card business. Given the growth that you're seeing and projecting in the payments and that API, would it make sense to break that out in the individual line item because it would be nice for us to get a better sense of just how that's performing independently?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg, I'll start. So you know right now as you know we lump it together. That is something that we may want to do in the future. It's not big enough yet to really justify because you're going to see potentially some fluctuations on a quarterly basis. So you really want to get to -- it becomes more meaningful. Do I think that will happen in the next 12 months, 18 months? Yes I could see it happening maybe as we consider it looking at the volumes and what numbers it would be and what the forecast is possibly in 2017 or 2018", "Aaron Deer", "And then going back to the reserve and credit. I'm curious on new loan fundings what kind of reserves do you establish on the various loan types. For example, what's the reserve on a new loan for early-stage companies versus those for capital call lines?", "Marc Cadieux", "Generally the reserve that's assigned in our model will be a function of the category. So as you mentioned private equity services versus early stage and the credit risk ratings and so considering that our loans are originated at a risk rating of pass meaning expectation that everything is going to be great, you would have reserves that would be plus or minus 1% of the funded balance might be lower for private equity services where the probability of migrating to criticize are nonperforming or charge-off is far, far less, might be higher for the early-stage. But generally they are plus or minus 1% at the pass rating and then depending on the category moving up as they migrate or if they migrate into criticized or worse risk rating.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Matthew Keating from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matthew Keating", "I was hoping you could review obviously venture capital fundraising activity was pretty healthy in the first quarter, I think around $13 billion was raised relative to about $28 billion in all of the last year. Could you comment maybe the historical relationship between VC fundraising activity and then venture capital actual financing activity and then maybe related exits, is there any relationship there or is that more of a lagging indicator on the fundraising side. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "There is a correlation between the two but as far as how long that, what it takes to deploy that capital is very different. It's kind of venture capital fund, it is -- what their investment horizon is and it's what they see from opportunities perspective. So you could see venture funds that deploy their funds in 24 months but you can also see funds that really they are raising large funds and the whole point is to create diversification for that fund and then maybe over three, four, or even five years and then they keep a certain level of reserve so this Company needs funds over even a six, seven, eight year period they have capacity to support those companies.", "So it's a great indication of how limited partners look at the venture capital market that $13 billion has raised in the first quarter but you can't extrapolate that and say then if you raise that in the first quarter that means, second, third, and fourth quarter are going to be very, very strong. In addition to that you have to look at what's changed over the last two, three, four, five years which that is that it's venture capital, it's as important as it is and it's very important.", "There are other sources of capital in the market and so watching how that behaves is going to be what we\u2019re paying attention. And just kind of a separate note to that we spent some time with some of the larger visual mutual funds out there that have gotten into the market and kind of gotten their perspective and wondering if they're going to pull back and how far they will pull back if they are. And what we have heard directly from them is that yes they don't like written down some of the investments they have made over the last couple of years but they believe because of these companies state private longer they have to play in the late stage private market. So we believe they are going to continue to invest in this market over the coming years and that is a good sign for us and a good sign for our clients.", "Matthew Keating", "I guess more on the later stage aspect of the market. What percentage of your business is related to these unicorns, these billion dollars private market valuation companies. Is that a major factor in your business or not so much in your opinion?", "Greg Becker", "It's not a major part of our business. Clearly we have some unicorns in the portfolio but we don't actually lend that much to them in fact I would argue very little part of that it's because as we said in prior calls a lot of times we have competed over the last few years with equity so when you've raised hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars does it really make sense even if it's an attractive rate to basically borrow money and the answer has been for the most part no. We do have some deposits and some total client funds but I would argue from my standpoint it's not a material number.", "Matthew Keating", "And then -- so [indiscernible] capital call lending this quarter, the rest of the portfolio's loan growth was a little bit more moderate. What can be done -- is there anything that can be done to accelerate that growth? Do you\u2019ve any strategic initiatives at play to drive more early-stage lending growth or is that really just a function of the market right not being as vibrant as it has been over the past couple of years.", "Greg Becker", "As you look at the loan growth excluding equity services was exceptionally strong and the private bank which is also very strong. There were some growth in other parts of the portfolio. Life sciences for example had some growth. What we saw in the first quarter again is you're seeing some companies that have come to the realization that their business models don't work and some of those loans are actually getting repaid when they say we have got excess cash, it doesn't make sense, it's going to be hard for us to raise that next round of financing let's pay down that loan. You have other companies that could raise money. They really -- a lot of people try to get those fund replenished as quickly as possible and they still have 12 to 18 months' worth of capital. That being said at least there is an opportunity is still in that mid and later stage as competitive as it is, we clearly believe we have a competitive differentiation and we believe that we're going to be able to grow the book of business over the course of the year although again it's very competitive.", "Operator", "[Microphone Inaccessible].", "Unidentified Analyst", "The remaining question I have is regarding the net interest margin. Maybe Mike you can answer this. You talked about the loan yield and it had an eight basis point benefit from the fed rate hike in December but then there was an offset from a decline in loan fees of seven basis points. My question is what is the absolute impact of the loan fees and then how does the first quarter compared to what you think may happen for the rest of 2016?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So the loan fees affect the loan yields from the prepayments does vary quarter to quarter. So just depends on if certain loans are pre-paying early and then we can accelerate the re-collection of the fees. So again admittedly it's up and down every single quarter by anywhere from $2 million to $4 million on average in a given quarter. So there's no really way to predict that it's just behavior in terms of growth in loans and when somebody decides to repay a loan early. So but again like I said generally it moves up and down around between $2 million and $4 million a quarter.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And did you disclose what the absolute dollar amount was here in the first quarter?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No but you can keep an eye on, so if you actually go to the press release there's a disclosure about -- in the footnotes back there on the income statement that talk about the loan fees that we're recognizing each quarter so you can actually pull that out from there.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just one more from me. I believe the question was asked earlier but I think I missed the answer if you gave it. Can you tell us what the current reserve on the early stage portfolio is at this point?", "Greg Becker", "Yes we didn't actually we didn't in the earlier question and will now breakout the portion of the loan loss reserve that's allocated to early stage. But would repeat the answer to the early question that it has trended up at the level of criticized early-stage loans have trended up.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Brett Rabatin", "Just wanted to ask you gave range guidance towards higher low-end for some of the line items but not on the margin and was just curious kind of given where the margin is and what's going on with the balance sheet any thoughts on why you wouldn't talk about the margin guidance being at the higher end of the range or maybe changing that this quarter?", "Greg Becker", "Obviously we feel comfortable with the margin in that. I mean certainly the rate increase that we had in December's it's very helpful. The things you've got to think about is what could change that going forward and you know certainly loan mix or as we continue to grow loans that's going to have a positive impact on them because by and large the loans we\u2019re issuing are larger than our net interest margin. So that's why we feel comfortable with our range that we have outlook. With respect to deposits, whether those are coming in lower or faster pace certainly does affect it but again not a significant amount at least at this stage.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay it just seems like you might be at the high end or maybe higher potentially at some point this year.", "Greg Becker", "Well let's hope so. We are always hopeful for an increase in net interest margin.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Juliana Balicka from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Juliana Balicka", "I wanted to ask a little more about your investment fundings. You\u2019ve been in some of these funds for coming up on a decade now. So shouldn't some of these fund be in kind of harvesting stage, for example your managed funds which are still holding onto public securities. Is there any kind of [indiscernible] when you're going to sell this securities and get you out of strategic another investments conservative positively to gains [indiscernible] warrants contributed positively. So is there any way to think about a kind of a curve of when you will start to exit?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Obviously I think over time they will begin to exit but they will look to markets that are more calm, as we all know in Q1 it was very anxious market. If the markets do come then perhaps you would start to see them beginning to exit out of some of these positions. Now you also have to think about some of these public companies that they are holding positions in are subject to lock-ups, right, that also can delay. But at the end of the day as you know the partners of those funds will decide when is the opportune time to exit out of those markets. But yes overtime over the next couple years since some of these funds have been around for a long time, we should start to be seeing exits as long as there's M&A activity and the economy market holds and as Greg pointed out a fair amount of these investments we have are held at the cost basis and so we certainly look to the, when they do exit because that would certainly potentially generate some nice gains for us.", "Juliana Balicka", "Okay and then maybe switching to the early-stage credit cycle as you talked about that being within expectations. In terms of thinking about how long a credit cycle might last early-stage loans, it seems to me that these companies are going to fail, they are going to fail, they are going to fail very quickly. So what else I would say more established industries like oil rates can drag on for seemingly forever. It would seem that credit situation [indiscernible] should come fairly quickly and by let's say I don\u2019t mid-2017, you would almost be resetting or how do we can think about the duration of potential credit stress?", "Greg Becker", "You are right it actually is -- it happens in the near term. The only caveat I would here is that companies have longer funding maybe 12 months 18 months with a cash as opposed to the companies we\u2019re running on nine months of cash collective on average and all of a sudden then you've got to make a decision very quickly or you'll find very quickly where the stress actually is. So we kind of see that over the course of 2016 a lot of this is going to play out and it could actually be even earlier than that. So as Mike described in his comments that we expect the first quarter provision to repeat itself. Q2, Q3, Q4 again on an average but it may be volatile from quarter to quarter. That's kind of our best view of what we would expect to play out early-stage and then decrease and start to improve once the market settles down and as you said some of these companies will have played out already.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore.", "John Pancari", "I just want to ask about the loan yield impact from the fed hike. You indicated that you saw about an eight basis point benefit to loan yields from the 25 basis point fed hike in December, that feels light especially given your 88% variable loan composition. So can you give me a little more color on -- is there anything that impacted that 8 basis points where possibly it could the greater in future hikes.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Roughly about 80% of our loans are tied to variable rates. There a few things to consider when you think about the number whether it's light or not, first off is part of the increase of the loan yields actually happened affect in December. There was a little bit of that -- perhaps one of the larger things to consider would be the fact that we have LIBOR based loans as well too. So if you look at the LIBOR rates, one month LIBOR is around 43, 44 basis points, so not quite up to the 50 basis points. So there's a little bit of not quite the full impact of that plus you also saw in December that LIBOR rates are starting to increase even before the feds started increase. So there was some of that pickup as well too and perhaps the final point is look it still takes some time for some of these loans to reset whether it's on a 30 day LIBOR or 90 day LIBOR as well, so that would I think account for the difference. But by and large when you see a 25 basis point rise assuming LIBOR is going to move in conjunction, you\u2019re going to see approximately 75% to 80% of us kind of that falling to the loan yields.", "John Pancari", "Okay. So you think that 8 basis points is relatively representative of the move you'll get if you get another 25 base point hike later on this year?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No. I think what I am saying is just in the core of the 8 basis point is reflective of again some of the yield increases we saw in December, some of the pre-run up with respect to LIBOR, some of the things related to LIBOR and some of our clients are still resetting over the time here and the fact that right now there still is the different LIBOR again one month LIBOR is only at 43 basis points, so not quite the full 50.", "John Pancari", "And then separately on the lower loan fees I guess you answered it earlier they tend to be volatile. Do you have any visibility into the next quarter about how that's trending?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No again when you look at the low fee income we had in Q1, it was $25 million. If you compare that to Q4 it was $27 million, so there was a decline of $2 million by and large it's primarily driven by the prepayment fees from early loan repayments. And again if you go back and map it out and do some of that benchmark and look at it you\u2019re going to see movement anywhere $2 million, $3 million, $4 million in a given quarter run-rate but again it's very difficult to predict because I just can't predict when somebody is going to repay a loan.", "Operator", "This concludes the Q&A session. I'll now turn the call back over to CEO, Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you. Thank you everyone for joining us today. We look at the first quarter we delivered a solid quarter in terms of the core numbers. Clearly as you heard on the call we spent a lot of time talking about where we saw some stress and expect to see a little pressure in the early-stage loan portfolio and some headwinds in our investment, security portfolio and warrants. That being said, we did spend a lot of time and I hope that came through that we're comfortable with the outlook, comfortable with our ability to manage it and maybe as important or more important we're still looking at the long term and what we can do to invest for the long term to grow our business and support our clients.", "So with that I want to thank our clients for their support of us, our ability to support them and all our employees and our investors and the analysts for joining us today.

My name is Anna and I will be your operator for today's call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I will now turn now the call over to Meghan O'Leary, please go ahead.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you Anna, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and CFO, Mike Descheneaux are here to talk about our second quarter 2016 financial results, and they will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We'll be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call. In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures, information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thank you, Meghan and thanks all of you for joining us today. We delivered another solid quarter despite global market volatility in quite exit markets with earnings per share of $1.78 and net income of $93 million. Our results were marked by continued strong long growth, improved PEVC related gains relative to Q1, and credit quality within our expectations.", "We believe uncertainty will continue to weigh on the markets overall but as you can see from our outlook, we currently expect solid performance in the business for the remainder of 2016. Overall, we are positive about our opportunities as we move into the second half of 2016 and beyond assuming the continued stability in the broader market. Mike will cover the numbers in detail while I will address what we're seeing in the macro environment, the implications for us, and our strategy to capitalize on the environment now, and in the long-term.", "Let's start with the macro environment. Obviously, the big event during the quarter was Brexit which created fears of a dampened global economy leading to a flattening of the yield curve in vanishing prospects for a rate increase. This weighs on the markets overall creating uncertainty and restraining investment and exits. Closer to the innovation space, the venture capital and technology markets remain mixed in Q2 although there were some bright spots. VC fund raising was lower in Q2 but still strong with limited partners committing near $9 billion to larger funds, and high performing firms with established general partners. We view this as good news for the quarters to come.", "VC investment will also help the overall. But the solid dollar figures were dominated by a small number of very large rounds to late-stage private companies. At the same time funding to early stage startups declined as investors opted to put their money where they perceive momentum, and staying power. VC-backed exits were only marginally better in the second quarter. Concern over late-stage valuations and uncertainty in the markets continue to weigh on IPO prospects. There were 12 venture-backed IPO in the U.S. in Q2, only three of them Tech although all performed well. This was an improvement over zero tech IPOs in the prior quarter. The number of VC-backed M&A transactions was down notably in the second quarter although the average dollar amount per deal increased significantly. Despite this trend of fewer transactions, there is a broad expectation of market volatility and a lack of incentive for private companies to go public could lead to higher levels of M&A in the coming quarters. ", "Let me talk about the impact on SVB. Although our results during the quarter were positive, these market dynamics continue to affect SVB primarily in three areas; slower total client funds flows, some stress with early-stage loans, and lower warrant gains. Total client funds which include on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client fund investments have decreased. Deposits decreased primarily due more challenging fund raising environment. In addition, our ongoing efforts to direct clients toward appropriate off-balance sheet products resulted in nearly $2 billion of funds flowing from deposits to off-balance sheet products in Q2.", "On the client investment fund side, M&A among our clients has been the primary factor behind slower growth accounting for $2.3 billion of total client fund flows \u2013 outflows year-to-date although that activity has been good for loan balances and credit quality. Trade-offs [ph] remained elevated due to continued softness in early-stage venture funding although our overall credit performance was within our expectations and outlook range. And market factors have also contributed to lower gains on PE and VC-related investment securities and warrants, despite some improvement in the second quarter.", "Why we're optimistic? So we have some near-term challenges that could persist for a few more quarters but we believe they are manageable. We were seeing many positive signs and opportunities despite these challenges. So I want to tell you why we're optimistic about the rest of 2016. First, our clients are doing well overall; second, we're winning new clients at a very healthy pace; third, we're building strategic partnerships to support expansion of our payments and digital efforts; and fourth, we continue to build a platform that will support our long-term growth within the innovation economy.", "Starting with clients; they have always been resilient. Our client base as a whole is performing well even while adapting to the more challenging fund raising an exit markets. Secondly, we're seeing signs of potential pick up in M&A activity with growth -- growing confidence among our private equity clients, who are actively looking for good companies and have capital to deploy. Likewise, a growing number of our corporate clients have told us they plan to focus actively on acquisition opportunities, and we've seen evidence of this in greater openness among these clients to conversations about debt financing. And third, although the IPO market is barely moving we've seen a marked increase in the pipeline for secondary public offerings among our clients. The number of active fillings nearly doubled in the second quarter compared to the first which bodes well for future growth and liquidity.", "The second area I'm feeling positive about is our ability to win new clients and build relationships in promising markets. Our pace of new client acquisition remained strong, we on-boarded more than 1,100 new corporate clients in the second quarter including 85 new clients to our partnership which we announced just last quarter. We're investing in people to take advantage of incremental growth and opportunities and promising markets here in the U.S. which in the second quarter included hiring in Silicon Valley, Los Angelis, Boston and New York. We continue to build relationships and expand our ability to serve entrepreneurs globally. We have grown our global client count at double-digit rates over the past two years and grew average global loan balances by nearly 20% in the second quarter, mostly in the UK. We still see plenty of opportunity in the UK and Europe despite the uncertainty created by Brexit. We also established our presence in Dublin, Ireland earlier this year.", "The third area I'm excited about is our focus on leveraging strategic partnerships to offer scalable and sustainable payment solutions to our clients, at every stage of their life cycle. In June we announced an expansion of our card processing relationship with first data to leverage their industry leading borderless commerce solutions. This puts us on the path to being able to support the largest E-commerce companies by offering our clients the ability to accept and make payments globally, cross borders and platforms in the scale this capability as they grow. Our pipeline E-commerce opportunities has grown substantially since this announcement. We continue to work with a variety of partners including Master Card, to create flexible scalable payment solutions that not only make it easy for all our clients to run their business, but allows us to provide complex Payment backbone solutions to our Fintech client as part of our banking infrastructure, as a service offering. ", "And although we're always building for the future, we've seen significant benefits from our investment today but it's that we expect will grow overtime. For example, despite a slight decrease in the quarter, year-to-date we've seen healthy increases in our card business relative to 2015 with a 20% increase in the number of active cards and an 18% increase in card revenue. We saw similar healthy growth of 27% in foreign exchange revenue during the same period due to our efforts to strengthen our client relationships and the client experience, as well as market volatility. Fourth and finally, we continue to expand our platform reaching capabilities to support our long-term growth within the innovation economy.", "We continue to focus on pride -- providing the best experience possible to our private bank clients. This includes offering enhanced products and advice, customized to the needs of innovators, executive, entrepreneurs and influencers in an innovation economy, and providing a differentiated client experience in keeping with our high aspirations for that business.", "Secondly, we're expanding our capabilities in life science practice, providing advisory services to help large corporates work with our clients to identify appropriate partnerships domestically and internationally. Also in life sciences, we continue to see growth at the early stage through partnerships with leading accelerators that support young and developing companies. We're also creating growth opportunities across the spectrum of mid- to later-stage companies with financing structures that help bridge to important milestones and large syndicated credits for leading private and public life science, healthcare and digital health companies. We see these milestones, improvements and initiatives as reasons to be positive about 2016 and beyond. Our fundamental business remains strong and although we may continue to see the effects of the VC market recalibration and global market angst for a few more quarters, we believe these impacts will be manageable and temporary. ", "In the meantime, we remain focused on expanding our platform capabilities to support our growth, retaining the best employees, working with the best clients in our industries and leveraging our unique platform to deliver value to those clients. This focus has helped us maintain our growth momentum over the long term, and we expect to help drive future growth as we move forward. We will continue to monitor our clients and market conditions, be we remain firm in our belief that innovation space offers tremendous opportunities in the long term and remains the best possible place for us to be.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon, everyone. Our solid results in the second quarter were driven by outstanding loan growth, better PE and VC-related gains and stable credit quality. It is important to note that our results also reflect a $12.4 million pre-tax gain on the sale of investment securities to support our loan growth. ", "Today, I would like to highlight the following items; first, significant loan growth driven by private equity capital call lines; second, a decline in on-balance sheet deposits, primarily as a result of tempered VC investment levels and exits; third, slightly higher net interest income and a higher net interest margin; fourth, stable overall credit quality, within our expectations, given the environment; fifth, somewhat better PE/VC-related investment securities and warrant gains, albeit down from 2015 levels; sixth, core fee income comparable to Q1; seventh, lower expenses as a result of lower compensation costs; and finally, increased capital leverage ratios due to lower assets driven by the decline in deposits.", "We will also be making a few adjustments to our outlook. Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $1.2 billion, or 7%, to $18.2 billion, driven primarily by continued growth in private equity capital call lines, although approximately $300 million of second quarter loan growth came from other loan categories. As a result of our continued strong loan growth, we are increasing our full-year percentage loan growth outlook from the low 20s to the mid-20s.", "Now let us move to total client funds, consisting of on-balance-sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds. Average total client funds decreased by $700 million, or less than 1%, to $81 billion, reflecting a decline of $1.1 billion or 2.8% in average on-balance-sheet deposits, partially offset by a $400 million increase in average balance sheet client investment funds.", "As Greg mentioned, the funding environment and a slow IPO market were the key drivers of lower on-balance-sheet deposits during the quarter. An increase in M&A by, and of, our growth and corporate finance-stage clients slowed growth in our off-balance-sheet investment funds. This was offset by strong new client acquisition and inflows from early-stage and private equity clients related to our successful efforts to encourage clients to use the appropriate off-balance-sheet products. Despite the impact of current market trends on deposit slows, our client funds franchise remained healthy and we have ample access to liquidity. In light of the decline in deposits over the past two quarters, we believe our full year 2016 deposit growth will be slower than we originally expected and, as a result, we are reducing our deposit percentage growth outlook from the low double-digits to the mid-single digits.", "Turning to net interest income and our net interest margin; net interest income increased by $1.9 million to $283.6 million in the second quarter due to loan growth, although the impact was largely offset by the sale of investment securities to fund loan growth. Nevertheless, the impact of strong loan growth means that we are maintaining our full-year 2016 outlook for net interest income growth. Interest income from loans increased by $7.3 million due to higher average loan balances. Overall, loan yields decreased by 14 basis points, primarily due to growth in lower-yielding capital call lines which accounted for 8 basis points and $1.2 million decline in loan fees driven by lower fees from early loan pay-offs in the second quarter. Interest income from investment securities declined by $4.5 million, primarily due to lower average balances from the sale of securities. At the same time, overall investment security yields increased by 3 basis points to 1.62%.", "Average fixed income security balances decreased by approximately $1.6 billion to $21.8 billion, due to the sale of $1 billion of U.S. Treasury Securities to fund our loan growth and $600 million related to pay-downs and maturities. I would also like to call your attention to an increase in our short-term borrowings of $500 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank, which we used at the tail end of the quarter to support our loan growth. As a result of our strong loan growth, our net interest margin increased by 6 basis points, to 2.73%. Because of this, we are raising our full year 2016 net interest margin outlook range by 10 basis points to between 2.6% and 2.8%. ", "Now let us move to credit quality which remained stable overall and within our expectations, given the environment. As we expected, the slower pace of early-stage funding relative to 2015 and broader market conditions continued to weigh on early-stage credit quality in the second quarter. However, it is important to note that our early-stage portfolio is only about 6% of our total loans. The rest of our portfolio performed well overall. Our allowance for loan losses was $244.7 million at the end of the second quarter, an increase of $14.5 million, but remained stable overall, at 1.29% of total gross loans. Our allowance for loan losses for performing loans as a percentage of total gross performing loans decreased 3 basis points to 0.98% at June 30. The overall increase in the allowance was primarily reflective of the $1.1 billion growth in period-end loan balances as well as increases in specific reserves for non-accrual loans. These increases were offset by a decrease in the reserves for our performing loans, which reflects the continuing shift in the mix of the loan portfolio to our private equity venture capital loan portfolio.", "Our loan loss provision was $36.3 million in the second quarter, compared to $33.3 million in the prior quarter. This amount reflects approximately $15.4 million in reserves for new non-accrual loans, $13 million for charge-offs that did not previously have a specific reserve, and $10.7 million for loan growth, offset by a decrease in the reserves for performing loans. We indicated in April that we expected quarterly provision levels for 2016 to remain at or near Q1 levels on an average due to current credit conditions. The provision, as it relates to credit quality, was higher than expected due to strong loan growth during the quarter, which contributed to a somewhat higher dollar amount overall. The allowance for loan losses for non-performing loans increased by $9.5 million to $59.9 million, reflecting the $15.4 million in reserves for new non-performing loans, which I mentioned earlier, and which was partially offset by charge-offs of previously reserved non-accrual loans.", "Net charge-offs were $19.4 million, or 43 basis points, compared to $20.7 million or 50 basis points in the first quarter. This reflects $20.7 million in gross charge-offs compared to $26.2 million in the first quarter. 65% of charge-offs came from 11 early-stage software Internet loans. Additionally, we had one charge-off of $5.2 million from a later-stage digital media company. Non-performing allowance increased by $10.8 million to $124.7 million or 66 basis points compared to 64 basis points in the prior quarter. The increase was driven by $33.5 million of new non-accrual loans, primarily from the addition of one new sponsor buyout loan in the second quarter in the healthcare services space. The increase was partially offset by repayments of $16.8 million and charged us $5.5 million. Subsequent to quarter end and as a result not reflected in the non-performing loan amount as of June 30, we also received repayment of a $9.6 million non-performing software loan in the mobile and telecom infrastructure space. With respect to our outlook, we are maintaining our credit quality outlook for the full year 2016.", "Now let us move to non-interest income which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from once and from investment securities. I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details. GAAP non-interest income was $112.8 million compared to $86.1 million in the first quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interests was $111.2 million compared to $88.8 million in the first quarter. The increase compared to the first quarter was driven primarily by non-GAAP net gains on investment securities net off non-controlling interest of $21.6 million compared to net losses of $2 million in the prior quarter. This reflects gains of approximately $12.4 million from the sale of $1 billion in U.S. Treasury securities which I mentioned earlier and $9.6 million of gains from our PE and VC-related investments, primarily due to fund distributions and some improvements in certain public company valuations during the quarter. ", "Gains on warrants were $5.1 million compared to $6.6 million in the prior quarter. This primarily reflects valuation increases of $7.4 million. The increase was offset somewhat by $2.3 million of losses mainly related to warrant exercises at prices below our estimated fair value. We expect that the recalibration of the VC market and lack of visibility to potential exits may continue to drive lower and fewer funding rounds and tempered gains on warrant on PE and VC related investments. Core fee income was $74.5 million, a slight decrease from $76.5 million in the first quarter. This change was driven primarily by decrease in foreign exchange fees. As a reminder core fee income includes foreign exchange, credit cards, better credits, deposit service charges, lending related fees and client investment fees. ", "Foreign exchange income was $24.1 million, down $2.9 million due to onetime reclassification in the first quarter, fees that were previously reflected in gains and losses on derivative instruments. Year-to-date, foreign exchange income is up 27% over the same period in 2015. Credit card and payment fees were flat at $15.4 million in the second quarter primarily due to reduced interchanged volume related to lower spending on our business credit cards by some clients as a result of the slower pace of our early stage investments and clients adjusting spend rates. Nevertheless, year-to-date credit card and payment fees are up 18% over 2015. Our fee income lines are performing solidly and we expect strong growth in foreign exchange and cards and payment fees over the long-term. Although, we are decreasing our 2016 outlook for core fee income growth from the mid-20s to the low-20s, the nominal after-tax dollar difference is relatively small at approximately $5 million.", "I would like to note that we still expect growth in card and payment fees in the second half of the year. The decrease in our outlook was driven by the near term impact of our lower average spend by our business credit card users, lower foreign exchange transaction sizes and lower off balance sheet climb investment sizes, all somewhat impacted by the overarching effects of the current VC funding and exit markets. If the investment environments, exit markets, broader economy improve faster than expected, we could see upside moving onto expenses, non-interest expense decreased by $3.6 million to $200.4 million. The primary driver of the decrease was a $6.7 million decrease in overall compensation expense which consists primarily of the following components; a $4.3 million decrease in incentive compensation expense, related to our current expectations for our full year performance relative to our internal targets.", "A decrease of $3.3 million and other compensation expenses attributable primarily to the seasonal increase in the first quarter from additional 401(k) matching expense and employer payroll taxes related to our 2015 incentive compensation plan payments, as well as lower share based compensation and a 1 million increase in salaries due to an increase in employees in Q2. Professional fees were $6.5 million higher, primarily related to ongoing IT projects as well as regulatory compliance initiatives. Finally, we also saw $2 million decrease in business development and travel expense due to a seasonally higher Q1 expense.", "Turning to capital; our bank level tier I leverage ratio increased by 37 basis points to 7.56% and our holding company level tier I leverage ratio increased by 39 basis points to 8.08% due to earnings and lower average assets as a result of the decline in deposits in the second quarter. Our risk-based capital ratios were effectively unchanged at the bank level and increase modestly at the holding company level. In closing, we delivered a solid quarter in our businesses performing well overall with healthy activity among our clients and stable credit quality. We view the ongoing recalibration evaluation in VC investment levels as a healthy development for the long-term. We expect continued growth in the second half of 2016 and could see upside if the broader environment improves faster than expected. In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering high quality growth, driving fee income, maintaining stable credit quality and continuing to position ourselves for long term growth. ", "Thank you, and now I will ask the operator to open the lines for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo, please go ahead. ", "Jared Shaw", "Hi, good afternoon. Maybe just first on the expenses, you have the $3.6 million increase in consulting for regulatory compliance and issues. Can you give us more detail into what that is working on and what is the timeline on that in terms of implementation and would we expect to see that being offset down the road with additional hires or is it more of a software and systems program?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So it is a little bit of mix of everything Jack, I mean you have obviously got some infrastructure builds to move obviously expand quite a lot of growth the last couple of years. Certainly as we move towards that sea car level of $50 billion in assets and some of the preparations around there. And even these other areas in risk and BSA and just all across the board. ", "Jared Shaw", "Okay. And once those are implemented though that is going to be offset by additional hires or is it more implementing the systems through the professional services line?", "Greg Becker", "Jared, this is Greg. I will tie to what Mike said, so it's so hard to look at it on a one quarter basis so I would say you really have to look at it over multiple quarters so this past quarter, it was a higher level of consulting we had coming and helping out in a couple of areas and when that happens it tends to be a little more of a blip so we believe that will stabilize over the coming quarters. ", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, great, thanks. On the credit side with the addition of that new sponsor led by our loan into NPAs, could you give us an update on what the status is of the other sponsor-led loans had migrated into our NPA status in earlier quarters and what do you think the timeline and resolution could be on this one that's in there?", "Michael Descheneaux", "This is Mike here, on the two that are in there from prior periods, they have, I guess I will say they are between stable to modestly improving but as we said before these turnarounds do take time and so while cautiously optimistic that they will turn out okay in the end, we still think it's a little too early to call those. For the new addition, candidly it is still a bit of a fluid situation and so unable to really say at this point as was the case with the prior too, just how that was going to turnout.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, thanks. And then just finally with the news of the UK with the Brexit, does that change your thoughts in terms of potentially having an additional full service branch and operation more Euro-based or do you still feel that with the London branch you will still be able to continue to service most of the European customers?", "Greg Becker", "Yes Jared, this is Greg. So I guess there is two ways to think about Brexit; one is on a direct basis and then there is the indirect. On a direct basis, from our standpoint there really isn't much of an impact, the UK market -- the UK office services the UK. At this point we don't have other offices in Europe, although overtime, given what's happened it would be easier for us to go directly, branch directly from the U.S. So again, don't expect a lot of impact on a direct basis. If we were to go into Europe again what we talked about in the past is that it may be looking at branching into Germany maybe branching into the Nordics but again we don't believe Brexit really has any impact on that. On a macro basis obviously disappointing part was with the impact of the you know longer term rates and the likelihood were being not likely scenario of rate increases later this year, so that that the macro impact but on truly on micro direct basis we really don't expect any real impact.", "Jared Shaw", "Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Brett Rabatin", "Hi, good afternoon. Wanted to -- I guess, first I ask on the on the deposit the decline wasn't a big surprise but you're essentially saying kind of missing all digit on an average basis for this year. What's sort of changing the dynamic going forward that you experience in 2Q or how do you see that changing over the back half the year?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. Brett, I'll start and Mike may want to add something. When you look at a second half year right there right now again as we look at it the addition of client growth that we've had which is great, combined what we believe a market that's going to continue to be unsettled, little bit soft in fund raising, it's going to really cost deposits to kind of be flat for the second half the year, that's how we look at it. There is obviously a risk that it could be lower much like the second quarter was, if you see a lot of the M&A activity, if you see our clients being acquired -- if you see clients acquiring and if fund raising or actually investment declines even more than it was in the second quarter, obviously we don't expect that to happen but it could happen. So that's kind of a color for the second half the year.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay. And then I guess the other thing I was curious about was Greg you mentioned the near-term challenge -- you were facing some near-term challenges but obviously, credits -- I think the fear was a little too robust relative to your results. In terms of the challenges that you're saying is that VC fund raising that lower sort of concerns you more than early-stage software or is it kind of be your bigger concern about kind of the near-term?", "Greg Becker", "This is how I would describe this, I think you're accurate. When we gave guidance in the second quarter, we really tried to look at the provision for the balance of the year and the outlook but we had a lot of cab [ph], we said it could be worse than this depending upon how the market plays out. How I look at what happened in the second quarter is that there was a lot more clarity and that's why we're more confident in the second half year, maybe volatile in the quarter-to-quarter basis but the outlook we gave -- we feel good about it and what drives that is what we -- what would have happened in the second quarter and the first quarter which is, you have companies again that failed to raise that next round of financing, they've put themselves up for sale, they can't find a buyer. We had roughly 15 early-stage companies that weren't able to accomplish that in the first quarter, we had 11 in the second quarter. And again, if you look at the average for 15 it was around 10. So again, feel pretty good about where we are from an outlook perspective, and its more clarity which is where we are right now.", "Brett Rabatin ", "Great, thank. Good point, thanks for the color.", "Operator", "And our next question is from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good afternoon. Back on the credit topic, I just want to understand a little more around the drivers of the deterioration you're seeing in the mid and later-stage as well as sponsored buyout portfolios. I mean, I get the early-stage deterioration, even the pullback in inflows from VPs and private equity. I get how it can impact that part of the book. Can you give me -- is there any commonality between the deterioration you're seeing in the sponsored buyout credit and then maybe in the later stage, just to understand that better?", "Greg Becker", "John, this is Greg. I'll start and Marc will want to add some color. There is really kind of the three buckets; so one is the early stage, which we've talked a lot about and I don't think there needs to be a lot more discussion around that. The second one is the mid stage, and it's the buyouts. And then that mid and later stage, we don't expect to see a pattern, we're going to see one or two deals on a quarterly basis that have the same issues or similar issues to early stage, so there's no pattern, no surprises there. The same thing holds true with the sponsor-led buyout. What you have to remember is you go back -- we've been in this business for 7 to 8 years, and when you look at that, you're going to have one or two credits over time in a given year that actually do end up becoming non-performing. What Marc has said repeatedly is that, although they may go non-performing, because these are more substantial companies with stronger revenue, their cash flow may just be a little bit off. Once that happens, it takes a little bit longer for them to recover and get back on the right track. As we said with the two credits already mentioned, they're tracking, they're performing, in a solid way but they're just not there far enough for us to kind of take them back in becoming performing loans, so no real pattern that we would see.", "Marc Cadieux", "Hey, it's Marc. The only thing that I would add to that is that there is -- I think, part of your question, there is no correlation between what's caused distress in the early-stage portfolio segment versus what's happened in the sponsor-led buyout segment. In particular to the couple of NPLs that we have in sponsor-led buyout, those have really been company-specific issues, not indicative of any broader trend, not indicative of any stress more broadly in that part of the portfolio or elsewhere. And then the only other thing that I would just reiterate is that we are reiterating our guidance on net charge-offs for the balance of the year.", "John Pancari", "Okay, and then related to that -- of that, this will help with some of the clarity around that. The year-over-year increase in NPAs, the 23% year-over-year increase that we're looking at right now, I know you have a pay-off you've flagged, but obviously there can be movements in a quarter. Of that 23% year-over-year increase in NPAs, how much of that was early stage?", "Marc Cadieux", "It's the minority for sure. If you just look at our sponsor-led buyouts today, right, those three represent the vast majority of the non-performing loans. I think its $82 million in the aggregate. And that really was and remains the driver. It was the driver for why it increased year-over-year, or period-over-period, and why NPLs remain elevated relative to 2015.", "Michael Descheneaux", "And maybe the only thing I would add to that is those three that Marc in mentioning in the sponsor-led buyout, the roughly $80 million or so, we have roughly, not quite but roughly around, half of that has been set aside for reserves.", "John Pancari", "Okay, got it, Mike. And then one last thing if I could ask, you mentioned Mike, in your comments, the ample access to liquidity. Could you just talk about that a little bit more? Would it be primarily coming from additional securities portfolio sales or how do you view that? Thanks.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes, John. So just on a quarterly basis, we expect to see maturity of our existing investment securities portfolio somewhere between $700 million and $900 million. And going back to Q2 and even in Q1, we just had such extraordinary loan growth in there, so we had to accelerate or sell some of the securities in order to fund the loan growth. So right now, again, if we're more or less averaging below that $700 million to $900 million, then I don't anticipate having to sell any securities. But again, if we happen to be pleasantly surprised by longer than expected loan growth, then yes, we would -- that one option would be to sell. We also do have borrowing capabilities as well to pledge our investment securities as well. So we just look at whether or not the funding shortfall is more permanent or more temporary before we make that call in order to sell securities.", "John Pancari", "Got it, all right. Thanks Mike.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Chris McGratty", "Good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. If I could ask the credit question a little bit differently, the charge-off guidance of 30 to 50, it sounds like, is unchanged, and I think, in June, Greg, you said it was kind of high end to that and that's what we were tracking. If loan growth remains a little bit stronger than we thought relative to the last quarter, should we be thinking about a provision, maybe not like the first quarter but maybe more like the second quarter, if not a little higher.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, I'll start. This is Greg and then, maybe Marc may want to add. If you look at the provision in the second quarter, roughly $10 million of that related to loan growth and that's because, again, we had such a strong -- both average and period and loan growth. So if that continued at that pace, more than likely the provision would be on the higher side because you're supporting that higher loan growth. So yes, it probably wouldn't look more like that. We don't expect growth to be that strong for the second half of the year but if it is, yes, you'd see a higher provision.", "Chris McGratty", "Okay. And then the charge-offs still kind of over-run based on what you see today?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, it would be in that -- I mean, it is a little bit a function of if you see substantial loan growth and, again, the loan growth is coming from a very high-quality, low-risk PE/VC portfolio, so that maybe it ticked down a little bit on a percentage basis because of the quality of the overall portfolio and the growth, but generally speaking, you'd be correct.", "Marc Cadieux", "But as we had mentioned in the first quarter, our guidance on the net charge-offs is 30 basis points for the full year, but as we indicated in Q1, we're probably going to come closer to the higher net range, so we're still saying the same thing here, which is more closer to the 50 basis points range.", "Chris McGratty", "Got it. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Hi, everybody. I wanted to drill down a little bit on the deposits. What percent of the deposits are from the corporate and the growth in corporate finance clients? And maybe how did that change quarter-over-quarter?", "Marc Cadieux", "So Steve, it really hasn't changed a whole lot. By and large, what we've seen historically is more of the early-stage emerging techs kind of account for 50% of our deposit base, plus or minus. Then you look at kind of the PE/VC funds account for roughly 25%, and then you have the remaining growth in corporate finance. So it really has been fairly consistent.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, got you. And then, Mike, if we look specifically at just that piece from startups, could you talk about, one, the reduction in inflows that you're seeing from new startups? Maybe just talk about cash burn rates from existing startups that, when you put those together and you look at the total pool of funds from startups, how has that changed in the quarter?", "Marc Cadieux", "So as Greg mentioned, we did see quite strong growth or acquisition of new clients. We had over 1,000 new clients coming on. So they're still bringing in a healthy amount of flow in there, and maybe it's probably a little smaller sizes than we've seen in the past, given the PE/VC funding environment. So it's -- there's certainly a little bit of slowdown in that area and I think that the rest of it would probably be coming from the growth in corporate finance stage that's affecting some of the deposit levels.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes, and just to add on to that, Steve, again, what we're seeing is where maybe a Series B round was going to get $20 million to $25 million of round, that's down to $15 million to $20 million. It doesn't take many of those across a large portfolio to have an impact on the overall deposits, given that these companies are still burning cash.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, that's helpful. And then the comments around the slowdown in fundraising, when you look at the capital call growth, you guys had really solid growth, particularly capital calls below $20 million, which are typically VC. So you're saying fundraising is down but investing is up. So you're saying VC is used to deploy existing capital that's already been raised but having a tough time raising new capital?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So fundraising is -- was basically down a little bit but not much, and it depends upon, again, what numbers you look at. We're using MBCA numbers and it was roughly $12 billion in the first quarter and roughly $9 billion in the second quarter. But net-net still a very strong fundraising cycle, so I guess that's one way to look at it. The pitch book had even higher numbers; I think $13 billion in the second quarter. My view is that doesn't have much of an impact. I still think it bodes well for the second half of the year and into 2017 about the capital that will be deployed. ", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Got you. And then just one final one for Marc, just give a little color on the reserve decline on performing loans, which you cite in the release?", "Marc Cadieux", "So that decline was driven by the source of the loan growth, with the vast majority of it, I think it was 70% plus or minus, having come from the high-quality capital call borrowings where our credit quality experience has been very good. That change in portfolio mix is the driver of the 2 or 3 basis points decline. ", "Greg Becker", "As we have talked about this before, as you look at the composition of our loan portfolio, today the Private Equity Venture Capital, the wine and the private bank represent 50% of our total loan portfolio and if we see historically those that perform exceptionally well in terms of credit quality, so yes that's something to remind ourselves about the risk profile has actually been improving over the years. ", "Steven Alexopoulos", "That's very helpful, thanks guys. ", "Operator", "And we have a question from Joe Morford from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.", "Joe Morford ", "Thanks, good afternoon, just a couple of follow-ups. I guess first curious about the increases in the off balance sheet, sweep money market funds, is that just kind of a greater focus internally or there is this perhaps the beginning of any kind of broader trends type behavior?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, Joe this is Greg. It is mainly just a product that we had in place and it is setup mainly for early-staged companies and so this is one of those things setup over the last 18 months as we have this big onslaught of deposits over the last couple of years. We were looking at ways to kind of balance that on and off balance sheet numbers and the off balance sheet sweep wanted us to do that. We did that very successfully as you see in numbers and it has grown dramatically so I would say it's more of a product guidance that we have as opposed to any shift in behavior of clients. ", "Joe Morford ", "Would you then think that we will probably see more regular growth on a quarterly basis going forward in this product then?", "Greg Becker", "You will see growth in that product and the question will be, I think the question we are asking ourselves which is how do we want to look at the balance of early stage companies and how much is appropriate to be on the balance sheet and how much of it is appropriate to be off the balance sheet. I think you will see more of it come on but it may take a quarter or two to see that behavior change. ", "Joe Morford", "Okay. And then the other just a follow up on the UK is curious and I recognize it is probably early but just what kind of impact did Brexit have on business activity in general amongst startups and you know loan demand and things like that?", "Greg Becker", "Joe, this is Greg, I will start and one way to look at it is what the FX exchange of what was happening. You had a little bit of a slowdown in April. May actually had a pretty big drop off and then towards the end of June, once the announcement was made, we had a lot of activity in the end of the quarter. You know how does that play out? You know I think given the volatility again our outlook is we are going to see decent numbers in second half of the year. But it was interesting to watch the actually transaction volume. There was definitely a hesitation of deal activity that we saw and now that it's over it's amazing how fast markets recovered with the exception of the 10-year treasury and along with interest rates and just the activity in the UK. We spent a lot of time talking to our team of clients and what's great about our client base is that they are very resilient. They look at this, they saw it happen, they adjusted it very quickly and now they are executing on how this will impact them but in the end we don't think it will be a dramatic impact. ", "Joe Morford", "Okay, that's helpful. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Ken Zerbe", "Question on the reduction in your guidance, I know it is generally small but the core fee income growth is kind of been really big positive for this story. Is the reduction in your outlook for core fee income solely a reflection of what happened this quarter or is there something fundamentally, that it has fundamentally changed going forward?", "Greg Becker", "Ken, this is Greg, I will start and Mike may want to add some things. When you look at the quarter, part of it was driven by what happened in Q2. We did see a slowdown in spend of cards because people are more focused on lowering their burn rate number one, so that's part of it and that will trickle through a little bit of Q3 and Q4. That being said, on a positive side you can look at the card revenue, you can look at the penetration of cards that is still happening. You can look at the deals that were winning at either virtual card or other card solutions. You can look at what we just announced with first data and that will bode well for the second half of the year but really for the 2017, we still expect growth in the second half of the year of our card revenue. ", "Michael Descheneaux", "And the only thing I will add is also mind the off balance sheet funds that we had given the tempering and the fund raising and investing levels, that is also bringing down our outlook, kind of our estimates for those off balance sheet funds which as you know we capture a fee on that as well too so certainly some of that core fee income adjusting downwards relates to that. ", "Ken Zerbe", "Got it, okay. And then last question, on Page 18, you obviously break out the private equity venture capital between the $20 million, above $20 million and below $20 million, can you break out private equity capital cost versus capital cost?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Just on an overall basis, we are probably somewhere about an 80:20 mix somewhere around there. About 80% being PE and 20% VC on an overall total loan portfolio related to the private equity venture capital portfolio. ", "Ken Zerbe", "Did VC capital calls virtually decline in the quarter?", "Marc Cadieux", "It's Marc. I don't -- I would have to go look at it to be sure but I don't believe they decline, I think they were relatively speaking stable with Q1 but if we were to compare to 2015 utilization on the venture capital side sort of reflective of the slower pace of venture deployment, and it would have been down. ", "Michael Descheneaux", "Certainly the dominance of growth in that category would certainly come from the private equity this quarter and the last couple of quarters. ", "Ken Zerbe", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Hi guys, just a quick question for Marc in terms of the sponsor led buyout books, if I got you correctly I think you said you had about 50% in reserve set aside those three non-accrual loans. I am just thinking if you can remind us in terms of, is this portfolio generally hire lost content portfolio or you have got to look at it on one loan basis, just sort of give us sense of how should we think about the lost content on this book if you actually have these one off non-accruals?", "Marc Cadieux", "Right, so it's a good question and to back up a little bit, we have had in the entire history we have been doing this a total of 4 not performing loans and 0 lost experience thus far and so it remains to be seen and in the absence of that we rely to some degree on broader industry data to get a sense for lost content. But then we look much more specifically at the individual loans and individual situations and we set reserves appropriate to what we think the probability of various outcomes would be and then as I said before these turnarounds do take a while and thus the reserves associated with them, if they are going to turn out good, take a while to get to a place where you feel confident enough about the outcome to consider a release. ", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Got it, that's all I had, thank you.", "Operator", "And we have a question from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill and Partners. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Deer", "Most of my questions have been addressed but one on the guidance for loan growth, I'm just curious historically you guys have had a fair level pay downs trickle in the capital call lines early in the year, last year it seemed to kind of drag down into the middle of the year, how does, is that seasonal factor, not really evidence this year or how does that play into the guidance which you have laid out?", "Marc Cadieux", "Aaron, it's Marc again, and I think what we saw this year is reflective of the evolution of that portfolio where we historically would have seen to your point more pay downs in the first quarter as the portfolio has become more heavily weighted towards private equity funds. The private equity funds tend to borrow larger and borrow longer and it's the combination of those two things and again that becoming the dominant part of the portfolio that I think is changing the historical pattern to one where we may not see that same first quarter decline that we would have seen in prior years. ", "Aaron Deer", "Okay, that's helpful. And then on the tax rate, I believe there were a couple of items that were referenced in the text of the press release, but no values of that I saw anyway, were those kind offsetting, is that why we saw what appeared to be a fairly normal effective tax or do they just too small that they'd -- they'd didn't show up?", "Greg Becker", "They're just too small Aaron.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. Very good thanks for taking my question.", "Operator", "And we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to our CEO, Greg Becker. Please go ahead.", "Greg Becker", "Great, thank you. Just want to thank everyone for joining us today. As you can hear from our remarks, although I did -- our innovation market is still a little bit soft. The good news there is we feel there is a lot more clarity than working in the first quarter and that gives us kind of a more confident and in kind of what our outlook is. That being said, again as we try to reference and I think it's really important, we are making investments not just for the short-term but for the long-term and we believe that's really going to create a long-term growth for us and develop kind of a broader product set for our client. So we are talking about where we are and we talked about the clarity and just want to thank all our clients for their trust in us. And also thank all our employees for their incredible work. Thanks, and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating.

My name is Sherry [ph] and I'll be your operator for today's call.", "[Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary. Meghan, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you. Thanks everyone for joining us today.", "Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our third quarter 2016 financial results. And they'll be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call. In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "We'll limit the call, including Q&A, to an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks, Meghan. Good afternoon and thanks everyone for joining us today.", "We had a strong third quarter, delivering our highest ever quarterly earnings per share of $2.12 and net income of $111 million. These results reflected solid performance across our business: healthy loan growth, continued core fee income growth, and stable credit quality. They also reflected significant venture capital and private equity related gains. Since we are approaching the end of the year, I'm going to let Mike give you the details on our third quarter performance and I will focus primarily on the market environment and our expectations for 2017.", "Overall, the markets for us and our clients are healthy, despite some lingering impact from the VC market recalibration in the first half of 2016. Venture capital continues to perform strongly, although activity remains concentrated on larger funds and larger later-stage investments. The National Venture Capital Association stated 2016 is on pace to be a record-breaking year for raising capital based on the $32.4 billion raised to date, a quarter of that concentrated in six funds larger than $1 billion each.", "Likewise, 2016 is expected to be the second biggest year in a decade for venture investment, with $56 billion invested year to date in nearly 6,000 companies. This is despite the decline in completed financings in the third quarter. Consistent with prior quarters, investors in the third quarter wrote bigger checks to fewer companies, with a sustained focus on later-stage companies. By comparison, the dollar run rate for 2016 is just below 2015's peak of $79 billion, although the number of investments is down by about 20%.", "In spite of an emphasis on later-stage companies, early-stage investing is alive and well, although it has been dominated for the last few quarters by a growing group of angels and micro-funds making seed investments. In addition, corporate strategic investments are becoming mainstream as established companies invest in new technologies, products, and delivery mechanisms in order to remain relevant and competitive. In a growing number of instances, we've seen entrepreneurs bypass traditional venture capital altogether to accept large strategic investments from corporates.", "Turning to exits. The IPO market [inaudible] noticeably in the third quarter, with 12 venture-backed tech and life science IPOs, six of which were SVB clients. So the IPO markets appear to be picking up. And while we do not expect them to get back to the 2014 levels, a growing number of clients are positioning themselves to go out in the next 18 months.", "Of course, the majority of venture-backed companies exit through acquisitions and buyouts, which accounted for 91% of venture exit activity in the third quarter. Median M&A values have increased significantly from last year, primarily due to acquisitions of such high-profile companies as Jet.com and Dollar Shave Club, each of which was acquired for more than $1 billion.", "And while the number of acquisitions was down in the third quarter, our high-growth clients continue to acquire and be acquired at a brisk pace. From our perspective, and quarterly fluctuations notwithstanding, these signs point to continued strength in the innovation market, with healthy new company formation, strong capital raising, growing funding options for our entrepreneurial clients, and an improving exit potential. This healthy level of activity overall reinforces our optimism about our prospects for growth in our business.", "Our priorities for enabling our long-term growth have not changed. We remain focused on enhancing our client relationships and building our brand, expanding our platform capabilities and reach, and strengthening risk management to help support our growth. We continue to strengthen our unique position in the global innovation market and our ability to meaningfully impact our client success through our networks, advice and insight. We do this by building deep and long-term relationships with entrepreneurs and influencers in our industry, creating a platform that allows us to offer a great client experience, providing our clients with unique events and valuable introductions and doing it all globally. These efforts have enabled us to add clients at a healthy pace over the long term, including more than 1,000 new corporate clients in the third quarter.", "As we've grown our client base and continue to work with larger global companies, we've made numerous investments in our platform, capabilities and global reach. These investments support our efforts to grow by enabling us to build deep, substantial, long-term client relationships that offer significant revenue opportunities over the long term.", "Our payment strategy is a piece of these efforts and includes allowing clients to streamline and automate their accounts payable through our multi-card platform, cutting the time it takes for clients to integrate their systems with hours from weeks to days through our API banking system; offering clients the ability to receive payments globally on any platform through our partnership with First Data; and providing the core banking and payments infrastructure for a growing group of fin tech and e-commerce companies.", "The ability to do this all globally is another essential part of our equation. To this end, we continue to build out our capabilities, expertise and platforms to meet the needs of growing client base in the U.K. We remained focused on building client momentum over the long term in our China joint venture bank, and we're investing -- or we're investigating potential new areas of global expansion such as Germany and Canada, subject to regulatory approvals.", "Underpinning these efforts to enhance our brand and expand our capabilities and reach is our continued focus on investing in, enhancing risk management and compliance, to meet regulatory requirements and expectations as we grow. We continued to invest and build out our risk management function.", "We recently hired a new Chief Risk Officer, Laura Izurieta, who has significant experience in financial services and enterprise risk management, having most recently served as chief risk officer for CapitalOne's retail and direct bank.", "We continued to invest in and prepare for enhanced prudential standards relating to risk management, capital liquidity, and other areas relevant to financial institutions larger than $50 billion. We believe we are making meaningful progress in all these efforts as evidenced by our continued strong financial performance, and we are confident in our ability to continue to drive these priorities in 2017.", "With that in mind, I'd like to turn our preliminary -- turn to our preliminary business drivers, outlook for 2017.", "We are expecting solid performance with trends similar to those in 2016 and making the following assumptions: continued healthy activity among our clients; gradual recovery by the early-stage markets from the effects of the recent VC recalibration; stable U.S. economy and no dramatic changes in the regulatory environment. At the same time, we expect a low-rate environment and persistent competition to provide continued headwinds.", "Consistent with our recent approach and irrespective of the forward curve, we assume no market interest rate increases between now and the end of 2017. Nevertheless, we expect solid performance with potential upside if rates do increase.", "There are six basic drivers of our 2017 outlook I want to highlight. First, average loan growth in the high teens. We expect this growth to come across our loan portfolio with continued strength in private equity and the private bank due to our continued efforts to increase our market penetration with middle-market private equity firms and individual influencers in the innovation economy.", "Second, average deposit growth in the mid to high single digits. This assumes diminishing effects from the recent VC market recalibration and a healthy pace of client activity overall. Third, net interest income growth in the low double digits. This assumes continued growth in high-quality but lower-yielding loans and a smaller investment securities portfolio compared to 2016. If rates did rise, consistent with the forward curve, it would increase our net interest income outlook to the mid teens.", "Fourth, stable credit quality overall. We expect full-year net charge-offs to be between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans, consistent with our expectations for 2016. Fifth, core fee income growth in the mid to high teens. This would largely be driven by foreign exchange and credit cards and payments. And finally, non-interest expense growth net of NCI in the high single digits, consistent with our expectations for 2016.", "So we are optimistic about 2017 assuming no significant deterioration of the U.S. or global economies and our markets. And if rates did rise, consistent with the forward curve, we would expect to see upside in net interest income and NIM.", "Let me close by saying that we're pleased with the continued strength of our core banking business and improvements in the VC-backed exit market. Our performance is a testament to the power of our platform, the resilience of our markets, and our ability to execute and drive solid results even in challenging markets. We believe our focus in the most vibrant industries and the best clients around the globe will continue to provide growth and opportunities over the long term.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon everyone.", "Today I will highlight and focus on the following items. First, healthy loan growth driven by private equity capital call lines and private bank. Second, stabilization of total client funds. Third, higher net interest income and a higher net interest margin. Fourth, stable credit quality. Fifth, significant gains from warrants and PE and VC-related investment securities. Sixth, higher core fee income. Seventh, higher expenses driven by incentive compensation. And finally, increased capital ratios across the board.", "Let us start with loans. Average loans grew by $448 million or 2.5% to $18.6 billion, driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and the private bank. This reflects relatively healthy growth despite the headwinds from some loan repayments related to certain clients being acquired, as well as the impact of Brexit on exchange rates on our foreign currency denominated loan balances.", "While we could see some repayments of private equity capital call lines of credit given the significant growth we have had over the last four quarters, our pipeline remained strong. For the full year 2016, we expect to come in near the lower end of our recently increased outlook range of percentage growth in the mid 20s.", "Now let us move to total client funds, consisting of on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance sheet client investment funds. Average total client funds were flat in the third quarter at $81 billion, reflecting a much smaller decrease of $250 million in average deposits, compared to a decrease of $1.1 billion in the second quarter. This was largely offset by an increase of $222 million in average off-balance sheet client investment funds.", "The decrease in average deposits continue to be impacted by the recalibration of venture capital investment levels and activities from the first half of the year. Specifically, we saw a slower VC funding for certain early-stage clients, a higher proportion of new early-stage clients putting funds into off-balance sheet investments, and a relatively high pace of acquisitions of corporate finance clients. Foreign currency denominated deposit balances were also impacted by changes in exchange rates post-Brexit.", "Nevertheless, we believe we are starting to see a stabilization of deposits or possible shift back toward positive deposit growth as September average deposit balances were approximately $900 million greater than August balances. Additionally, period-end deposits increased by $593 million and period-end off-balance sheet client investment funds increased $272 million due to a solid pace of new client acquisition and robust inflows from private equity clients. For the full year 2016, we expect deposit growth to come in at the high end of our mid-single digits growth range.", "Turning to net interest income and our net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $5.8 million to $289.2 million in the third quarter, compared to growth of $1.9 million in the second quarter. This increase was primarily related to loan prepayment fees and one additional day in the quarter. For the full year 2016, we expect net interest income to come in at the low end of our mid-teens growth range.", "Interest income from loans increased by $8.9 million, of which approximately $4.4 million was related to higher average loan balances. Fees on two large loan prepayments and one extra day in the quarter accounted for the remainder of the increase. Gross loan yields decreased by 4 basis points, primarily due to growth in lower-yielding capital call lines and private bank loans.", "Interest income from investment securities declined by $3.2 million, primarily due to lower average balances. These lower balances reflect the effect of the second quarter sale of $1 billion of investment securities and use of portfolio cash flows in the third quarter to support loan growth and repay short-term borrowings. Overall, investment security yields remained at 1.62% in the quarter.", "Our net interest margin increased by 2 basis points to 2.75% due to the shifting mix of our average interest-earning assets toward higher-yielding loans versus investment securities. For the full year 2016, we expect our net interest margin to be in the middle of our range of between 2.6% and 2.8%.", "Now let us move to credit quality, which was stable in the quarter, with the early-stage portfolio showing fewer signs of stress than in the previous two quarters, and the rest of the portfolio performing well overall. As a reminder, it is important to note that our early-stage portfolio continues to be only about 6% of our total loans.", "Our allowance for loan losses was $240.6 million at the end of the third quarter of 1.25% of total gross loans, an overall decrease of $4.2 million compared to the second quarter. The decrease in the allowance is primarily driven by a decrease in specific reserves for non-performing loans, mainly due to charge-offs of non-performing loans that were previously reserved for. This was partially offset by additional reserves for loan growth as well as a shift in the mix of our performing loan portfolio.", "Our loan loss provision was $19 million, compared to $36.3 million in the second quarter. This amount reflects provisions of $8 million for performing loans, $5.5 million for charge-offs not previously reserved for, $4 million for non-performing loans, and $2.8 million for loan growth. The provision for non-performing loans is net of a $5.5 million partial reserve release for one of our non-performing sponsored buyout loans due to credit improvement.", "Net charge-offs were $22.5 million or 48 basis points in the third quarter, compared to $19.4 million or 43 basis points in the second quarter. This reflects $24.6 million of gross charge-offs.", "Non-performing loans decreased by $18.4 million to $106.2 million or 55 basis points in the third quarter. The decrease was driven largely by charge-offs of $19.1 million, of which $18 million was previously reserved for, and repayments of $15 million, partially offset by $15.9 million in new non-performing loans, primarily coming from a mix of early-stage companies and one late-stage company.", "We had no new additions to non-performing loans from our sponsored buyout portfolio during the quarter, and in fact, we resolved one of the three last week to a sell of the loan. The impact of the sale in the fourth quarter will be a charge-off of $7 million, a reduction in non-performing loans of $22.2 million, and a reserve release of $3.3 million.", "Regarding our credit quality outlook for the full year 2016, our allowance outlook remains unchanged. We expect to come in near the top of our net loan charge-off range of 30 to 50 basis points.", "Finally, we are decreasing our outlook for non-performing loans as a percentage of total gross loans to a range of 40 to 60 basis points. We now expect to come in at the middle of that range.", "Now let us move to non-interest income, which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and PE and VC-related investment securities. I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further details.", "GAAP non-interest income was $144.1 million, compared to $112.8 million in the second quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interest was $139.5 million, compared to $111.2 million in the second quarter. The increase was mainly related to warrant gains of $21.6 million, compared to $5.1 million in the second quarter. These gains were driven primarily by valuation gains on our warrant portfolio related to the improving IPO and M&A activities. In particular, we saw $10.3 million of unrealized gains related to the IPO of Acacia Communications in the third quarter.", "We also had non-GAAP net gains on investment securities net of non-controlling interest of $18.4 million, compared to $21.6 million in the prior quarter. This reflects unrealized gains of $7.2 million related primarily to our investment in one fund, which reflects a significant new funding realm at a higher valuation in one of the underlying investments; and $4.3 million in unrealized gains from our managed funds of funds reflective of M&A and IPO activity of the investments held by the funds. Additionally, we had $6.3 million of distributions from our PE and VC-related investments.", "On a related note, we also recognized $6.7 million in carried interest related to the fund that drove the $7.2 million of gains previously mentioned. This income is reflected in other non-interest income.", "Moving on to core fee income. Core fee income increased $6 million or 8.2% to $80.5 million in the third quarter. This increase was driven primarily by higher credit card, foreign exchange and letter of credit fee income. As a reminder, core fee income also includes deposit service charges, lending-related fees, and client investment fees.", "Credit card and payment fees increased by $2.9 million to $18.3 million, compared to $15.4 million in the second quarter. This increase reflects a one-time reclassification of $1.8 million in expenses related to certain merchant services client contracts to other non-interest expense, as well as an increase in interchange fee income due to higher volumes.", "In general, we continue to see lower spending on our business credit card by some clients as a result of the lingering impact of slower early-stage investment in the last few quarters and continuing client focus on expense management. While this appears to be easing somewhat, the impact is still noticeable, although long term we believe we will continue to see growth in this area.", "Foreign exchange income increased by $1.9 million to $25.9 million, an all-time high for the quarter, driven primarily by strong activity among our global clients.", "As a result of lower spending on our business credit cards and lower client investment fees due to the VC recalibration in the first half of the year, we are lowering our full-year 2016 core fee income outlook from the low 20s to the high teens and expect to end the year near the top of that range. To put that in perspective, the actual dollar difference we are talking about is being original -- or between the original and revised outlook is approximately $8 million.", "Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense increased by $21.4 million to $221.8 million. This increase was almost entirely due to high incident compensation and benefits related to our significant warrants and PE and VC-related investment gains in the third quarter.", "This included the following components: a $16 million increase in incentive compensation expense related to our current expectations for our full-year performance relative to our internal targets; and an increase of $2.7 million and other employee incentives and benefits related to the incentive compensation increase; and finally, a $2.3 million increase in salaries due to a higher average number of employees in the third quarter.", "For the full year 2016, we expect to come in at the top of our expense outlook range of the high single digits, due to high incident compensation related to our outperformance on warrant and investment security gains year to date.", "Turning quickly to capital, our capital ratios increased across the board by 20 to 30 basis points at the holding company level and 18 to 20 basis points at the bank level due to earnings.", "Now onto the closing. Overall we delivered a very strong quarter. Activity among our clients remains healthy in spite of some lingering effects on the first half of the year. Moreover, we are seeing signs of increased confidence as evidenced by stronger exit market activity and growing momentum relative to the first half of the year. Although market pressures can sometimes present challenges from one quarter to another, over the long term, we believe our focus, platform and execution will enable us to deliver solid results.", "In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering high-quality balance sheet growth, growing fee income, maintaining stable credit quality, and continuing to position ourselves for the long term.", "Thank you. And now I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]", "And then we have our first question from Ken Zerbe of Morgan Stanley.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Great. Thank you. Good evening.", "I guess maybe just first question on credit, and this probably relates to the 2017 preliminary outlook that you gave of the 30 to 50 basis points. I get how this year, right, with the turmoil we had in the tech market earlier in the year, that it drove up higher credit losses and you ended up taking -- you're at the higher end of your range. But when you look at the 2017, the ultimate charge-offs guidance really doesn't change much, but I would have thought that the underlying environment would have actually been a better credit environment for SIVB. Why is -- am I thinking about that the wrong way?", "Greg Becker", "So, Ken, this is Greg. I'll start and then Marc will I'm sure want to add.", "I guess the first thing when you think about the range of 30 to 50 basis points, although it says only 30 to 50 basis points, on a percentage basis that's a pretty wide range. And so this year maybe at the higher end of the range. And clearly if things are better, things perform better, we could be at the mid range or even a lower part of that range. But you also have to look at there's still going to be a calibration that's going to happen with early stage, and it didn't stop in the third quarter, it just kind of diminished in the third quarter. So we still may see -- we expect to see more of that in 2017.", "Marc Cadieux", "I have nothing to add.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Perfect. And then just the other question I had. Could you just help reconcile, in terms of the net interest income, I think it was low double-digits growth for 2017, do you expect high loan -- or high teens loan growth? Deposit growth, if I heard right, was actually getting better either late in the quarter, early this quarter, I forget which. What is the expectation for deposit growth in 2017? Because presumably you have to have some sort of either sharply lower margin or sizable deposit outflows to bring that NII lower than loan growth.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Well, I'll start there. I mean, the one thing to remember, Ken, is that when we're adding on some of these loans here, a lot of our strength in our loan growth over the last couple of years has come from the capital call lines of credit and the private bank mortgages, which are at a lower yield than the overall portfolio. So I think that would be, at least when you do the math, that's going to be one of the largest drivers of that.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "Got it. So, presumably, just we're going to see lower NIM all things equal?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Well, you potentially could see higher -- a slightly higher NIM, right? Because some of those loans are presumably going to be issued above the current NIM levels, but what I was trying to say is that you're going to have some pressure to keep the NIM down or not moving as aggressively up because of these loans are just lower-yielding loans compared to the rest of the loan portfolio.", "Ken Zerbe - Morgan Stanley", "All right. Okay. Thank you very much.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Steven Alexopoulos of JPMorgan.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Hey everybody.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "I wanted to start on the capital call business. I know the pace of VC investment trailed off a lot in the third quarter versus second quarter, and I would have thought the capital calls under $20 million would have actually declined, but they're up really nicely. Did you guys have smaller private equity capital calls hitting this quarter or did you just have VCs that remained very active?", "Greg Becker", "Steve, this is Greg, I'll start, and Marc I'm sure will want to add.", "So the growth wasn't that different. Part of this is just utilization, so you had utilization dropped a few percentage points. When you have that large of a portfolio, a few percentage points makes a pretty big difference. So that was probably the main driver of it. And that, as you know, that's not something you can sit back and predict, because it does vary from quarter to quarter. I think looking at what you would say the growth rate in total borrowings has been for the first three quarters is what I would look at, and that has been robust throughout the first nine months.", "Marc Cadieux", "The other thing I would add to that, Steve, it's Marc Cadieux, the correlation between the pace of venture investing and borrowings on our capital call portfolio is becoming less and less over time. Today, almost 80% of the total capital call line portfolio is private equity funds versus venture capital funds.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Got it. Okay. That's helpful.", "And then, when I think about the guidance, you know, obviously what happens in the exit markets are going to dictate what happens with the guidance. And this year was two different years, right? The first half was softer, the quarter was very strong. When we think about this, what's the general assumption for the exit markets you're making to hit this outlook? Do we need a better year than what we saw this year in 2016 or about the same?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "So, from an exit perspective, right, so the drivers, when you think about, are the six drivers that we talked about, that really doesn't have that dramatic of an impact on the drivers, whether it's loans, deposits, core fee income. Most of that occurs within security gains and warrant income, and, Steve, you know that we don't give guidance on that. What I would say on that is, if you look at, you know, the year that we had, this year, we expect to have this year, you know, that's just a function of what are your expectations for next year.", "As I said in my comments, today, right, and it can change quickly, as we all know, we see more of our clients that are looking to -- they're preparing for an IPO, in the next, as we said, in the next 18 months. You know, if that plays out, that'll be positive. But again, it's such a -- it changes so quickly, which is why we don't give guidance on securities gains or warrants.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Fair enough. And if I could squeeze one more, Meghan, please. On the fee income guidance, in the third quarter you guys actually had a really nice improvement in card revenue, yet you're taking down the full-year guide on the fee income and then, you know, next year looks a lot like the reduced guidance for 2016. Can you help me reconcile what's changed from that original guidance?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So, Steve, this is Mike here. I mean, first and foremost, I mean, when you look at the longer-term picture of core fee income, we believe that's going to go at a strong pace as you see in 2017. And it's certainly going to be driven by the card fee income and the payments fee income, and as well as the FX income.", "What happened in, I'd say, during 2016, we obviously had some slowdown in the spend on that as well too, and when you get more pointed to Q3 of this year, we had, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we did have a reclassification of some expenses, and that [inaudible] line item, which made it look a little bit healthier than what it really was. But nonetheless, the fundamentals are still strong, at least for us in the long term. So that I think is just the one delta, is what -- just that one anomaly here in the Q3, coupled with this -- definitely a slowdown in spending.", "The other thing to think about as well too is, you know, with the recalibration in the VC markets here this year, we did have a, I would say, a lower-than-expected amount of earnings from our client investment fees, the fees from the off-balance-sheet instruments, and that certainly held back some of the core fee income growth as well too. So, yeah.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. Thanks for all the color.", "Greg Becker", "And Steve, just to give you a little more perspective on the card stuff, if you look at the growth for the year, it's been actually healthy for the year, but it really is at the average spend for business credit cards has grown [inaudible] it's dropped. So that growth collectively during the course of the year, even though we're adding a lot of clients, is only up about 4%. So the cards as a platform, that business has actually been healthy. And so we expect it'll get back to a little bit more normal level in 2017.", "Steven Alexopoulos - JPMorgan", "Okay. I appreciate all the color. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "And then our next question is from Jared Shaw of Wells Fargo Securities.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Hi, good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Jared.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "I guess on the salaries, if we're looking at fourth quarter, should we be looking at excluding most of that $16 million from the warrants, or is that going to -- is that more of a catch-up or is that going to be dependent upon what we see for warrant gains next quarter?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah. Good point and good observation. I mean, exactly what you say, in Q3, because our outlook for the full year was that we're going to come in higher on the net income line, it actually drove a higher accrual for the incident compensation. So, to your point, we did have to go back and make that catch-up for the Q1 and Q2. So that's why you have an elevated expense in Q3. So, you know, all things being equal, we would not expect that same level of incentive compensation in Q4.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. So this is three quarters worth of accrual there. Okay.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah. If you look at the math or kind of compare it to the, you know, it's -- the prior quarter, it's probably up anywhere around between $10 million and $14 million versus the last quarter, so that just kind of gives you a little bit of ballpark. Now there was some adjustments in Q2, kind of a similar thing, to try to true up or be consistent with the outlook for the full year, but that's generally what you're going to come out with that range.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. On the securities portfolio, should we expect to continue to see around that $800 million per quarter cash flow range?", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yeah, currently at the moment that's right. I mean, as you know, we haven't really -- we haven't been adding to the investment securities portfolio. In fact, we've had some of the run-off in the investments ,we've been putting it back in to support our loan growth.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Right. Okay. And then finally for me, on the sponsor-led loan that improved, is that improved enough to move off of NPAs? Is that the one that you were speaking about that is -- has worked out? Or is this -- is there a potential for additional improvement in those handful of loans that are non-performing?", "Marc Cadieux", "Sure. So it's Marc. The one for which we had a reserve release, the way to think about this I think is there's day one of the turnaround and you don't know what's going to happen. And on the other end of the spectrum would be a loan that's just like any of the other good loans in our buyout portfolio where leverage levels are reasonable and they're able to service and full repay their debt within a reasonable period of time. We are on that journey. And for the one that we saw reserve release, we saw sufficient performance to their turnaround plan to support a partial reserve release.", "I'd still believe that there is at least another quarter or two that we would want to see of that continued progress before we would be in a place where we could say that restoring it to accrual and releasing the rest of the reserve, the specific reserve, is the appropriate thing to do.", "Jared Shaw - Wells Fargo Securities", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And then our next question comes from Aaron Deer of Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Hi, good afternoon everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Wanted to ask I guess going back to the guidance. The alternative guidance that you gave, Greg, with respect to net interest income under a higher rate scenario, you said mid-teens increase with rates up. What does that assume in rate hikes? Is that one hike, two hikes?", "Greg Becker", "So I'm going to go to Mike for the forward curve estimate, but it's 25 basis points assumed in December, and I'll have to ask him for what is assumed in the --", "Mike Descheneaux", "It's pretty much the assumption would be that there was a rate hike in December. That's the heavier lift. So the way to look at it, Aaron, is the number, when you think about it is, for every 25 basis points, roughly, using a static balance sheet as of the point in time, gives you about $28 million -- $25 million to $28 million of net income, bottom-line net income. That's kind of basic rule of thumb currently right now based on the profile of our balance sheet.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Right, okay. And then, on the -- going to the fee income. Client investment fees were flattish with the prior quarter, I guess that makes sense given that those balances really didn't move much. How sensitive are those fees to rate? So if we do get another 25 basis point hike in rates, is there going to be any benefit to the fees there?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg. I will start. So there'll be some benefit clearly, but it won't be much as a pickup as there with the first 25 basis points, partially because we basically were going from such a low number that it was in the 3, 4 basis points. So if you're growing up to 5, 6, 7 basis points on a percentage basis, that's a very big jump. If there's another 25 basis points that occurs or 50 basis points, it won't be the same percentage sharing, so maybe it's, you know, 1, 2 or 3 basis points. So, you know, clearly it will help, it'll help if there's more rate increases, but the big driver, once we get that first lift of a few basis points is going to come from growth in the off-balance-sheet.", "Aaron Deer - Sandler O'Neill", "Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Yes.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America.", "Ebrahim Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good afternoon guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Ebrahim.", "Ebrahim Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just had one question in terms of deposits. I wanted to get a sense, I think when I think about deposit growth, I guess one side is VC funding, which would give more clients more deposit growth, and the other is just sort of balancing -- sort of channeling deposits on balance sheet versus off-balance-sheet. When we think about sort of diverting deposits to the balance sheet, can you talk about just in terms of customer preference today? Are you seeing your early-stage clients having a bit more sensitivity to pick up that extra yield and stay off-balance-sheet, or should we see that then move as we look into fourth quarter into 2017?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Ebrahim, this is Greg. I'll start and Mike may want to add to it.", "So, deposits clearly are impacted by venture capital; that's one of the drivers. It's also, as you said, where the preference or the direction of the products that we actually have to offer. So at the early stage, right now we're looking at more of an on-balance-sheet, both checking account, money market account. And even though rates increased 25 basis points last December, there still is very little, I guess, desire to focus on what the yield actually is.", "The other part is you have to look at the whole relationship. It's not just what you're charging on the overall money market account but it is what services you're giving, what are you charging for those services. And from our standpoint, at the early stage, we have a very, very competitive bundle package. So it's not just one thing, you have to look at the whole thing overall.", "From a deposit perspective, again, as Mike articulated in his comments, we feel better about here we are. We think the decline is either stopped or definitely reduced, and that's what we're giving an outlook into 2017 that has some modest growth.", "Ebrahim Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. And I guess just a separate question, in terms of when we think about the sort of competitive environment and sort of the covenant structures in terms of lending to these early-stage companies, has it gotten better over the last 12 months in terms of sort of the warrants that you're getting as part of these relationships, or has it not really changed?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. I will -- I'll start. When I think about the competitive landscape, Ebrahim, it has been extremely competitive for the last several years and we expect it will continue to be competitive, as other markets, other industries clearly don't have the growth rate that technology market has. And that's part of our expectation. We've had that. We believe we get premium pricing in general because of the whole platform and what we provide and how we provide it. But it is competitive.", "When you think about warrant coverage or just pricing in general, I would say that it continues to be under pressure, and I would expect that it will continue to be that way for the foreseeable future.", "Ebrahim Poonawala - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "That's helpful. Thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Our next question is from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "On -- just a question back on credit. The on-the-spots or buyout portfolio, now that you're seeing some improvement in some of the credits that had surfaced in that portfolio, is your view there that that was still one-off type of issues that you were seeing and somewhat idiosyncratic, or was there a commonality at all that you can say at this point, now that you're seeing some of the issues abate, you know, that drove some of the problems you had in that portfolio?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, it is -- it's very much the first one. These were company-specific issues that resulted in each of them becoming non-performing, and by extension are not indicative of any broader or systemic trend in that segment of our portfolio.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. All right, thanks.", "And then on the same topic there on credit, are there portfolios that you would say you're watching closely, I guess? I just, you know, I would assume early-stage just given some of the color you gave in your prepared comments given the flows from the venture capital and private equity community into early stage, so that will clearly be one. But any other areas of the portfolio that you're watching closely in terms of credit?", "Greg Becker", "Sure. So I'd say first that we rigorously monitor the entirety of our loan portfolio. The ones that I think, to your point, that have gotten the most attention as they should and as they historically always have is the early stage segment. Certainly buyout continues to be an area of focus just because they are larger loans and we've seen some stress there in the form of the handful of non-performing loans. But having said that, continue to believe that credit quality of that segment of the portfolio is stable overall and don't see any signs of challenges elsewhere in the portfolio, hence, the reaffirmation of our guidance for 2017.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "And do you have non-performing ratios for -- by portfolio? Like, do you have what the non-performing ratio is for your early-stage book and then for the buyout book?", "Greg Becker", "We do not.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay. All right. And then lastly, if I could ask one more, on the -- back to the margin benefit question, the 25-basis-point hike, I heard you say it in terms of the net income benefit. What would that be in terms of your margin, if we did see a hike in December of 25 basis points, what would the margin be?", "Mike Descheneaux", "John, I don't have that right in front of me, but you can work out the math pretty easily. If I had one or two minutes I could probably do it, but it's baked into it, yeah.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Okay, that's fine. So we can use our typical math there, nothing else that impact that.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Yup, exactly, yeah. There's not a whole lot of rocket science there.", "John Pancari - Evercore ISI", "Yup. Okay. Good. Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris McGratty of CBW.", "Chris McGratty - KBW", "Close. Afternoon guys.", "Mike Descheneaux", "KBW.", "Greg Becker", "We know who you are, Chris.", "Chris McGratty - KBW", "Okay. Question on the VC book. It's about 40, you know, the capital call is pushing 40%. Obviously very low risk. What's the internal cap that we should be thinking about in terms of how large it'll be?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, Chris, this is Greg. There's a couple of ways to think about it. One is, as you said, it's roughly 40%, 39% of the overall loan portfolio, and it is incredibly high quality, which is why we're comfortable with it, clearly at this level, and comfortable with it going to a higher level.", "Another way to think about it is just the overall size of that relative to the assets of the overall bank, which gets you down to kind of that 17% to 19% range. Another way too look at it.", "And so, where could we end up watching this go to before we want to pay even more attention to it? To me, that number is kind of in the high 40s, maybe even approaching 50%. But at the same time, we're looking for growth in the other parts of the portfolio to include the private bank. And so that still allows for ample growth, from our standpoint, in the overall private equity services portfolio.", "Chris McGratty - KBW", "Okay. Great. Maybe a follow-up. Assuming the range and charge-offs next year, and based on kind of what you put in in the portfolio in terms of risk, you had been providing call it a 75, 90-basis-point range over the past few quarters because of the stress. Is there any reason why that proportion of provisioning shouldn't abate or converge closer to the charge-off rate next year?", "Greg Becker", "So this is Greg, Chris. When you think about the 30 to 50 basis points, that's for charge-offs. The overall loan provision is a function of that, reserves against loan, and also loan growth. And so if you go back and look at the provision part of the reason the number is higher, is because the loan growth has been so strong. And so I would extract from our guidance, the 30 to 50 basis points, that is again similar to this year and, depending upon what loan growth does, that would provide the higher level of what the provision would look like.", "Chris McGratty - KBW", "Okay. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Our next question is from David Long of Raymond James.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Hey guys.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Dave.", "David Long - Raymond James", "The one question I have remaining is regarding sponsor abandonments. You guys had given a number on that the last couple of quarters on your calls. Do you have a number for the third quarter the amount of sponsor abandonments that happened?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "By sponsor abandonment, do you mean --", "Mike Descheneaux", "VC abandonment, early stage?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right, but it's more of a --", "David Long - Raymond James", "Exactly.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "In the form of charge-offs or non-performing, is -- just maybe getting specific on what is [inaudible]?", "David Long - Raymond James", "Yeah, just, you know, Mike had talked about, in the past, about I think the first quarter the number was 15 basis points -- or not -- 15 companies, and then I want to say it was around 11 last quarter. I just wanted to see if that's still coming down here at this point.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Right. So, okay, that's -- thanks for that.", "So, yes, 15 companies in the first quarter. So here, just talking about charge-offs, it was 15 companies in the first quarter, 11 in the second quarter. It was 11 again in the third quarter, but to give you a little more color on that, there was, yeah, 9 of the 11 were in the very, very, very, very granular category. And so the early-stage charge-offs was about $6.3 million in third quarter versus $13.9 million in the second.", "Going to non-performing loans, which would be another, I'll say, you know, related to your abandonment question, the number of companies, the pace has been very steady over the course of this year, with the higher stress we saw in the first quarter being a function of a higher incident of NPLs, early-stage NPLs in the fourth quarter of 2015.", "David Long - Raymond James", "Got it. That's what I was looking for. Thank you.", "Unidentified Company Representative", "Great.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brett Rabatin of Piper Jaffray.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Hey, good afternoon. Wanted to ask, capital call lines of credit PE growth, you mentioned earlier in the call there could be some payoff activity there. Could you give us an idea of the magnitude of what you think might be potentially paying in that portfolio over the next year versus the pipeline?", "Marc Cadieux", "So I'll start. Greg or Mike might want to add.", "It is difficult to predict what the -- what payoff or, you know, utilization activity will be. Having said that, loan growth in the first half 2016 was assisted by some borrowings in the fourth quarter of 2015 that stayed outstanding, and we actually saw some significant repayment of the third quarter, which is one of the factors in the more muted loan growth.", "At the same time, in the third quarter, unfunded commitments increased by roundabout $800 million, the vast majority of which were capital call lines of credit. What we tend to see, when we book a new capital call line of credit is utilization within a one to two-quarter period. And so that would be, you know, an indicator, if you will, of why we would have some confidence in the loan growth outlook.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay. That's good color. And then the other thing I was just curious about was the expansion in San Francisco, can you maybe give us any color or thoughts around just how much of an initiative that will be and how much that adds to growth as you think about that for the next year or two?", "Greg Becker", "So, Brett, this is Greg. You know, we've been growing our presence up in San Francisco just based on the number of employees, because there's a lot more activity up there. There's also not just our client-facing teams but parts of our employee base in different areas that are also located up there. And so we've been very tight on our quarters up in San Francisco. So we're looking at the relocation just to provide future growth for the next, you know, many, many years. That's one point.", "Second point is, just taking an approach that we've done in more and more offices, which is a very open environment. So, actually, although the footprint is bigger, it effectively pretty much doubles our capacity for growth up in San Francisco. So that's a great market for us, not just from a client perspective but it's a great market for us to retain and attract employees, and we are kind of excited about the move coming up next year.", "Brett Rabatin - Piper Jaffray", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jennifer Demba of SunTrust.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thank you. Good evening.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Jennifer.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Just wondering if you can give us some color on possibly going in Germany and Canada, if you could just give us whatever color you can on that.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. It's Greg. Very early days in both markets, and as I said, obviously this is more or less just to give it a highlight at something we're pursuing, but it's early and obviously subject to regulatory approval both domestically and in those local markets. But, you know, so the question is really, why are we looking at those markets?", "Well, if you look at venture capital activity, then Germany, as an example, Germany is one of the strongest European economies from the venture capital activity. The other part we look at is not just how much -- how many early-stage companies or startups are there, but how many mid and later-stage companies are there, and again Germany ranks very high, nearly the highest in Europe. And we've had some request to lend money for a few buyouts and things like that in Germany based on sponsors that we know and trust and have worked with for a long period of time.", "So the market is attractive. And because of our success in the U.K., this allows us to look at that market as well. So we're just working on that right now.", "Canada is very, very similar. We've been pulled into Canada by again clients, innovation companies, for years, and quite honestly it's going to reach the critical mass that we believe it's something we need to consider opening up. Both of those offices, just to clarify, would more than likely be lending-only offices to allow us to have a very light footprint in both markets. But we're right now again in the exploratory stage and, if something were to happen, it really would be late 2017, into 2018, where you would really hear a lot more about it.", "Jennifer Demba - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey", "Thanks so much.", "Greg Becker", "Yes.", "Operator", "Thank you. And then our next question is from Chris York of JMP Securities.", "Chris York - JMP Securities", "Good evening guys and thanks for squeezing me in here.", "Greg Becker", "Yes.", "Chris York - JMP Securities", "Just one question. Just wanted to talk a little bit maybe about investment, as Greg talked again about strengthening the brand and investing in the platform. So, clearly, historically, PE has been a source of that investment, but maybe where else is that showing up? Is that in premises and equipment? And then, could you quantify how much you think the investment is in the non-interest expense and maybe how much that might be and your high single digit guidance in 2017?", "Greg Becker", "So, Chris, it's -- I wouldn't say that we're doing anything new. We continue to invest in both infrastructure, in client-facing roles, in geographic expansion, as I just outlined. So on a global basis, we continue to invest in the U.K. as that continues to expand, investing in Asia, investing potentially in Germany and Canada. So geographic is one area.", "The second area is just overall infrastructure. We need to continue to put money into our digital platform, our systems, infrastructure, the regulatory compliance, all those areas. So it is very difficult, I would say nearly impossible, to say, how much of that is investment for where we are today versus keeping up for growth. But clearly, the high single-digit growth and expense levels that we're forecasting for 2017 is not just for today, it is very much building for the future.", "Chris York - JMP Securities", "Yeah, makes sense, and that's fair enough. That's for me. Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Thanks, Chris.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jeffrey Elliott [ph].", "Unidentified Participant", "Hello. Thank you for taking the question. You've mentioned a few times the capital call loans being lower yield than the rest of the portfolio. Can you put numbers around that differential?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. This is Greg, I'll start. You know, when you look at capital call loans for private equity firms, you're looking at prime minus, I would say, half to maybe in that general range, with, you know, 25 to 50 basis points on either side of that range. So clearly it's lower-yielding than our overall loan portfolio, which is why the average loan yield is coming down mainly.", "But another point I just want to make sure, this is really important, is that when you look at it, the reason that we're comfortable doing that from a return on capital perspective is the fact that the overall credit quality of that portfolio has been exceptional, and we certainly expect that we needed to be exceptional for the foreseeable future. It's a big market, we have a, you know, very strong competitive advantage, and so we still expect that to see nice growth.", "Unidentified Participant", "And then just to follow up, you sound pretty positive on the growth outlook there. What sort of environment would it take for the capital call loans to (stop) growing?", "Greg Becker", "It's an interesting question because you have to look at it in two different ways, and Marc Cadieux would say that again the vast majority of that portfolio now is in broad-based private equity, so it's a little bit less depending upon what I would say is the innovation economy or the tech industry overall. That being said, it is susceptible to the market overall and activities around the globe, but it's kind of funny in the sense of, in one way, it can be impacted negatively to existing companies, but their willingness to put more money to work actually is a function of the price of what they're going into. And so if the economy starts to slow, some of them actually look at the market as being a great time to be in the market.", "A great example of that is what you see in the U.K. So over the last six months you can look at what's happened with the pound to dollar ratio. So we're seeing a lot of --", "Unidentified Participant", "I know it well.", "Greg Becker", "-- private equity firms coming in and actually looking at that as a good opportunity, roughly 20%, 25% discount.", "Unidentified Participant", "Thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Gary Tenner of D.A. Davidson.", "Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson", "Thanks. Just a quick question regarding your loan portfolio, kind of rate orientation towards LIBOR phase [ph] loans. Was there any impact this quarter? Is there any lag of the move in LIBOR that would impact the fourth quarter and beyond?", "Marc Cadieux", "So, maybe just to give you a little bit of color, first, the answer would be it's very modest. The second answer, so, about 88% of our portfolio is floating rate versus fixed rate and it's about 60% tied to prime versus 40% LIBOR.", "Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. And would there be any just a lag in terms of the impact to where there wouldn't have been much 3Q, maybe more in 4Q?", "Mike Descheneaux", "So maybe one other thing to add on there is, certain parts of our portfolios do have floors, roughly around 100 basis points of LIBOR, you know, partake [ph] in the sponsor buyout portfolio, which is roughly about $2 billion of our loan portfolio. So that'll put some hesitation. And then you've got the 30, 60, 90, one-year type LIBOR [inaudible] reset. So that's why, as Marc described it, it's actually quite a modest thing. But once we do break through a floor of 100, then we would start to see more of that impact.", "Gary Tenner - D.A. Davidson", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Tyler Stafford of Stephens, Inc.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon guys. Just one last one for me. Meghan, apologize for taking this over the hour.", "Greg Becker", "That's quite all right, Tyler.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Do you have the global loan and deposit balances at quarter-end, and any change in those and either of those call it from pre-Brexit?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, this is Greg. So when you look at it in dollar terms, actually has changed a little bit, but not much, which is interesting, because the -- if you looked at it on constant dollar terms, you would have seen roughly a 15% growth rate. And so, flatness [ph] may appear not to be a great number. We look at it as a positive and clearly hope that the pound to dollar has stabilized.", "Tyler Stafford - Stephens, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And that is all the time we have for our questions today. I'll turn the call back to Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Thanks. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We had a great quarter that we are extremely proud of and an outlook that we expect to continue to drive solid growth into 2017.", "I want to thank all our employees again for doing such a great job in taking care of our clients, and for our clients, again, as always, putting their trust in us. We don't take that trust lightly.", "And I also have a special thanks, this is my close. Today I just want to do a special shout-out to Joe Morford. Joe has been an analyst that's covered Silicon Valley Bank for the last 24 years, pretty much my entire tenure at Silicon Valley Bank. He recently stepped down from RBS. And I just wanted to say, Joe -- RBC -- sorry, Joe, I just wanted to say, thanks, Joe, for all the great work over the years, and best wishes for whatever your next step in your career is.", "Mike Descheneaux", "Hear, hear.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Adrian and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we\u2019ll conduct a looking at question-and-answer session. Please note this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Meghan O'Leary, Head of Investor Relations. Meghan O'Leary, please go ahead.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Adrian. And thanks everyone for joining us today Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, are here to talk about our fourth quarter 2016 and full year 2016 results, and they\u2019ll be joined by other members of the management team for a Q&A.", "Our currently earnings release is available on the investor relations section of the website at svb.com.", "We will be making some forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release.", "Our comments are a little bit longer today give that it\u2019s end of year and we made our announcement about two hours ago. So, we still plan to limit the call including Q&A to an hour, so bear with us please.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Great. Good afternoon and thank everyone for joining us today. Our fourth quarter was a strong finish to a very good year. We delivered earnings per share of $1.89 and net income of $99.5 million, with healthy loan growth, total funds growth and core fee income growth and stable credit quality.", "For the full year 2016, we delivered earnings per share of $7.31 versus $6.62 in 2015 and grew net income by 11% to $383 million.", "I\u2019ll going into the details of the year and our expectations for 2017 in a moment. But I\u2019d like to start by addressing the announcement we made earlier today. That is, our plans to appoint our CFO, Mike Descheneaux, as president of Silicon Valley Bank. I\u2019m excited about this move because it's about growth. As many of you know, in the past decade, SVB has grown nearly every aspect of our business. Our balance sheet, client base, capabilities and global reach, not to mention our employee base.", "We have many more growth opportunities ahead, but we need to evolve our organization to better support that growth. In Mike's new role, he will be responsible for our global, commercial banking, private banking, funds management strategies, and for uniting our broader banking team around our shared vision and a clear set of priorities. Ultimately, I believe this move will enable us to better leverage the power of the SVB platform, including our insights and analytics, to help our clients succeed.", "As president CEO of SVB Financial Group, I will continue to oversee all aspects of our corporate strategy, vision, mission goals and objectives. I believe \u2013 and our Board believes \u2013 that Mike is the perfect choice for this role. In his almost ten years at SVB, he has proven to be an effective leader, a strong partner, a skilled communicator, and a valuable member of our executive team. He understands our business and our clients and he's passionate about what we do.", "Michael will take over his new role as president once we've identified and hired a new CFO. That search is currently underway. Until then, Mike will remain as our CFO.", "And now, I\u2019d like to talk about our 2016 performance and milestones, our focus in the environment as we move into 2017. After that, Mike will go into the details of the quarter.", "I'm proud of our continued success in 2016. I\u2019d like to touch on a few highlights. We grew average loans by 24% to $18.3 billion. We grew average total client funds by 9% to $82.1 billion. We increased net interest income by 14% to $1.2 billion. We grew core fee income by 19% to $316 million. We maintained good credit quality overall, consistent with our overall guidance. Our expenses increased by 12%. This was above our outlook range, but the excess was primarily due to higher incentive compensation related to our outperformance. And finally, we delivered a solid return on average equity of 10.9% despite low rates and continued investment in our business.", "The strong financial performance was underscored by numerous business milestones and incremental improvements, evidence of our consistent focus on effective execution. For instance, we continued to add new clients at a healthy pace. We expanded our net client count by 16%. This reflected growth across most of our client segments, particularly in private equity and the private bank, as well as 26% growth in the UK and Europe.", "We maintained our leading market share of early-stage companies and grew our early-stage client count by 13%. We expanded our US and global reach in various markets to support growth. This included expansion of our offices in San Francisco and London, as well as a number of smaller US markets. Establishment of a beachhead in Dublin, Ireland. And the first steps towards establishing a physical presence in Germany and Canada, pending regulatory approval.", "We saw continued growth and momentum from our payments initiatives. Fees from our foreign exchange and credit card lines grew by 20% in 2016 and FX revenues exceeded $100 million for the first time. We closed approximately 3,800 new cash management, card and merchant service deals in 2016. We also crossed the $3 billion threshold for client credit card spend and $5 billion threshold for total card volume.", "We continued to enhance our payment capabilities, platform and reach through partnerships. One of the most significant of these partnerships is with First Data, who\u2019s industry-leading platform enables our clients to make and receive payments on any platform globally.", "And we reached a significant milestone in 2016, processing more than $1 trillion of payments. And that compares to $880 billion in 2015.", "Finally, we received a healthy amount of external recognition in 2016, but I\u2019d like to call out two distinctions. Our strong performance put us on the Forbes\u2019 best banks list for the eighth year running. And in one of the acknowledgements of which I'm most proud, we were included in Forbes\u2019 first ever Just 100 list, one of only three banks on the list. This list is effectively a ranking of corporate integrity. I'm most proud of this recognition because it highlights our commitment to achieving success in a way that's consistent with our corporate values.", "As we look into 2017, we believe there are a lot of reasons to be positive. We are optimistic that 2017 will be a stronger year for VC investment and exits in 2016. If 2015 was the year of funding and 2016 was the year of recalibration, we believe 2017 has the potential to be the year of liquidity. While the VC market recalibration of 2016 created many challenges for early-stage companies, VC investing still remained near all-time highs, with $69 billion invested in more than 7,000 companies. We believe the recalibration was a healthy adjustment overall, signaling a return to a more normal pace of VC investment in 2017.", "Fundraising remained extremely strong in 2016 despite the investment pull back as VCs raised $41.6 billion, the highest amount in a decade. Clearly, VCs will have a lot of capital to deploy in 2017, although later stage startups may continue to attract the lion\u2019s share of investment at the expense of early-stage companies.", "As we enter into 2017, the exit markets are looking promising. In addition to the 20 or so venture-backed companies that are formally registered for IPOs, we are aware of a growing pipeline of other companies that have file confidentially or are planning to file for an IPO.", "While the exit markets could remain somewhat challenging, especially for companies with high valuations, the mood has markedly improved over last year, helped by solid performance of companies that went public in the second half of 2016 and greater confidence since the US election.", "On the M&A front, we believe corporate tax reform could provide additional liquidity that could drive better M&A activity in 2017.", "Turning to the broader economic landscape, strengthening US economy and a steeping yield curve suggests an improving growth picture in 2017. Recent short-term increases in interest rates and higher interest rates implied by the forward curve will benefit asset-sensitive banks. And few banks are more asset sensitive than SVB. ", "While it is too early to know what policies the new administration will enact, it is widely expected the corporate tax rates will fall and certain regulatory requirements impacting banks may be relaxed. And general activity since the election suggests the markets expect the new administration will be good for US businesses.", "For SVB specifically, our clients as a whole have tended to perform well through good and bad markets. We expect that trend to continue. We believe improving business conditions and exit markets will drive more new company formation and investment. In addition, the potential repatriation of an estimated $2.5 trillion that American companies are currently holding overseas could significantly increase liquidity for acquisitions and investments.", "With these conditions in mind, we see potential upside to our initial full year 2017 outlook. In addition, we\u2019re increasing our outlook for net interest income and core fee income due to the expected impact of December\u2019s rate increase.", "While we are optimistic about year ahead, we will face challenges. Global market volatility and uncertainty continue to affect our clients. In addition, it is unclear how the new administration's trade and tax policies will affect our clients that do business globally. Competition for us remains intense and we believe it's here to stay.", "And while we believe we have passed through the most significant impacts of last year's market recalibration, many of our early-stage clients are still feeling its effects on access to capital and valuations. In addition, elevated M&A activity among our clients continues to present a headwind to a higher rate of loan growth.", "We believe these challenges are manageable, however, and we remain optimistic about the resilience and the power of the innovation ecosystem. Our innovation clients continue to perform well overall and remain active regardless of short-term market bumps. Our unique place in the innovation ecosystem, our reputation, relationships, experience and insight gives us significant advantage in winning and keeping the best clients and helping them succeed.", "We see continued opportunities for growth and expansion in 2017 and remain focused on our long-term priorities of enhancing our client relationships and building our brand, expanding our platform capabilities and reach, and strengthening risk management to help support our growth.", "We have consistently demonstrated our ability to execute effectively under a variety of market conditions, aligning ourselves with the best companies and investors over the long-term. We have a long history of disciplined growth and now, more than ever, we remain focused on delivering high-quality growth and strong returns that we can sustain over the long-term.", "Our unique culture and place in the innovation economy remain key factors in our ability to attract and retain the very best employees, whose mission is to support our remarkable clients and increase their probability to success.", "Thank you. And now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Mike Descheneaux.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thanks, Greg, and good afternoon everyone. Let me get right into the quarter. I plan to highlight the following items in my comments. First, healthy loan growth across the portfolio with continued strength in private equity and the private bank; second, strong total client funds growth; third, higher net interest income despite a slightly lower net interest margin; fourth, stable credit quality; fifth, solid core fee income growth; and sixth, higher expenses. Additionally, I will comment on our capital ratios and provide details on our 2017 outlook, which has improved somewhat from our preliminary outlook in October.", "Starting with loans, average loans grew by $614 million or 3.3% to $19.3 billion, driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and the private bank. Strong period-end loan growth of $788 million or 4.1% was driven primarily by private equity, early-stage and sponsored buyout and points to healthy momentum as we enter 2017.", "Moving to total client funds \u2013 that is, combined on-balance sheet deposits and off-balance-sheet client investment funds \u2013 we saw a return to growth in the fourth quarter due to a combination of increased funding rounds and new client acquisition.", "Average total client funds grew $3.7 billion or 4.5% to $84.7 billion in the fourth quarter. This reflected strong average deposit growth of $1.8 billion or 4.7% due to cash inflows from growth stage clients tied to new funding and from our private equity and venture capital clients despite some seasonal outflows related to year-end distributions.", "It also reflected average client investment funds growth of $1.9 billion or 4.3%, primarily as a result of higher balances from our growth stage and corporate finance clients due to capital raising activity.", "Turning now to net interest income and our net interest margin. Net interest income increased by $7.4 million to $296.6 million in the fourth quarter. Higher average loan balances drove this increase, along with a benefit of $1.6 million from December's Fed fund increase, which was consistent with what we would have expected from the rate increase.", "Additionally, we saw an increase of $2.4 million in interest income from fixed income securities. The increase was primarily due to a $4.7 million change in premium amortization expense from Q3 to Q4 as a result of changes to prepayment estimates following the increase in market interest rates in the fourth quarter.", "Our net interest margin decreased by 2 basis points to 2.73% due to a higher average balances of cash and short-term investment securities, our lowest yielding asset.", "Now, let us move to credit quality, which remained stable overall. Our allowance for loan losses was $225.4 million at the end of the fourth quarter or 1.13% of total gross loans, an overall decrease of $15.2 million or 12 basis points compared to the third quarter. We recorded a loan loss provision of $7.1 million compared to $19 million in the third quarter. Our provision primary reflects $14.3 million in specific reserves for net new non-accrual loans and $6.5 million for loan growth. These additions were partially offset by a $5.8 million net reduction in reserves for performing loans.", "In addition, we also made certain enhancements during the quarter to our methodology for determining our allowance for loan losses and our reserve for unfunded loan commitments. The results were a $7.9 million decrease in the allowance for loan losses, which is reflected as part of our provision for loan losses, and an $8.1 million increase in our reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which is recorded in non-interest expense. The net impact of these two enhancements had a minimal impact on overall net income for the quarter.", "Given that our press release has a significant amount of detail in the various components of credit quality, I will limit my comments primarily to the quarter-to-quarter change in certain components and refer you to our press release for additional details.", "Net charge-offs were lower at $21.3 million or 44 basis points in the fourth quarter compared to $22.5 million or 48 basis points in the third quarter. I would note that the majority of our net charge-offs were previously reserved for and, therefore, had no significant impact on the provision for the quarter.", "Non-performing loans increased by $12.8 million to $119 million or 59 basis points compared to $106.2 million or 55 basis points in the third quarter.", "Now, I would turn to non-interest income, which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and PE and VC-related investment securities. I will discuss certain non-GAAP measures in my comments and we encourage you to refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations in our press release for further detail.", "GAAP non-interest income was $113.5 million compared to $144.1 million in the third quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest, was $109.1 million compared to $139.5 million in the third quarter. The decrease was mainly related to lower net gains on investment securities and warrants relative to Q3, which was exceptional. These lower PE and VC-related gains were offset somewhat by higher core fee income. ", "Let me review the components. First, non-GAAP net gains, net of non-controlling interests, on investment securities of $5.3 million compared to $18.4 million in the third quarter. These gains were driven primarily by distributions from our VC fund investments.", "Second, net gains of $4.6 million on equity warrant assets primarily related to valuation increases during the quarter. This compares to warrant gains of $21.6 million in the third quarter related to improving exit markets and Acacia\u2019s IPO.", "Combined non-GAAP investment securities and warrant gains were $9.9 million. This number is net of two notable items, totaling $5.7 million, which includes a $2.8 million one-time write down on a strategic investment and a $2.9 million decline in the value of our Acacia holdings, which you will recall was the primary driver of third quarter's outstanding warrant gains.", "Moving on to core fee income, which includes fee from foreign exchange, credit cards, deposit service charges, lending-related activities, letters of credit and client investment funds. Core fee income increased $4.1 million or 5.1% to $84.6 million in the fourth quarter. This increase was driven primarily by higher foreign exchange and lending-related fee income.", "Income from foreign exchange fees increased by $1.2 million or 4.8% to $27.2 million. This increase was due to more clients actively managing their currency exposure as a result of volatility in global currency markets, something we have seen now for several quarters running.", "Lending-related fees increased $1.4 million or 17.7% to $9.6 million, primarily as a result of higher syndication fee income related to one particularly large deal.", "In general, we continue to see solid growth across most fee income lines.", "Moving on to expenses, non-interest expense increased by $22.8 million or 10% to $244.6 million in the fourth quarter. This increase consisted of several components. An increase in our provision for unfunded credit commitments of $8.3 million due to enhancements to our reserve for unfunded credit commitments, which I mentioned earlier, and $3.3 million in additional compensation and benefits expense. The most notable component of this increase was a $5.5 million increase related to compensation programs based on our stock price, which increased approximately 57% in the quarter.", "I would also like to call your attention to our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, which was 35.5%, a decrease from the prior quarter and our usual rate of approximately 40%. This decrease was due to adjustments to our deferred tax balances. We expect our effective tax rate going forth to remain in the 40% range.", "Turning to capital. Our capital position remains healthy overall due to solid earnings. As you'll see in the press release, deposit and loan growth during the quarter drove average assets and risk-weighted assets higher. This had the effect of decreasing our bank level Tier 1 capital ratio by 7 basis points, although at 7.67% it still remains strong. We also saw a 12 basis point decline in our bank level risk-based capital ratios due to loan growth.", "Now, I\u2019d like to discuss our 2017 outlook and provide some updates to the preliminary outlook we provided in October. This outlook is for the full year 2017 versus the full year 2016. Balance sheet growth rates are based on full-year averages, not quarterly averages. Additionally, our outlook reflects the impact of the 25 basis point Fed funds increase we saw in December, but assumes no further rate increases in 2017. If there are rate increases in 2017, we will adjust our outlook accordingly. As a reminder, this outlook is based on our current forecast and assumptions about market conditions and is subject to change.", "Starting with loans, consistent with our commentary in October, we expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens, with the strongest growth expected to come from private equity and the private bank. We expect average deposit balances to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-to high single digits, which is consistent with our outlook in October.", "We expect net interest income to grow at a percentage rate in the low teens and increase over our preliminary outlook of low-double-digits growth. We expect our net interest margin to be between 2.8% and 3%, which has been helped with the recent increases in rates.", "We expect credit quality to remain stable and comparable to 2016 levels. Specifically, we expect net loan charge-offs to range between 30 and 50 basis points of average total gross loans. We expect non-performing loans to range between 50 and 70 basis points of total gross loans and we expect our allowance for loan losses for performing loans to be comparable to 2016 levels. It is important to know that although we expect continued good credit performance in 2017, we could see credit metrics trend toward the higher end of our outlook ranges if our investor-dependent clients continue to see an impact from the 2016 recalibration.", "We are improving our outlook for core fee income and now expect to grow at a percentage rate in the high teens. This primarily reflects the impact of December\u2019s rate increase on our client investment fees. We expect non-interest expense to increase at a percentage rate in the high single digits, consistent with our preliminary outlook. Keep in mind that if we outperform on our financial metrics, we could see higher incentive compensation, which would drive a higher rate of expense growth.", "Finally, while we do not provide an outlook for warrant and investment gains, we believe venture investment levels, trends in funding rounds and the pace of M&A and IPOs in 2017 will all remain key factors to our overall earnings performance.", "In closing, we had a strong finish to a solid year. Our outlook for 2017 is positive and has improved somewhat since our preliminary outlook in October as a result of December\u2019s very welcome increase in short-term rates. Our clients remain healthy overall and we are seeing higher confidence in exit market prospects for 2017.", "While competition, economic uncertainty and global market volatility persists, we remain focused on delivering the right kind of growth, maintaining stable credit quality and succeeding in the long-term. We see solid momentum across our business and we believe we are well-positioned for 2017.", "Finally, I want to comment on our announcement that I will be taking on the role of President of Silicon Valley Bank. We have a fantastic banking team and I am looking forward to working more closely with them to support our clients and grow our business. ", "For now, I remain focused on my role as CFO, but I'm excited about the future, specifically about the opportunity to harness the power of our platform as we grow to become an even stronger partner to our clients and retain our position as the bank of choice for innovators and their investors.", "Thank you. And now, I will ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Great, thank you. Good evening.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Ken.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Question, in terms of \u2013 obviously, the deposit growth that you\u2019re seeing, right, so it\u2019s a bit stronger than what we were expecting, certainly increases the asset size faster. As you guys approach the SIFI buffer, right, and let's assume that the SIFI threshold is actually unchanged at $50 billion, does that accelerate your plans for getting ready for becoming SIFIite, specifically in terms of higher expenses? Because I think you mentioned a little bit about high regulatory expenses in this quarter\u2019s results, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of the magnitude of change there.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Ken. This is Greg. I\u2019ll start and I\u2019m sure Mike will want to add. We did see nice deposit growth in the fourth quarter. We expect, as our outlook says, that deposit growth will continue, although not at the pace that we saw back in 2015. So, the timing, again, of hitting a higher threshold of $50 billion level is still a little bit in the distance. We\u2019re not slowing anything down. We continue to invest as if that $50 billion hurdle will be there and unchanged. Obviously, we\u2019re hopeful it changes. We\u2019re hopeful there's more flexibility. But at this point, we are not definitely not banking on it.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Got you, okay. And then, if people have used the forward curve in their models, which we do, I think last quarter you mentioned what NII would be up if we applied the forward curve, has that changed? Can you just give \u2013 I don\u2019t know \u2013 a potential range?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, Ken, we will come out with the updated sensitivity charts. But, generally, as you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of quarters, for every one basis point increase in the rates, again across the board, what you will see is approximately a little bit more than $1 million benefit to net income. That\u2019s after-tax. So, you can kind of gross it up a little bit to get to your net interest income number. So that\u2019s generally the rule of thumb. And again, we will run the numbers in the model and publish it in our 10-Q here in the next couple of weeks \u2013 sorry, the 10-K.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Got it, okay. And then, really last question. Do you guys \u2013 in terms of the higher expenses, do you actually link incentive compensation to the benefit that you get in NII directly from interest rates?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, we have traditionally and historically been neutralizing that out of the equation for us. So, for example, in 2017 \u2013 sorry, 2018, as we go forward, if we have a lift in the interest rate, we would normalize that out and not necessarily drive a benefit from incentive compensation levels.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Okay, great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawalla from Bank of America. Please go ahead.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Good afternoon, guys. Ebrahim here.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, Ebrahim.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Greg, if you can start out in terms of thinking about asset growth, you talked about private equity, capital call lines and private bank are expected to drive growth, how should we think about the asset mix as we look into 1Q and 2017? Do you expect a considerable change between securities and loans and then within the loan portfolio or should it be more or less where we were in the fourth quarter?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. So, if you look at just in assets [indiscernible] deposits first, then we will convert that into assets. The deposit growth we had in the fourth quarter was very strong. It probably won't be that strong on a quarterly basis, but obviously we expect growth to occur. It\u2019s going to be, I would say, pretty much in line in parity, when you look at the two together in general from growth perspective of loans matching the deposit growth. So, there probably won't be a big change in the investment securities portfolio overall. That being said, we do have investment securities that are maturing and cash flow coming and we\u2019re able to reinvest that at higher rates, which obviously we are excited about. And if we get higher rates on the lending side through increasing Fed funds rates, we get a benefit there. So, it\u2019s really on both sides of the asset side we hope to benefit.", "But from a growth perspective, I think, again, parity of deposit growth is going to match, generally speaking, the loan growth.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Understood. The thing to reconcile sort of when I think about your deposit guidance from mid to high single digits, with a spread revenue guidance for a low teens, so I\u2019m assuming mid to high single digits is deposit growth and then the rest of that is the margin expansion, which is baked into your guidance of 3.20% to 3.4% \u2013 2.80% to 3%, I mean.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yeah, that\u2019s right. So, the net interest margin outlook we gave you, it does consider the Fed funds increase here in December. So, that's why you're seeing a bit of an increase going into 2017 here.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Okay, got it. And just in terms of \u2013 Greg, you mentioned tax reforms in your opening remarks, one, like if you can remind us the last time there was some foreign cash repatriation, sort of what impact that had on your business in terms of customer activity. And secondly, if we get any changes to interest expense, tax deductibility, like, does that impact how you think about the PE capital call line business or is it too soon to really think about that before we get any details on the tax reform bill?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. So, two points, Ebrahim. One is, I can\u2019t recall that far back when we actually got the change in the repatriation. So, I actually can\u2019t off the top of my head remember exactly what the impact was. Do I believe it\u2019s a big impact? The only place where it has a potential for an impact is from an M&A perspective. If a lot more cash comes back in, could you see more M&A from larger corporations as they now are flush with a lot of liquidity and now they\u2019re going to be willing to put that for growth, that\u2019s clearly a possibility. But bottom line, any of the performs quite honestly that we \u2013 that\u2019s being talked about in the news, it's way too early to tell. My guess is there really won't be a lot of clarity on it for the next six to nine months at the earliest. We\u2019re, obviously, paying attention to it. I know everyone else will be as well and we\u2019re hopeful, but it's just too early to tell.", "Ebrahim Poonawalla", "Thanks for taking my questions.", "Greg Becker", "Yup, absolutely.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Hi, everybody. First, congratulations, Mike, to you. That\u2019s great news.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "First question on expenses. In 2016, expenses were up about 12%, right? So, that\u2019s above the original high single digit guidance. For 2017, you're still looking at the same high single digit range, but from a higher base in 2016. So, effectively, you're raising the forecast for expenses for 2017. What's driving this? Is this infrastructure, regulatory compliance? Thanks.", "Michael Descheneaux", "There\u2019s a few things to think about, Steve. And we tried to highlight some of these notable items in Q4, but, clearly, you're right, we gave the outlook for our 2017. But let me just kind of remind us of some of these notable items in the expenses there. You may have heard in the remarks where we increased our provision for unfunded credit commitments and that amounted to around $8.3 million. And that in itself is like 1% of the total expenses for the entire year. So, that\u2019s quite a sizable item. The other item we point out in expenses was $5.5 million incentive compensation increase related to our stock price increase. We do have incentive compensation for certain leaders in this organization that are tied to the stock price and you saw just the unusual, dramatic lift in stock prices, in particular our stock price here in the fourth quarter. So, when we look at those two items alone, those aren\u2019t something that you would expect to see every single quarter, and so as you enter into 2017, we would not necessarily expect to see those in 2017. So, hence we get a little bit of \u2013 I would say, a little bit of a breather there. But those two items in itself drove a significant amount of expenses. Clearly, we are spending from the regulatory front, clearly, we\u2019re expanding on the infrastructure front and for our clients and products. We are a rapidly growing bank. We\u2019re expanding internationally. So, there's just a lot of things going on that you would expect from a growth company.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, that\u2019s fair. On the loan growth, you guys had really strong growth in the capital calls under $20 million, which were more typically VC. I was surprise to see that given VC investment was down in the quarter. Give some color there. Are you seeing more optimism out of VCs in terms of putting capital to work?", "Greg Becker", "Steve, this is Greg. I will start. I wouldn't read anything into that as far as giving indication of how much venture capital, how much private equity. We still have some private equity firms that will make capital calls that are on the smaller side. Yes, some of them are larger, but it's also common to see some of them do some smaller draws at the end of the year. So, it's \u2013 I would say wouldn't read anything into it. On the venture capital side, in my comments, I talked about what we're hopeful for and kind of the outlook for 2017. And here\u2019s kind of the storyline behind it, right? There is a lot of companies that are keyed up to go \u2013 either go public or be acquired. And a lot of times, that gives more validation to valuations, right? It\u2019s the market clearing price. Then you start to see this big pool of money that\u2019s a little bit sitting on the sidelines come into those other companies that they believe may be similar to have the exit potential. So, our belief is the exits that we\u2019ll be seeing will help to create demand for more money to be deployed into these companies. So, that\u2019s where our optimism comes from. And that\u2019s \u2013 again, that\u2019s just what our outlook shows into 2017.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. Thanks. Maybe if I could squeeze one more in. On the client funds, you had really strong growth in the off-balance-sheet product this quarter. Is this tied to the rate opportunity improving there or you\u2019re just seeing more demand for off-balance-sheet than on-balance-sheet?", "Greg Becker", "Steve, this is Greg again. I would argue it's just \u2013 that\u2019s a one quarter event and we haven't seen it be a trend yet. And so, I think it truly is just a \u2013 the mix that occurred in the quarter, nothing really being driven on our part or the clients\u2019 part, it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s where it ended up at the end of the day. As we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our view is we would love to see a balance between when deposits or client funds come, but it\u2019s roughly 50% off-balance-sheet, 50% on-balance-sheet, and that\u2019s kind of what our goal remains. And so, quarter-to-quarter, you may see swings. But when you net things out, that\u2019s kind of what we\u2019re driving towards.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. Thanks for all the color.", "Greg Becker", "Yeah. You\u2019re welcome, Steve.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Good afternoon.", "Greg Becker", "Hey, John.", "John Pancari", "And, Mike, congratulations on the change.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, John.", "John Pancari", "On the expense topic again, just \u2013 I hear you how you describe the expense trends going into next year and the investments that you\u2019re still making, can you just give us how you\u2019re thinking about the efficiency ratio and where do you think that could come in for the year, given that you\u2019ve had the changes around the provisioning for the unfunded and I\u2019m not sure how that impacts \u2013 how we should think about efficiency in the ratio of an annual basis. Thanks.", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, I think the best starting point for you is to start with the expense growth outlook that we say, which is the high single digits. And you can certainly work back into the efficiency ratio. You\u2019ve seen here over the last couple of years \u2013 where do we finish the quarter? Something around 54%, 55%, somewhere in there. You can see that downward trend overall on our expense basis. So I think that\u2019s probably your just best point, John, to really start with, is just the expense outlook, then work itself in. We continue to be focused on the efficiency ratio. But, again, we know we\u2019ve got a fine balance between trying to maintain the growth. So, there\u2019s definitely a lot of tension there and there\u2019s certainly without a doubt pressure on expenses, but one that we\u2019re very, very focused on. And, certainly, the things around continuing to spend on the regulatory front will just continue. It\u2019s just a fact of life here for a while unless the government does something that kind of changes that trend.", "John Pancari", "Okay. All right. Thanks, Mike. On the Fed hike topic, could you just quantify how much did the hike in December benefit your loan yield and your NIM in isolation?", "Michael Descheneaux", "John, I haven't gone and worked out the math. I think the very simple rules \u2013 and you guys can actually work it out when you look at the disclosures in the 10-Q and 10-K. The simple rule of thumb is every basis point increase in those short-term rates will have a benefit after-tax of a little bit over $1 million. I think that\u2019s probably the best way for you to look at that. It's been holding true for probably the last several quarters and that\u2019s probably your best guide. As I\u2019ve mentioned earlier, we\u2019ll come out with kind of the updated sensitivities there, which does change quarter to quarter slightly, but for the most part it's been fairly consistent for the last several quarters.", "John Pancari", "Okay, all right. And then lastly, on the loan growth outlook, can you just give us a little bit more color on the mix of the growth through 2017? Where do you think the bulk of that could come from?", "Greg Becker", "Yeah, John. This is Greg. I\u2019ll start and Marc may want to add something. If you break this down, right, so it\u2019s a private equity venture capital, the capital call loans continue to be just such a great opportunity and I know we talked about this on, obviously, the last several quarters, but it just continues to be a great place for us to \u2013 with low risk, bring in some high-quality lending. That\u2019s number one. Private bank will be the next area again. Even when rates start to pick back up, we believe we've only really scratched the surface with our client base, and so there's upside with the private bank there and that's in mortgages and also there are private loans. And then, if you take those two as the biggest drivers, the rest is really across the board, whether it\u2019s life-sciences or global business, asset-based lending and our tech portfolio, sponsor-led buyout, you kind of see what we believe is consistent, albeit smaller growth across all those areas.", "John Pancari", "Okay, great. All right, thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Aaron Deer from Sandler O'Neill.", "Aaron Deer", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer", "A question on the growth outlook. In years past, you\u2019ve had a certain amount of seasonality that comes in at the end of the year and sometimes it's paid off quickly and sometimes it's delayed. As you look at the mix of growth that you had in the back half of the year, how do you expect the paydowns of some of those to play out over the first couple of quarters here?", "Marc Cadieux", "So, this is Marc Cadieux. It\u2019s always a little challenging to predict, the borrowing and repayment outlook for our private equity borrowers. I think having said that, the sense is that there's going to be the potential at least for strong activity in 2017 and thus continued borrowings on capital call lines of credit.", "Greg Becker", "But I think, Aaron, we didn't see the big run-up that we had in 2015. If you recall, we had, very late in the quarter, a very, very large run-up. We didn\u2019t see that this year. So, it was a more of a steady growth, and so we don't expect a big decline right out of the gate in 2017. So, it should be a lot more smooth.", "Aaron Deer", "Sure. Okay. And then, Mike, following up, I guess, on one of the earlier questions with respect to the expenses, you highlighted a couple of the more kind of non-recurring or one-time items in the fourth quarter that boosted the overall number for the year, but the guidance that you're giving is still off the \u2013 that total base, right?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, the guidance we\u2019re giving is off the total expense base for the entire year 2016. That's correct.", "Aaron Deer", "So, is it your expectation then that there could be other similar \u2013 we could continue to see any sort of outsized either provisions, unfunded commitments or additional compensation for stock-related comp or what are your thoughts there?", "Michael Descheneaux", "No, I think those two were, I think, notable as we characterized them as well. So, again, unless you really expect our stock price to run up another 50% here in such short a period of time, it\u2019s just unlikely you would have any real material amount that\u2019s going to be driving that here in 2017. So, no, it got capped out quite a bit with this nice run. Similarly, on the provision front for unfunded commitments, we just made some refinement and enhancement to the methodologies. So, again, we have no real plans necessarily to have another change like that to drive that. So, I think, at this point, I would say, I don't see those types of things being recurring in 2017.", "Now, the one other thing to think about as we go into 2017 is we reset our incentive compensation level targets. So, because 2016 was such a strong year, the incentive compensation pool that we pay out was much higher than the initial target as we go into the year. So, that resets back to our 1x factor, so to speak. So, when you're going into almost like Q1 of this quarter, you could expenses potentially going down versus the Q4. Again, so things just reset and recalibrate. So, that might be where some people may be struggling with kind of \u2013 you\u2019re at that run rate in Q4. I see you building off of that, but the reality is you\u2019re going to have some benefits and takeaways going into Q1. We\u2019re kind of starting at a lower base in Q1. So, hopefully, that helps.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. The first quarter usually does have, what, like $10 million or so in outsized comp related to FICA and such?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yes. So, those will be certainly seasonal expenses. I don\u2019t know if it would be quite $10 million, but you\u2019re somewhere, let\u2019s say, between $5 million and $10 million. So, you will have maybe those type increase. But then, again, when we start to think about the unfunded, will you have that same $8.3 million unfunded in Q1? Probably not. Will you have that same $5.5 million increase in stock compensation in Q1? Probably not. So, that\u2019s why you had a lot of the offsets. And again, coming back to where you reset the incentive compensation level to a 1X target versus the elevated levels that we had in 2016.", "Aaron Deer", "That\u2019s great. Thanks for the clarification. And congrats on the new gig, Mike.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "All right, thank you. Just looking at that provision for unfunded commitments, the $8.3 million, how much of the $8.3 million was a one-time readjustment versus how we should be looking at the distribution between provision and traditional line and provision and the expense line for normal growth going forward?", "Michael Descheneaux", "For all practical purposes, the majority, if not all of it, was more or less related to that. As you\u2019ve seen, kind of in a given quarter anyway, it's in plus or minus kind of $1 million. So, it\u2019s usually a pretty small number overall. So, the vast majority of that number would be just this enhancement. ", "Jared Shaw", "Okay, okay. And then, maybe just a little bigger picture \u2013 I appreciate the commentary on potential tax reform. But as you look at \u2013 if the domestic tax situation got significantly better, does that change your views in terms of opportunity for international growth? Would you expect to see more of those customers actually just coming into the US and trying to develop domestically or would there still be the same opportunity for future foreign growth?", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Jared. This is Greg. Almost back to my earlier comments, it\u2019s just too early to start speculating on what would happen because there is a lot of positive potential things that happen. There's other things that made \u2013 people have asked us about, how does it impact your clients in a negative basis, the ones that operate globally. Really, the great thing about our client base is that it is very nimble and flexible and they\u2019re used to just being able to change very quickly. And that's one of the most positive things about our client base. And so, it\u2019s just too early for us to start thinking about what I'll call strategic change or anything related to that until there is a lot more clarity.", "Jared Shaw", "Great, thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.", "Brett Rabatin", "Hey, good afternoon. Congrats, Mike.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Brett.", "Brett Rabatin", "I wanted to just go back on the tax rate. If we do have reform, just thinking about the effect it would have on your earnings, would all of that fall to the bottom line? Just thinking about the DTA adjustment you made in the fourth quarter, how should we think about the implications if the tax rate is lowered on your actual earnings?", "Michael Descheneaux", "I think the implication is we would all be ecstatic, first and foremost. Clearly, as you\u2019ve seen, generally, for our banks, we have one of the higher effective tax rates in the industry. And part is, because we operate in some of the most expensive, high tax rate states such as California and Massachusetts. But, clearly, we would stand to benefit significantly if they lower the federal rate down to 20% or 15%, whatever the number they're talking about. And for us, we tend to get a bigger lift in other banks because we have less composition of tax advantage investment security. So, said another way, we have less municipal investment securities than other banks may have. We don't have bank owned life insurance. We don\u2019t have a few of these other products or as many of the other things. So, we will definitely benefit a lot more for that. So, one can only hope that it will drop, but, as Greg said, it\u2019s just too early to tell to even start to count anything.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay. So, nothing really to offset the decrease. And then the other question I had was, the last time you\u2026", "Greg Becker", "If I just may clarify, because you were just talking about something to offset the decrease, I didn\u2019t quite understand what you meant by that.", "Brett Rabatin", "Just if there was anything you would \u2013 in terms of \u2013 if the tax rate was lowered, if there was anything that you were going to have \u2013 like, would it all drop to the bottom line essentially? And it sounds like that\u2019s the case.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Yeah, I think that\u2019s a fair way to look. At this point \u2013 again, there\u2019s been talk about what\u2019s deductible, what\u2019s not deductible. Again, we can\u2019t go into that because it\u2019s just \u2013 who knows right now. But just, all things being equal, if you drop the federal tax rate, you're right, for the most part, at this point, we would see most of it drop into the bottom line and benefiting shareholders.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay. And then, the other question I had was just around credit. The last time, you guys talked about the higher end of the range on charge-offs. I think people got a little antsy about the early stage. Can you maybe just talk about the recalibration and what may have fallen out in the fourth quarter in terms of early stage and just any thoughts around what you're seeing in terms of the early-stage portfolio?", "Marc Cadieux", "So, it\u2019s Marc Cadieux. Early stage was interesting in the fourth quarter, in that we saw charge-off levels in the early-stage segment that were reminiscent of 2015 best of times, but then we also saw an increase in new early-stage non-performers, indicative of that continued stress in that segment, going on from the recalibration that started last year. And given the diminished rate of investment in early-stage companies throughout 2016, it\u2019s our conclusion that we\u2019ll continue to see some stress in that segment. Having said that, I think as our guidance reflects, we expect that stress overall to be manageable and, by extension, to be able to live within the charge-off guidance for 2017.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay, great. Thanks for the color.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks, Brett.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Christopher McGratty", "Hey, good afternoon. Congrats, Mike.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Thank you, Chris.", "Christopher McGratty", "If we\u2019re thinking about the next rate hike, your off-balance-sheet, your client investment fee rate, I think, last time, were up about 2 basis points. Is that about the rate of assumption we should assume for each subsequent raise or is there any kind of upward or downward adjustment?", "Greg Becker", "Hi, Chris. It\u2019s Greg. That is a good job benchmark to take into consideration. You\u2019re right. It was roughly 2 basis points. And if we saw another 25 or 50 basis points, you could assume it would be in that range.", "Christopher McGratty", "Okay, great. Maybe a second question on capital. Obviously, capital levels have increased nicely over the past six to nine months. Any change in the way you\u2019re approaching capital planning for 2017, given the growth aspirations in your stock price?", "Michael Descheneaux", "So, right, now all of our capital is going to continue to support our growth both here in the US and abroad as well too. You\u2019re right, capital levels have gotten stronger. They've improved for the first time at levels where we can actually consider different options. We\u2019re not advocating anything, whether it\u2019s buybacks or dividends or further growth options, but at least now, in our planning, we can start to consider about whether or not \u2013 or evaluate the different options we may or may not have. So, yes, different discussions, more discussion starting to happen here in 2017 than in the past. But nothing on the agenda right now to do anything radically different than what we've done over the last several years.", "Christopher McGratty", "Great. And maybe if I could ask one more, Greg, the comments in your opening remarks were markedly more optimistic than you were six months ago and your comments about exit markets being pretty active and healthy for 2017 was encouraging. Tough question, but third quarter was a big exit quarter for the bank. This quarter was a little bit less. Should we interpret kind of the near-term exit potential for the [indiscernible] to kind of get back to the third quarter level or is that a bit of a stretch? Thanks.", "Greg Becker", "Chris, as we have said in the past, it\u2019s the most difficult thing to predict because the window for IPO is going to open and close very quickly. M&A activity can \u2013 all of a sudden, you see a whole slew of companies. So it depends upon the extent, the size of these exits, number one, and also it depends upon the concentration. Our point is just that the outlook that we see, in talking to our clients and talking to investment banks and talking to clients and talking to strategic partners is very positive relative to what we saw in 2016. And if you look at the number of both publicly filed IPOs and what we know about our existing clients and just discussions about the private filings, it\u2019s really healthy. And that's good. And as we have said in the past, the exit market last year was very slow. But what you have happening in that time period is these companies \u2013 a lot of them continue to perform well. They\u2019re getting stronger. They\u2019re delivering better revenue. They\u2019re delivering either bottom line profits or they\u2019re narrowing their losses. All those things are good indications for what we hope is going to be a good exit year.", "Christopher McGratty", "Very helpful. Thanks a lot.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thank you for taking the question. When you\u2019re thinking about all of the regulator reforms that could happen, raising the $50 billion threshold, Volcker being changed, which one thing could regulators do that you think would make the biggest difference for your bank?", "Greg Becker", "I\u2019ll start. Those are all tempting things to think about. And, again, it\u2019s just too early to spend a whole lot of time on it. But, if you we can look at Volcker, I don't believe \u2013 assuming that we get an extension on our time to comply with Volcker, I don't think that\u2019s going to really have a dramatic impact on our business. So, if it changed, yeah, it\u2019d be nice, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see a dramatic impact on our business, which means that really the regulatory reform and the hurdles of the requirements for SIFI are the biggest things. From my standpoint, I think about the regulations \u2013 I think just like the DFAST and everything else we went through, there's a lot of positive things, benefits we got out of it as an institution that I would argue did lower our risk, which is good. On the SIFI side, there are things that I think fall into that camp and there\u2019s things that fall into the camp that from our standpoint aren\u2019t as important to lowering the risk. And so, even if you had a designation of SIFI going up to a higher level CCAR, you are still going to have to invest in the regulatory side of the house. We\u2019re still getting big. It\u2019s just the trajectory of growth that is going to actually be lowered and that's that we\u2019re looking for. So, it\u2019s mainly in that area that we would see benefit.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And then just one quick further question. The split in the president role, I guess having one president of Silicon Valley Bank and another president of SVB Financial, what\u2019s the kind of thought process there?", "Greg Becker", "So, this role, it may seem like a new role. It\u2019s actually the role I had before I became CEO. And the one benefit of that really is really aligning all the banking activities together. Today, in addition to the banking activities, more the client-facing, market-facing role that I have in my existing role, I do have the regulatory side, I\u2019ve got the risk, I have operations working with the team. Obviously, this is all done by our team. But as I look at the next five-plus years, the next ten years, being even more tightly coordinated, so that we can make decisions faster, jump on opportunities more quickly, those things I'm really excited about. It\u2019s going to allow me to focus more. And having Mike in the banking team, which has done a phenomenal job, even be more focused and take advantage of the opportunities is, to me, what I'm most excited about. And as we\u2019ve talk about it internally, I'm only getting more excited about the opportunity and what I think it will mean in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and beyond.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Great, thank you.", "Greg Becker", "Yup.", "Operator", "That concludes the question-and-answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Greg Becker for closing comments.", "Greg Becker", "Great, thanks. So, first, I want to thank everyone for joining us today. We described a strong quarter and really good momentum going into 2017. We increased a couple of areas of our outlook. So, healthy growth in 2017.", "We also think there's potential upside. As we described, our outlook doesn't include any additional rate increases other than what we saw in December. So, if the rates rise, there should be some additional benefit there. And that\u2019s even before we get into anything talking about tax reform or regulatory reform, which, as we said, is too early, but clearly we\u2019re hopeful we'll get some benefits from that. And that will turn out too in a positive way.", "As I close every call, I just want to really thank our employees for doing such a great job of taking care of our clients and really living and breathing SVB\u2019s mission. I want to thank Mike for all the things he\u2019s done as the CFO, and I know he is not going anywhere. So, he\u2019s going to be in the CFO role until we find a replacement. But I am excited about Mike and his new role. And we work exceptionally well together and I'm looking forward to that on a go-forward basis. And I also want to thank all our clients for putting the trust in us. Every quarter that goes by, I get an opportunity to spend time with our clients in a variety of different ways and I can tell you that we have, without a doubt, the most dynamic, interesting engaging clients of any institution in the world. And that's what motivates all of us every day.", "So, looking for a great year and progress next quarter. And just hope everyone has a great day.

My name is Allie and I\u2019ll be your operator for today\u2019s call. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Meghan O\u2019Leary. Meghan you may begin.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Thank you, Allie and thanks everyone for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker; and our CFO, Dan Beck are here to talk about our second quarter 2017 financial results and will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A. Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com.", "We\u2019ll be making forward-looking statements during this call and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We expect the call, including Q&A, to last approximately an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Greg Becker", "Thanks, Meghan. And thanks everyone for joining us today.", "I\u2019ll start by commenting on the markets and our business overall. But first, I want to say that we are excited to have our new, CFO Dan Beck on board and I know you are looking forward to hearing from him. Since we are only a couple months into the transition process, Mike Descheneaux, our President, who is also with us, may chime in on certain topics during Q&A, as needed. And with that let\u2019s get started.", "We had a strong quarter with record earnings per share of $2.32 and record net income of $123.2 million, and more than 20% increase over the first quarter and more than 30% increase over the same quarter last year. These results reflect the impact of the short-term rates, and on our earning base, solid credit performance and healthy levels of activity among our clients.", "Highlights of our second quarter included, net interest income growth of 10.6%; total client funds growth of 6%; a provision for credit losses of $15.8 million; return on equity of 12.75% and return on assets of 1.04%; expense growth of 5.7%; and we also received a final five-year extension for Volcker rule compliance on our covered funds.", "Let me start with our target markets. The innovation ecosystem and venture capital as a key part of that, is doing well overall with healthy transaction levels and ample capital for good companies. VCs raised $11 billion in the second quarter versus $8 billion last quarter. That reflects strong fund raising for first time funds as well as proven fund managers. Year-to-date, it appears VCs are on pace to raise more capital in 2017 than in 2016, which was the biggest year in a decade. On top of that, venture capital firms are sitting on record levels of uninvested capital and are motivated to put that capital to work.", "Venture investing overall increased 30% quarter-over-quarter to nearly $22 billion, and also appears to be on pace to exceed 2016 levels. The underlying investment data suggests that the decline in angel one [ph] seed stage investing is due to Company\u2019s bootstrapping or stretching current capital realms. Overall, entrepreneurship and new company formation are alive and well. Our levels of new client activity support this.", "With the VC markets, our challenge is in exits. The VC-backed exits declined quarter-over-quarter due to lower levels of M&A, both in terms of overall dollars and the number of deals. IPOs were relatively bright spot in this, recovering from their 2016 lows with 19 U.S. VC-backed IPOs in the second quarter alone compared to 33 for all of 2016. 68%, 13 of those IPOs were SVB clients. Based on the numbers year-to-date, 2017 IPOs appear to be poised to surpass 2016.", "While the number of IPOs has increased, recent IPO performance has been disappointing and the momentum needed to spur more IPOs has not materialized. For now, caution for private company valuations and uncertainty about the prospects for future health care, tax, regulatory reform seem to have put public market investors in a wait and see mode, despite a growing pipeline of potential public offerings. That said, we continue to see healthy activity among our clients. We added more than 1,300 new core commercial clients in the second quarter, a higher pace than usual. We are seeing growth across all client segments in all our geographies, particularly in early stage, private equity, global and the private bank. Our net client growth rate in the second quarter was the highest it\u2019s been in six quarters.", "Deal flow has been good across most sectors with private equity again being the strongest. About a third of our loan growth related to private equity is coming from new client wins. We expect private equity to remain a strong and resilient source of growth over time, given that diversity of sub sectors represented and the ability of PE firms to thrive under varying market conditions.", "With regard to our technology and life science portfolios, early stage client wins continue to dominate our new client numbers, but activity is healthy in other areas as well. We\u2019re winning new corporate finance clients at a higher pace and we\u2019re improving our ability to engage these clients to encourage them to fully leverage SVB platform.", "Among our growth stage clients, deal flow has picked up in the first half of 2017 with our strongest ever for newly booked commitments in this segment. Despite new activity, the high pace of M&A among our growth and corporate finance clients and significant amounts of new liquidity have been continued headwinds to a faster pace of loan growth year-to-date. As a result, we\u2019re slightly decreasing our outlook for 2017 loan growth.", "Nevertheless, our healthy pace of new client wins and new bookings suggest underlying trends remain strong and we believe loan growth among our tech and life science clients will improve in the second half of the year.", "Looking at the quarter, the rest of 2017 and beyond, we\u2019re optimistic about our business momentum. We\u2019re seeing significant benefit from recent rate increases, consistent with our expectations for asset sensitivity. Client funds are growing at a tremendous pace due to our highly effective client acquisition engine which has been even more successful due to our efforts to expand our client funnel. Fee income is healthy and volumes are growing, even though we\u2019re seeing some pricing compression. Our markets are expanding as our efforts to support our clients and partners.", "Globally, we have applications underway in Canada and Germany as well as the new investments to support our positive momentum in the UK. Domestically , we\u2019ve recently expanded our offices in New York and have plans to expand in San Francisco to accommodate our growth and the opportunity in those thriving entrepreneurial markets.", "As I noted at the beginning of my comments, our expenses increased more than expected in the second quarter and we raised our outlook for expense growth as a result. Part of it is incentive compensation related to our ROE performance and our improved bottom line outlook; the rest of it is to support growth. We are a growing company. This is what it takes to support that growth and continue to build on momentum, even as we work to strike optimal balance between investing in growth and being efficient.", "We\u2019re enhancing partnerships, on-boarding processes and operational support to expand the client funnel I talked about and make sure we remain at the center of the early stage ecosystem. We\u2019re spending on new initiatives, products and enhancing the client experience including the talent required to lead and implement these initiatives.", "We\u2019re taking steps to boost our fee income growth and putting our credit card penetration making sure our global clients are taking advantage of our foreign exchange products, getting the right off -balance sheet products and ensuring we\u2019re providing clients with access to our products early in their life cycle. And we\u2019re investing in all areas of risk management to support our growth, higher requirements related to compliance and preparation for CCAR and hence prudential standards.", "Our growth requires systemic efforts to drive our operating leverage and a reduction in our expense growth rates. As a result, we\u2019re focused on a variety of opportunities to simplify and consolidate systems, reduce manual process and deploy enabling technology.", "Looking ahead, our record results and our momentum as we enter the second half of the year are solid, and we remain positive about our markets, our growth plans and our ability to execute on those. Our clients are raising capital, they\u2019re getting funding and they\u2019re performing well overall. They\u2019re doing all this despite anxiety over the situation of Washington, lower early stage investments and underperforming exit markets. Likewise, SVB is delivering strong growth. We\u2019re investing in our business and maintaining solid asset quality. We\u2019re doing this despite intense competition and M&A-driven turnover in our loan book.", "We believe our success comes from our focus on things that we excel at, which are building, maintaining lifelong relationships with companies, investors and entrepreneurs; leveraging our unique knowledge, networks and insights to help our clients succeed; and being the best partner to innovators, entrepreneurs and our investors around the world. Ultimately, we believe the growing innovation industry and the convergence of tech and non-tech is going to lead the significant new opportunities in our target markets. We\u2019ll continue to manage our business for the long-term so that we can be a critical part of it.", "And now, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our CFO, Dan Beck.", "Dan Beck", "Thank you, Greg. Good afternoon. It\u2019s great to be here and to join this exceptional team.", "We delivered a good quarter with strong increase in net income due to health revenue growth and continued stable credit performance, while expense growth remains an area of focus.", "Highlights of the quarter included, one, strong growth in net interest income, driven by higher interest rates and a larger balance sheet; two, stable credit with notable improvements in underlying trends; three, strong capital and liquidity; four, improved warrant gains related to valuation increases; five, solid core fee income growth, driven by client investment fees, albeit somewhat below our expectations; and six, higher expenses related to higher people costs including incentive compensation, infrastructure and operational costs along with risk and compliance related expenses. Overall, we continue to see healthy growth and positive momentum in our pipe line. I\u2019ll walk you through some specifics and discuss the few changes to our full year outlook.", "Let me start with the balance sheet, where we see healthy growth overall. Average loans increased by $439 million or 2.2% to $20.5 billion driven by private equity and the private bank. The pace of M&A among our clients, which included some large deals in the second quarter, the abundance of liquidity in our ecosystem, and heavy VC investment are constraining faster loan growth for now especially in the technology and life sciences portfolio. However, as Greg pointed out, new loan commitments are strong and our pipeline looks stood. So, we feel positive about our loan growth opportunities moving forward.", "Based on our balances at midyear, we\u2019re trimming our full year 2017 loan growth outlook from the high teens to the mid teens. This amounts to a reduction of approximately $500 million.", "Turning to client funds. Average total client funds grew by $5.1 billion or 6% to $91.2 billion. This increase reflected strong average deposit growth of $2.1 billion or 5.5% driven by robust new client acquisition and healthy equity funding for our clients. These trends and the significant amounts of dry powder available for investment suggest deposit growth will remain strong. As a result, we\u2019re raising our full year deposit growth guidance from the mid single digits to the high single digits.", "Average off -balance sheet client investment funds also grew strongly by $3 billion or 6.5% due to strong equity funding for investor backed clients and active secondary public offerings among our larger life science clients. Despite the slow recovery of the IPO markets, secondary public offerings remained a robust source of liquidity. Average assets increased $2.2 billion or 5% to $47.5 billion. We crossed the $50 billion asset level for two days during the quarter and expect to reach the threshold that requires SIFI compliance by early 2019, which would make us subject to public CCAR reporting in early 2020.", "Moving to capital. Capital on liquidity remains strong. Tier 1 leverage ratios at the Bank and holding company remained well within our target ranges, despite a modest decline at the Bank level driven by strong deposit growth and dividend form the bank to the holding company.", "Now, I would like to turn to the income statement. Net interest income grew strongly by $32.7 million or 10.5% to $343 million, driven mainly by the benefit of the December and March fed funds increases and increasing balances on both loans and investment securities as well as one extra day in the quarter. In total, we had increases of $17.1 million in interest on loans, $10.3 million in cash and investment securities interest income, and $5.8 million in loan fees, mostly from early repayments. Total yields increased by 30 basis points which primarily reflected the impact of short-term rate increases. As we discussed last quarter, we are seeing approximately 60% to 70% of each increase in fed funds translate to improvement in loan yields. We also saw a small increase of our deposit cost of 2 basis points in the quarter. Higher short-term interest rates drove an increase of 12 basis points in our net interest margin to 3%, consistent with our expectations.", "We are raising our full year 2017 outlook for net interest income growth from the high teens to a range of the high teens to low 20s. This accounts for the expected full impact of the March and June rate increases along with the higher investment in cash balances due to robust deposit growth. This does not include any future rate increases. Likewise, we are refining our expectations for our net interest margin towards the top half of our previous range. We now expect net interest margin to be between 3.0% and 3.1%.", "Now, I would like to turn to credit quality, which was stable with a number of notable improvements in the quarter. Our allowance for loan losses was $236.5 million at the end of the second quarter or 1.12% of total gross loans, a decrease of $6.6 million or 6 basis points compared to the first quarter, reflective of a decrease in reserves for nonperforming loans as well as improved overall credit quality in our performing loan portfolio. Our provision for credit losses was $15.8 million compared to the $30.7 million in the first quarter, this consisted of a provision for loan losses to $15.2 million. The provision for loan losses reflects $12.7 million and specific reserves for net new nonaccrual loans and $5 million for loan growth offset by a $2.5 million benefit related to the continued increase in capital call lines and lower criticized loan balances.", "Net charge-offs increased by $10.3 million to $22.5 million or 44 basis points of total average loans. This figure reflects gross charge-offs of $25.1 million including two loans to software clients totaling $13 million with the rest primarily from early stage software and life science companies. 87% of net charge-offs had prior reserves.", "Nonaccrual loans decreased by $18.6 million to $120.2 million or 57 basis points of total loans. This decrease reflects charge-offs of $22.8 million and repayments of $17.8 million. New nonperforming loans of $22 million were primarily from companies in our software portfolio and represent a substantial drop from prior quarters.", "While liquidity and valuation still pose a risk for early stage credits, we\u2019re seeing good overall performance across the portfolio and solid trends in underlying credit metrics. We\u2019re maintaining our full year credit outlook for 2017.", "Now, I\u2019d like to turn to non-interest income which is primarily composed of core fee income and net gains from warrants and private equity and venture capital related investments. GAAP non-interest income was $128.5 million, up $10.8 million or 9.2% over the first quarter. Non-GAAP, non-interest income, net of non-controlling interest, was $119 million, an increase of $7.9 million or 7.1% over the first quarter. Increase was primarily related to better warrant gains and an increase in core fee income due to higher client investment fees.", "Let me review the components. Equity warrant gains were $10.8 million in the second quarter, up $4.1 million or 61.1%. These were driven primarily by valuation increases from new funding rounds which are unrealized gains. This compares to gains of $6.7 million in the first quarter, primarily due to realized gains from M&A activities.", "Non-GAAP net gains on investment securities net of non-controlling interests were $8.2 million, a decline of $1.3 million or 13.7% from the first quarter. This reflects approximately $6.2 million of distribution from our strategic investments and $2.7 million of valuation increases associated with our managed funds of funds.", "Moving to core fee income. Overall, we\u2019re seeing growth from strong volumes with some price compression. Core fee income increased $4.7 million or 5.7% to $87.3 million, primarily driven by higher client investment fees. Client investment fees increased by $4 million or 44% to $13 million due to higher spreads and an additional $3 billion in off-balance sheet client fund balances.", "Credit card fees were roughly flat at $18.1 million. This is an area where we\u2019re seeing higher client penetration and transaction volumes offset by lower spreads due to competition. Fees from foreign exchange transactions were also flat at $26.1 million which reflects an increase of 14% in overall transaction volumes offset by lower spreads and lower global currency volatility. As a result of pricing pressure on credit card fee income and lower spreads on foreign exchange transactions, we\u2019re decreasing our full year 2017 outlook for core fee income growth from the high teens to the mid teens. In dollar terms, this amounts to a reduction of between $7 million and $10 million pretax on an annual basis in our fee income expectations.", "Turning to expenses. Non-interest expense was $251.2 million, an increase of $13.6 million or 5.7%. Taking into consideration seasonal increases of $5.9 million in the first quarter, non-interest expenses increased by $19.5 million or 8.2%. Included in these numbers are approximately $8 million of expense items that we do not expect to recur. As a result, we are increasing our full year 2017 expense growth outlook from the low double digit to the low teens. To put it into perspective, this is an increase of approximately $17 million to $20 million pretax on an annual basis, half of which is accounted for in the second quarter.", "We expect expenses in the Q3 and Q4 to be relatively consistent with Q2 levels. While approximately $8 million of our Q2 expense increase was for one-time -- or for items we do not expect to recur, we do not anticipate a corresponded reduction in future quarters due to our plans to add people and infrastructure to build our business and to support our growth. Again, this is considered in our outlook.", "The second quarter increase came from investments and growth enhancing initiatives that Greg referred to in his comments. With that in mind, the increase was primarily attributable to three factors. First was higher people related cost of $7.7 million, excluded the Q1 seasonal expenses mentioned above. This was evenly split between staffing and compensation increases to support revenue and growth enhancing initiatives along with incentive compensations related to ROE relative to peers due to improving bottom line results. Included in this figure are approximately $4 million of non-recurring items. I would like to point out that we\u2019ve reached the ceiling on our peer-related ROE incentive compensation for the year.", "The second category was infrastructure and operationally oriented investments totaling $7.8 million in business development projects, systems and technology to support our continued strong growth and related initiatives as well as other operating costs. Of this amount, approximately $3 million relates to items that are not expected to recur.", "The third category was investments of approximately $2.7 million in enhancements to our risk and compliance infrastructure, again to support our momentum as we grow into a larger, more global organization.", "Finally a note on taxes. We recognized the $7 million tax benefit related to new accounting guidance for share-based compensation that we implemented, last quarter. This tax benefit equated to approximately $0.13 per share. As a reminder, the magnitude of this tax impact of the employee share-based transactions is a function of one, the vesting date for restricted stock units; two, the amount of in the money stock options that are exercised; and three, the change in our stock price relative to the grant date values of the share-based compensation awards. I would like to point out that the tax benefits are expected to be lower in the second half of 2017.", "In closing, we are pleased with our performance this quarter. We delivered record earnings, strong balance sheet growth and solid credit quality. Capital and liquidity remain strong to support our continued growth. We are wining new clients at a rapid pace and continue to see healthy deal activity backed by a solid pipeline, despite persistent competition and elevated M&A activity among our clients. Our clients are performing well overall, and are able to access funding and liquidity as evidenced by our robust deposit franchise. We remain focused on expanding our clients\u2019 asset base, penetration, product offering and global footprint while delivering high-quality growth and stable credit quality. And lastly, we continue to invest prudently to enhance our infrastructure to support our growth and meet increasing regulatory requirements.", "Thank you. And I\u2019ll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Ken Zerbe", "I guess maybe a question for Dan, just in terms of -- if I heard your SIFI comments correctly, I think you said that you plan to cross over or sort of be eligible, if you will, in the first part of 2019. I just want to make sure I understand the process and everything correctly, because I have your $48 billion plus in total assets currently. And I certainly have you crossing over $50 billion well on the four-quarter trailing basis well before 2019. Can you just walk us through sort of what am I missing here, why don\u2019t you cross over on four-quarter average earlier than early 2019? Thanks.", "Dan Beck", "It\u2019s a great question. That calculation is based on our end of period asset figures, as we report in our regulatory filing. We don\u2019t expect to reach the four-quarter average of that end up period amount until we get to the second quarter of 2019. So, it\u2019s really reflective of that four-quarter average. And our predictions at this point that we\u2019ll be there by the second quarter of 2018.", "Greg Becker", "Yes, clarified, the 2018.", "Ken Zerbe", "Sorry, just to be super clear, four-quarter rolling look back, 12 months look back, is fourth quarter, sorry -- second quarter of 2018?", "Dan Beck", "Second quarter of 2018.", "Ken Zerbe", "Got it, okay. And then that\u2019s when you are eligible in 2019 and then you have to file CCAR in 2020?", "Dan Beck", "You are right. Yes.", "Ken Zerbe", "Okay. That makes sense. And then, second question just in terms of the expenses, I get that you did have some of the onetime items in there, but how much of your spending currently does go towards CCAR preparation versus other items? I\u2019m just wondering how much more of the CCAR prep that we need to be thinking about.", "Dan Beck", "When we look at the increase in expenses that we talked about in our outlook, included in our guidance, we don\u2019t have a significant increase in the CCAR expenses. We are spending roughly $11 million to $13 million a year on CCAR. And the thing that that is going to get us to the right level in 2017 as we look ahead to 2018, we have been increasing that amount by $3 million to $5 million a year. And we think that that will probably get us there on the CCAR related expenses.", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. The only thing I would add to that is that it\u2019s more where you can tangibly connect it to CCAR, SIFI and hence potential standards, but there are clearly other areas in the organization in areas of risk that we still have to raise our gain. Now, how much of that relates to CCAR or SIFI versus just prudent risk management and the bar being raised, it\u2019s hard to distinguish, but we have more money obviously that we are going to be putting into the infrastructure and risk management as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I just wanted to touch based on the fee revenue outlook, I guess the guidance there has bumped a little bit over the last few quarters. Just wanted to get your sort of big picture thoughts, Greg, in terms of where have you seen some of the biggest delta, operationally in the first six months relative to when we started out the year. Was it lower ForEx fees and why lower card fees and why -- any color would be extremely helpful.", "Greg Becker", "Sure. I will start and Dan or others may want to add into it. But, I\u2019d break it down into two buckets and the areas you described, it is FX and it is cards. I will start with FX. To think about FX, the volumes remain strong. And there is really kind of a couple of components to saying why wouldn\u2019t the revenue follow that. So, one is, there are some larger transactions in there and larger transactions on the spot trades, so they have lower margins, that\u2019s number one. Number two, you have lower volatility in the FX markets. And where that\u2019s impacted actually relates to forwards and options. So that\u2019s a higher margin business. And so, since the volatility is down, you tend to have the net overall lower FX revenue despite the volumes being up.", "So, we don\u2019t know obviously where volatility will play out in the second half of the year, but that was the main driver. And so, we\u2019re expecting more of a consistent growth from volumes and some margin improvement. But, we\u2019re not expecting volatility to come back. If it does come back, we\u2019ll see some upside in FX. That\u2019s one piece.", "Second piece is on the cards. Again, much like FX, we\u2019ve seen very nice volume growth. The margins impacted for a few different areas, one is mixed but I\u2019ll give you an example where margin compressions come down and it\u2019s not in our control. So, our clients, as you would expect, have a lot of credit card purchases for Google ads and Facebook ads. What happens is Google and Facebook work with MasterCard and Visa to negotiate lower interchange fees because of the volumes going through. What happens, we get impacted more than other players because more of our clients are spending on those ads. So, that actually creates some compression and interchange in margin related specifically to our clients.", "Now, we can\u2019t predict those are the areas that will occur, those are the two biggest ones and we believe that probably [ph] negotiated longer term arrangements for that. So, we think the margins will stabilize and the volumes will pick up, so we expect to see some growth in the latter half of the year which is built into our outlook. So that -- but you do see that interchange coming down, that was the main driver. So, volume is good, some impact on the margin.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "How big of a component in your growth outlook is adding new clients for both these services or is it mostly activity levels times margin and that\u2019s what the growth is?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. And there is two different pieces, right, so one was on FX. FX is -- it\u2019s mainly selling to our existing clients, including some new with the private equity et cetera, but it\u2019s mainly to existing clients and it is penetration, right. So, we still have more penetration of our existing clients where we have clients that are sending international wires, then they are sending it U.S. dollars and the transactions being traded on FX on the opposite side. We believe we can provide our clients a better service and actually at lower price in the FX if it\u2019s traded on the front end, so there is an opportunity there to continue to growth with existing clients.", "With credit cards, again it\u2019s penetration related, so we have more upside there. And then, that is an area where you do have sometimes some larger new clients where that actually does create a material bump on a company-by-company basis. But, I\u2019d say, if you broke the two apart, the majority is going to come from existing client penetration.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Understood. And just switching gears in terms of competition on lending, I got the color what you talked about in terms of what drove slower loan growth for the quarter. But, there is a fair chatter post just last quarter\u2019s earnings around pricing competition, I think loan spreads. Just wanted to get some color in terms of how competition stacks up today versus three or six months ago? And incrementally, as we think about the June rate hike and maybe another rate hike in December, is your expectation that the sensitivity of the margin to every future rate hikes should be similar to what we\u2019ve seen so far this cycle?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. I\u2019ll start, Ebrahim, and then Marc may want to add something. I\u2019ll start with the last question first, which is what do we expect in the future. I\u2019d say, generally speaking, we would expect that same margin sharing to occur, which is roughly 60% to 70% of rate increases would be brought down.", "You have a mix question though, right. So, we continue to grow lower margin loans. But, so, you have to take that into consideration, but the net number, 60% to 70% is right. Now just competition in general. It is competitive, it\u2019s a very competitive. We\u2019re seeing it from both banks and non-banks. I would say slightly more competitive than it was, but it\u2019s not a dramatic change, it\u2019s how I would describe it. Much like we\u2019ve talked about in prior quarters, there is three different ways to look at competition. You can look at pricing, you can look at size of loans and you can look at structure. We look at the deal, we look at the overall risk, and we may be willing to drop pricing a little bit depending upon how quality it is. We may be willing to do a larger loan if it has structure. Where we see again some pressure is the structure as well and that\u2019s an area we really want to be disciplined on.", "Mike has talked in the past about smart growth, we would put it in the smart growth category. That being said, the one last point I\u2019d make is, we as I described, had a very strong pipeline, we had very strong level of booked commitments and our hope is that we\u2019ll give guidance or give future loan growth in the second half of the year. So, with that I\u2019ll pause and see Marc, if you have anything to add.", "Marc Cadieux", "No, you covered it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson. Please go ahead.", "Jennifer Demba", "Ebrahim, pretty much just covered my question. But, could you just go into, as much color as you can on the reasons for the tampering the loan growth outlook for the rest of the year?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. Jennifer, I\u2019ll start. And it is mainly driven because of what we saw in the first and the second quarter, because you\u2019re talking to deal with averages. And so, if you see that being lower than what we thought, obviously that plays out for the balance of the year, number one. Number two, we do look at it and say despite what I said, we do believe the second half will be stronger than the first half, especially in the tech and second life science portfolio. We still believe, it\u2019s going to be very competitive and we still believe we\u2019re going to have to be smart about where we do want to lean in and where we want to back away. So, I wouldn\u2019t read anything into it more than that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "Just on the expense side, when you spoke about the $7.7 million incremental growth in expenses quarter-over-quarter compensation, did I hear you right that a third of that is roughly, call it revenue producing personnel, a third is support, and a third is due to the ROE adjustment, was that correct?", "Dan Beck", "It\u2019s generally correct. If we look at it we get the $7.7 million worth of increase, $4 million of that is non-recurring items, a half of that relates to the ROE plans as well as some other onetime items related to benefit cost. So, rest, the 3.7 is really people related and growth related people cost.", "Jared Shaw", "And then on the -- looking at third quarter with the expectation -- third and fourth quarter with the expectation that expenses are flat. Where else -- so that $8 million is not recurring, it\u2019s going to be distributed in other categories. Is that still going to be increased hiring or should we expect to see, is it professional services, as you are ramping up maybe new systems? Maybe just a little color on where that $8 million gets reallocated.", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg. Jared, it\u2019s going to be across the board. It is going to be in additional hiring. And again, go back to the fact that whether it is expanding into different markets, supporting our growth, so we are adding people in a variety of different areas, number one. Number two, it is about systems and infrastructure, as I talked about. We do have to make investments in that area. And it will be front-end loaded and quite honestly, we will be seeing that for a while where we have to invest in systems to improve the manual processes and procedures that we do have. And so, you will see it in a variety of areas. But, we try to give you enough color to give you a little more clarity on expectations on absolute numbers in the third and the fourth quarter which is why Dan shared the commentary about we expect third and fourth quarter to be generally in the range on an absolute basis at the level of Q2.", "Jared Shaw", "And then, on the investments in these systems, ultimately are these more people heavy or is it more software heavy where we should see as we look out maybe in 2018 more operating -- positive operating leverage coming from those investments or is it really as the business grows, the pace of growth with these new investments have to maintain or keep up with that?", "Greg Becker", "I would love to make it a simple answer and say it\u2019s just one area and it\u2019s going to be all about efficiency. But there is systems that we have that we\u2019ve had for a while that we just have quite honestly there end of life and we have to upgrade. And so, there isn\u2019t going to be a material cost savings when those get implemented. So, the others really are about looking at manual process and procedures whether it\u2019s a client on-boarding, it\u2019s such a simple one where the way we have it today, we have a really great front-end that it makes easy for our clients. But the back-end side of it is an incredibly manual intensive process. We have got to make that automated end to end to create more efficiency. So that would be an example of one that would create efficiencies and scalability but there is others that truly are end of life or it just is an area that we just actually need system capabilities that we don\u2019t have today. So, it\u2019s an incremental add.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "I want to make sure I fully understand this. So, if we look at the updated expense outlook, is the increased guidance primarily tied to higher incentive comp or since last quarter, have you also decided now to accelerate the pace of investment?", "Greg Becker", "This is Greg, Steve. So, it\u2019s a little bit of catch up in the second quarter on incentive compensation. And obviously we look it for the whole year and so that incentive compensation will be built in. And we\u2019re going to be spending more money on different infrastructure and growth initiatives. So, it\u2019s a combination of both.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, got you. Thank you. And then, on the total client funds, you guys had almost growth [ph] in total client fund this quarter that you had all last year. Could you give more color what\u2019s driving this growth? Do you see more rounds, are there larger rounds, what is it?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. It\u2019s again variety of different things, one is you saw the numbers in the quarter I talked about and it was an incredibly strong quarter for venture capital activity. We saw a number of rounds that were pretty amazing. The number of $100 million rounds that were closed, was truly astonishing and we\u2019re winning the majority of those client funds, a 100% almost, all those dollars are coming to us. We had another client that raised in the UK a massive amount of money and again we got the majority of those funds. And so, it is about large rounds.", "But the second part is about increasing our funnel and adding a lot of new clients. So, we, as I said we had 13 new core commercial clients. And so that was -- that is good. And the other part is, one of the areas we\u2019ve done an off-balance sheet is that we have gone after what I\u2019ll call prospects that they are not clients of ours but they have their larger net excess cash and targeting them to start with actually selling our off-balance sheet product for cash management and then looking at buildings bringing them in as clients. So, it\u2019s still strategy combined with just very strong market growth, market liquidity right now.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Got you. And I think you partially answered this, but if we look at 60% of the client funds moving of balance sheet, I was wondering are you guys pushing that harder, given coming up on $50 billion or are clients preferring that now that rates are higher?", "Greg Becker", "We\u2019re not changing our view. We\u2019re not pushing clients anyway. Right now, I actually feel that we\u2019ve got a really good balance to our product set. And so, they are going at the right place, they are going to place they should. And when you see these large ones, rounds get closed, those vast majority should be going off balance sheet. So, I think it\u2019s a good mix right now but short answer is we\u2019re not pushing anyone because we\u2019re getting close to $50 billion.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW. Please go ahead.", "Chris McGratty", "Maybe on the margin guide. What\u2019s the assumption that\u2019s being made that related to cash balances which obviously had tremendous growth in the quarter? What\u2019s the assumption for deployment in the back half of the year?", "Greg Becker", "Chris, this is Greg. I\u2019ll start. So, when you think about the cash balances, we\u2019re trying to keep anywhere from 1 to $1.5 billion of cash, maybe a little bit more than that. And so, you\u2019ll see spikes on a given basis, that\u2019s why you have period end balances that will be higher. But, you can look at that now. Again, the rest of it is just the model, how much money we have coming off that\u2019s actually being reinvested, and Dan may have those numbers better than I do. But, we\u2019re effectively rolling off, I want to say it\u2019s roughly $800 million quarter. And so that\u2019s getting reinvested, obviously at higher rates than they were at before, which is very helpful to the margin.", "Dan Beck", "Yes, just to add to that Greg. Our cash balance guidance is around $2 million to $3 million; that\u2019s the level that we\u2019ve been operating around. And we\u2019re replacing about $800 million -- running off about $800 million per quarter on the securities portfolio. We did add within the quarter because of the increased cash balances, close to $2 billion worth of investment securities at an overall average -- 2.4%, around that range. So, it is a pickup for us on those balances.", "Chris McGratty", "So, just so I got it, the new reinvestment rates, was 240 in the quarter, is that right?", "Dan Beck", "Yes.", "Chris McGratty", "Okay. In terms of the second half tax rate, should we -- backing out last two quarters, just kind of go back to where it was last year, maybe full year is a good proxy for the back half?", "Dan Beck", "There is a lot of volatility in that tax rate because it\u2019s driven by exercise on the stock compensation side. That being said, we expect fewer exercises in Q3 and Q4 and if that happens, and we\u2019ll be back to the 2016 rate.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "Just on the expense topic again. In terms of the higher incentive comp component, I know you indicated that in part it relates to the improving ROE. However, if you look at your ROE over the past several years, I guess going back to few years, there is not a real notable increase, and same thing with the ROA. So, I\u2019m just -- give us a little bit of color what exactly you\u2019re anchoring that to?", "Dan Beck", "So, I\u2019ll start and others might jump in. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re targeting on a portion of our incentive compensation plan, our ROE relative to peers. So, a third of our overall incentive compensation plan is driven by that pure benchmarking. You\u2019ve seen over the last few quarters and in particular this quarter an improvement in that ROE that puts us very close to the top 3 to 5 of the pure benchmark in ROE for our peer sets. So, that\u2019s truly driving component of the overall incentive compensation.", "If we take a step back on expenses, let\u2019s just look at things from a guidance perspective where we started the year. We started the year in the high single digits and now we\u2019re effectively sitting in the low teens. What that means to us just overall is anywhere between $40 million and $45 million increase in the overall expense outlook on an annualized basis. Stepping back from there, about $30 million of that relates to improved performance, which includes this component of the compensation plan tied to ROE. So, that\u2019s a big driver of the overall number. The addition to that is the investments in operations as well as regulatory and compliance area but preponderance of what\u2019s happening here relates to a performance relative -- and in particular relative to this ROE plan.", "John Pancari", "And then, on the risk and compliance investments. Can you help me out again in terms of on the risk compliance side, what investments are these that differ from what you\u2019ve already accomplished, as you approach the $50 billion. I know, you indicated, Greg, that there is more you can do on that side, beyond what you did. But can you talk about what is it that the regulators have not yet been on about improving but now it\u2019s the time to do it?", "Greg Becker", "We think about it. So, as we were growing over the last two, three, four years, we continued to invest in a variety of different areas. But, we continue to add what I\u2019ll call, expertise for people that actually have been there and done it and actually managed larger programs. And so, if you look at our risk functional overall, risk includes, it includes our compliance department; it includes our enterprise wide risk management; it includes BSA AML; it includes loan review; it includes credit review or model risk management, all those areas.", "If you look across the board and just look at what I\u2019ll call other institutions and what they are hearing and what feedbacks are getting from the regulators and just our own risk management levels, we are having to invest across all those areas, and it is both people and its technology. And for us, this really I would say is less about CCAR, although I guess part of it would be -- it\u2019s more about we just have to up our game as we get bigger as an institution, as we become more global, as we have more transaction processing all those things. So, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s one part of risk management it is actually across all areas that we need to raise our game.", "John Pancari", "If I could ask just one more, efficiency ratio expectation, could you talk about that little bit for 2018?", "Dan Beck", "So, as we\u2026", "Greg Becker", "Yes. So, I\u2019ll start. So, for 2018, usually what we end up talking about is in the October call, we start to give guidance out to 2018 and we will do that again. I just want to talk about 2018 first, Dan is going to comment on the balance of 2017.", "Dan Beck", "Yes. What I was going to say is obviously so much of that is dependent upon rate outlook expectations and there is a lot of variability that goes into that. So, it\u2019s hard to comment on exactly where things are going to end up, but with the improvement -- or the increase in June, the expectation is that it would be slightly better, but again still dependent upon what happens from rate perspective.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. Your line is open.", "Brett Rabatin", "I wanted to ask a non-expense question. I wanted to ask about credit. And if I kind of heard your tone right, it sounds like you are maybe a little more comfortable with your outlook, even though you haven\u2019t changed the specific guidance around charge-offs. I\u2019m just curious to hear how you see the environment shaping up, Greg, and then does the new guidance around pre-profit technology companies, does that going to have any effect on how you criticize the asset levels?", "Greg Becker", "I\u2019ll start at a high level and then Marc will comment on it in more detail. 2Q was a really strong quarter from a credit quality perspective. And our view is we feel good about that, we feel good about the outlook and we think a lot of what we experienced in 2016 as far as the recalibration is behind us. That being said, we\u2019ve been in this business long enough to know that one quarter is not a trend make and that you end up in a position where we feel good about where we are, but we don\u2019t feel that we have the clarity yet to kind of change our guidance. So, I\u2019ll leave it at that and turn it over to Marc.", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes. So, I\u2019ll pick up with early stage. And so, there as Greg mentioned, following the -- what we saw on the first half of 2016, we have now seen four consecutive quarters of what I would characterize as pretty typical credit quality performance in the early stage segment which is reassuring. Again, it\u2019s not necessarily predictive of the future and we do continue to hear companies that are struggling to raise that series B round of financing for example. But again, our credit quality in early stage segment continues to be stable.", "You referenced new guidance. We\u2019ve heard some questions about that I think stemming from the earnings release of another bank. We\u2019re unaware and in fact have confirmed that there is no new guidance related to lending to pre-profit companies, either inter agency or from any of the agencies independently and therefore not expecting any change in credit quality in pre-profit driven by regulatory change. Obviously, if there were to be guidance, we\u2019d have to incorporate that in our thinking and presumably if we thought it was going to have any impact, we\u2019d be talking about it.", "Operator", "And our next question comes Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "I wondered if you could help tie together a couple of things that you said earlier. In the prepared remarks at the beginning, you talked about the exit environment being tougher, less M&A taking place specifically. But then when you were talking about your client base, you mentioned M&A as being something which is being negative to loan growth. So, I am assuming that means some of your clients getting acquired. So, just curious, why you think your client base is different from the industry overall, if actually that\u2019s the case?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. So, when you think about the numbers and what people are paying attention to in the market, we\u2019re now looking at exit, they are talking about the very, very large exits, that\u2019s what the attention is paid to; that\u2019s the headline news. When we\u2019re talking about loan balances where you\u2019ve got $5 million, $10 million $15 million, you are looking at acquisitions that are actually on the lower end. And those acquisitions do then retire all the debt that we have. Typically if a company is being sold for hundreds if not billions of dollars, they probably have a lot of cash, a lot of liquidity, they probably raised a lot of money, so kind of borrowing that much at the end of the day.", "So, we just -- what we say is this is what we\u2019re experiencing. The headline news in the market is that M&A is on the softer side relative to what it was a year ago. But what we\u2019ve experienced, we look at pay downs in the second quarter. M&A clearly was a catalyst for that.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "And then, in terms of growth on the technology and life sciences, and also your healthcare loan book, just help us understand what you think that should look like over the next few years? Do we get back to the pace that we\u2019ve seen in the past or is it going to be slower from now on, just given some of the competitive factors you\u2019ve rolled out?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. When I think about -- this is Greg, and Marc will probably add some color. When I think about the tech and life science portfolio, you got couple of things going on. One is you do have with a lot of the loan products that we have, they amortize and so you start out the day with amortization in a given quarter, in a given year that you then have to replace to get back to zero. So, you get start there. The second part then is just liquidity in the market. We\u2019re at a point right now, where with the high liquidity that we have, you have lines of credit that aren\u2019t utilized or they just don\u2019t take that to the same level, because they have $50 million or $100 million or $200 million worth of cash on their balance sheet and why would they want to pay for something that\u2019s just adding more cash to that balance sheet, they may not need or probably won\u2019t need.", "That being said, when we look at the market, we view it as still a robust market, it\u2019s a growing market. Our win rate is very strong, despite it being competitive. And that\u2019s part of the reason that we\u2019re optimistic. Now what does that look like from a growth rate percentage? It\u2019s hard to predict. My take, if you look out in the future, you\u2019re going to be looking at in the single digits, mid to high single digit is where I would end up with the volatility on a given quarter and even on a given year depending upon where venture capital flow is and what the level of M&A in our client base is.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Aaron Deer from Sandler O\u2019Neill & Partners. Please go ahead.", "Aaron Deer", "One of the highlights for quarter was the client investment fees. No doubt it\u2019s coming from the large input that you have there. But I would imagine, you also got a benefit from higher rates in the fees being affected by that. Can you give us a sense of where those fees stood, maybe on a basis-point level at June 30th relative to March 31st and what kind of uptick we might get from the rate hikes that were inter quarter?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. We\u2019re roughly -- Aaron, this is Greg, roughly around 10 basis points of yield on the overall off-balance sheet management. And as you know, we were as low as 12 months ago at roughly 5 basis points. So, the rate increases that we\u2019ve seen have allowed us to go to that 10 basis points. And I think just a good rule of thumb -- obviously we don\u2019t have this factored into our outlook. But a good rule of thumb would be, right now, given the level that we\u2019re at, it\u2019s probably about a basis point per 25 basis points of increases that you would see out into the future. We talked before about maybe being as much as 1 to 2 basis points, but since we\u2019ve already gone up to 10, obviously it will start to slow down that growth with future rate increases. So, rule of thumb, 1 basis point for 25 basis points of future increases.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. And then, just a quick one on the tax rate and the impact of the share comp. Looking out to 2018, do you expect, based on the timing of the issuances that it\u2019s going to be another kind of front-loaded here in terms of the tax benefit? And then, that would fade or is it more tied to the price of the stack? It seems like -- issuances seem to be the bigger driver, but you can correct me, if I\u2019m wrong.", "Dan Beck", "Yes. Issuances as well as where the overall stock price is, are the big drivers. So, we can\u2019t say with certainty what\u2019s going to happen next year. But, when we look at where our options and where restricted stock vest is more heavily weighted to the front part of the year. So, obviously it depends on the overall stock price. But assuming it would increase, it would be more heavily weighted to the front part of the year.", "Operator", "Next question comes from Chris York from JMP Securities.", "Chris York", "So, Greg, you said in your prepared remarks that loan growth was positively affected in the private equity business. Now, I think that loan type is clumped in with VC in the Q, so could you tell us what the growth was in dollars quarter-over-quarter and then maybe what the period end portfolio size is?", "Greg Becker", "So, I\u2019m going to let Marc to give you a little more color on the Q. The one thing I would say, when we took the PES, our private equity services, it is call loans for both private equity and venture capital, and the vast majority of any growth that we see is coming from private equity not from venture capital. But Marc anymore color you want to add to it?", "Marc Cadieux", "Yes. So, loans went up in that broader type of private equity services, roughly $500 million quarter-over-quarter. This quarter was actually type of what Greg said, because that is generally a bit anomalous this quarter and that we actually had more growth from VC segment than we did from the PE segment.", "Chris York", "And maybe as a follow-up. So, can you remind us of the go-to-market strategy, maybe with sponsors as they are raising a lot new money here? And then, potentially the weighted average yield on your private equity service facilities?", "Dan Beck", "So, in terms of yields and from interest-only standpoint, the venture capital segment of private equity services is around 4% for interest only yield. Private equity is a bit less than that in the mid 3s.", "Chris York", "And then, maybe just a little color on the strategy and how sponsors are reacting to the new product -- I mean not new but relatively new for you guys?", "Dan Beck", "I think you might be confusing between sponsored buyouts perhaps and maybe their private equity capital call lines of credit.", "Greg Becker", "So, Chris, the private equity capital calls loans we\u2019ve been doing for ever and now with sponsor led buy-outs, even that has been around for -- now you are looking at almost 11 years. I would say that neither one would that in the category on new. But if you -- I\u2019ll focus on assuming you are talking about sponsor-led buyouts. So, there have been a lot of new funds raised, which is why part of our private equity services business is doing so well. We are very targeted, we are looking at -- and our sponsor-led buyout technology, mostly software buyout as well as some healthcare services deals. So, we take the large private equity market and our market, target market gets much more narrow.", "Our go-to-market is defined the right sponsors, the ones that we have worked with or the ones that have built up a good track record that we want to partner with. And we are looking at putting in the senior credit facilities for them. The strategy hasn\u2019t changed a whole lot. I would tell you that it is definitely one area that\u2019s gotten more competitive less so from banks, more from non-banks who have raised a lot of debt funds going to go larger on the structure and size side of the equation.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Matt Keating from Barclays. Please go ahead.", "Matt Keating", "Yes, thank you. Just one quick question on the international operations. I am just curious if you are seeing the same levels of more muted growth in the traditional software, hardware, life sciences practices internationally that you might be overall, are you seeing faster growth there than the U.S. at this point in those categories?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, this is Greg. We\u2019re seeing a little bit faster growth. It\u2019s still competitive less so from banks, more so from the non-banks that are out there. But because you don\u2019t have -- I mean you\u2019re adding newer clients at a faster pace as a percentage of the portfolio, you don\u2019t have the same level of turnover. And therefore, those balances can build more quickly than what you see in the U.S. So, we\u2019re seeing nice growth in the global markets, I mean UK specifically for tech and life sciences. But it is definitely competitive.", "Matt Keating", "Right. And now, Germany and Canada expansion, are those still in the works right now and expect to bring those on line over the next couple of years, is that a fair timeline?", "Greg Becker", "Yes. Obviously, I\u2019ll start with subject to regulatory approval. We would expect that in the hopefully in the first half of 2018, we\u2019ll be able to start getting some traction in those markets. But again, just to take a step back, either of those markets are going to go from very little base that you\u2019re starting from or no base in one case, and you\u2019re going to be building on that. So, it will take a while. How I describe it is, you\u2019ve got the core loan growth from the areas that we describe and Germany or Canada is going to be icing on the cake.", "Operator", "And the next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.", "John Pancari", "Hi. Sorry to queue back in, I\u2019d one more quick follow-up. You mentioned, the ROE rationale on your comp and versus peers. Who is your peer group that you\u2019re talking about?", "Greg Becker", "Yes, I think it\u2019s in our proxy and it\u2019s pretty clearly outlined. So, I don\u2019t know all the names off the top of my head and I don\u2019t want to spend time on the call going through it, but you can look it up on the proxy.", "John Pancari", "That\u2019s what I just wanted to confirm, it\u2019s within the proxy. Okay. All right, thanks.", "Operator", "And that concludes our question-answer-session. I will turn the call now back over to Greg Becker for final remarks.", "Greg Becker", "Great, thanks. So, in closing, I just want to say thanks to everyone for joining us today. When we look at the overall markets that we serve, second quarter was a really, really strong quarter in fund raising, venture funds, in investing, deployment of capital; soft on the exit side but again, what we see in our portfolio, there is companies that are performing really well. So, we feel good about again our target market. We had a record quarter. We\u2019re seeing the benefit after many, many years of rising rates coupled with strong fundamentals and feel good that we\u2019ve got a solid outlook for the balance of 2017. So, feel really good about where we are.", "Really as we always do, just want to thank our clients for their trust and support in us. We know we have a lot to live up to and totally appreciate their business. And thank all our employees for what they do. And just have a real strong team here, love working with and feel really good about what we\u2019ve built. And then finally, I want to thank Dan Beck for joining the team. He did a great job on his first inaugural earnings call and great addition to the team. So, thank you all and have a great day.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Nicole, and I will be your Operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note that this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to Head of Investor Relations, Meghan O'Leary. Ms. O'Leary, you may begin.", "Meghan O\u2019Leary", "Thank you, Nicole, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Dan Beck, are here to talk about our third quarter 2017 financial results and will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com. We'll be making some forward-looking statements during this call, and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in the call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We expect the call, including Q&A, to last approximately an hour. And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Gregory Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. We had an outstanding quarter, with record earnings per share of $2.79 and record net income of $148.6 million. This represents a 20% increase over the second quarter and a more than 30% increase over the same quarter last year. Our results reflect strong balance sheet growth, the continued impact of higher short-term rates on our earning assets, solid credit performance, good core fee income growth and healthy levels of activity among our clients.", "Highlights of our third quarter included net interest income growth of 9.2%, loan growth of 5.2%, total client funds growth of 6.7%, bringing us close to $100 billion of total client funds, core fee income growth of 17.7%, warrant gains of $25 million, primarily driven by Roku's successful IPO, and a return on equity of 14.6% and a return on assets of 118 basis points.", "Our clients continue to perform well overall despite mixed performance data from Venture Capital Markets. 2017 VC investment is still on track to be the highest in a decade, although both dollars and deals declined in the third quarter. Mega rounds in later stage start-ups continue to outpace investment in smaller, earlier stage companies.", "The IPO market remains soft as many later stage companies are staying private longer and taking advantage of readily available liquidity. With only 8 US VC-backed IPOs in the third quarter following two quarters of improvements, expectations for a robust VC-backed IPO recovery in 2017 have faded. However, we're on a somewhat better run rate than in 2016 and post-IPO performance is improving. Of the 5 largest US VC-backed IPOs during the quarter, all are trading above their initial IPO prices.", "New company formation remains healthy and there is ample capital available for good companies. VCs are sitting on some $93 billion of uninvested capital. And although investments in early stage companies declined, 1/3 of the $21 billion invested during the quarter went to early stage and seed-stage companies. Our client acquisition remained healthy as we added nearly 1,300 new core commercial clients for the second consecutive quarter.", "Overall, we are pleased with the continued momentum in our business. Our balance sheet is growing strongly due to healthy client acquisition as well as good business conditions overall and ready access to liquidity for our clients. We continue to benefit from recent rate increases consistent with our expectations for asset sensitivity.", "Fee income continues to grow driven by healthy transaction volume, in particular in FX and credit cards. And asset quality remains solid, a testament to our ongoing discipline and commitment to high quality growth despite the competitive environment. In many cases, the results we're seeing today are directly tied to investments we've been making in our growth which I spoke about last quarter. For example, we began investing to grow our market share of private equity firms 4 years ago. As part of this, we adopted a national team approach to allow us to better coordinate among ourselves and provide a higher level of service to our clients, and added valuable expertise in the form of new hires. Since that time, we have significantly increased our private equity client count and, as you know, private equity has become the primary driver of our loan growth, a major contributor to total client funds, and a significant driver of fee income. We're also applying these lessons learned through our experience to our technology and life sciences practices to help drive growth there.", "Our private bank is another area where we have made investments in the past 3 years that have nearly doubled our client count and more than doubled loan balances while also helping us cement key relationships through a high level of service. Notwithstanding this success, we believe we are only scratching the surface on the growth potential in private bank and we will continue to invest in its growth.", "Likewise, in foreign exchange we have seen positive outcomes from our investments in people, expertise and focused client engagement. Our foreign exchange team just had its strongest quarter ever with just under $30 million in revenue.", "Thanks to these outcomes and our solid performance overall, we expect to end 2017 on strong footing and the markets and our momentum suggest 2018 will be a strong year as well. As we move into 2018 and think about building and maintaining our unique position as the bank for the global innovation economy, we have numerous initiatives that we believe will help ensure our long-term growth. I would like to highlight 4 of them.", "First is raising the bar on client engagement and connecting with clients in a more meaningful way. Overall, we've done a really good job with client engagements, but we believe there is significant opportunity to strengthen and support our growth by making targeted improvements. For example, our early stage clients typically place a high priority on speed and efficiency of getting their accounts set up. We are looking at creating a frictionless onboarding experience through digitized client acquisition capabilities.", "On the other side of the client experience, we want to enhance our relationships with our private bank and wealth management clients. Our clients trust us and want to work with us more closely so we are adding expertise and looking at expanding our capabilities and offering unique or tailored alternative assets that reflect the access we have as a result of our position in the innovation economy.", "An important aspect of enhancing client engagement will also be allowing our employees to scale by making it easier for them to do their jobs by giving them access to information and analytics that will enable them to offer unique insights to clients and reducing and eliminating time consuming manual processes so they can spend more time supporting our clients.", "A second initiative will be continued investments in our global expansion. We are putting more resources behind our successful and growing UK Office which year-over-year has achieved 29% average loan growth, 62% average client funds growth, and just recently had its best quarter ever in foreign exchange. And we believe we have a lot more growth ahead.", "Obviously our Canadian and German applications will remain priorities and we hope to be up and running in both countries by mid-2018, regulatory approvals pending. We will also continue to support clients in Asia through our joint venture in China and SVB's direct efforts. Our business in Asia continues to expand in one of the fastest growing markets in the world.", "A third area of focus will be growing our fee income. We want to build on our long-term focus of starting with clients early in their lives to take a holistic approach, to improving product penetration across our clients, adding specialty teams to work on identifying and meeting the needs of specific client segments, and continuing to partner with and capitalize on the capabilities of our innovative FinTech clients.", "Finally, we'll take a more holistic approach to enhancing our risk management across the organization. This includes continuing our investment in enterprise wide risk management to meet the higher standards related to CCAR and Enhanced Prudential Standards, enhancing credit risk management so we continue our strong record of excellent credit quality, and investing in all regulatory areas of risk management including compliance in BSA and AML.", "Our focus on these areas combined with the execution of our long term strategic plan will enable us to drive deeper relationships with our clients, develop deeper engagement with our employees, and deliver strong financial results in both the short and long term.", "As we have done in prior years, I'd like to share our preliminary outlook for the upcoming year. For 2018 we expect average loan growth in the mid-teens. Average deposit growth in the low double digits; Net interest income growth from the high teens to the low 20s (This assumes a flat rate environment. If rates rise consistent with the forward curve, we would expect net interest income growth in the low to mid 20s.); Core fee income growth in the mid to high teens; Net charge offs consistent with 2017 of between 30 and 50 basis points; and noninterest expense growth in the high single digits.", "I'd like to stress this is a preliminary outlook, assumes the macro environment holds, and is subject to change. Based on what we know today, we expect a good 2018. In summary, I am incredibly proud of our Q3 quarterly results, strong engagement with our clients, and I am very optimistic about our outlook both in the short and long term. We are the centre of the innovation economy, one of the most robust in the world, have the most innovative and resilient client bases you could ask for, and incredibly talented employees.", "Finally, I want to say a word about the natural disasters that have devastated parts of the country recently: the hurricanes that hit Texas and Florida in August, September, and the wild fires that raged through northern California earlier this month. These tragedies affected many of our colleagues, clients, families and friends and our thoughts and prayers are with all of them.", "For those of you who would like to help aid the recovery, many excellent local and national organizations are accepting donations to support the coordinated relief, recovery and rebuilding efforts in these affected areas. I know they need all the help they can get, so we ask everyone to do what they can to support these efforts.", "Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to our CFO, Dan Beck.", "Daniel Beck", "Good afternoon, everyone. As Greg outlined, we delivered an outstanding quarter with a strong increase in net income due to continued balance sheet growth, expansion in core fee income, stable credit performance and healthy warrant gains.", "Highlights of the quarter included the following. One, strong growth in net interest income due to robust balance sheet growth both from loans and deposits and the impact of recent rate increases. Two, good core fee income growth driven primarily by foreign exchange, client investment fees, lending related fees and credit cards. Three, notable warrant gains primarily from valuation gains related to Roku's successful IPO. Four, stable credit with solid, underlying trends. Fifth, somewhat higher expenses related to incentives reflecting our strong performance as well as some non-recurring items. And six, continued strong levels of capital and liquidity.", "We continue to see healthy growth across the business and solid momentum that we expect to continue through 2017 and into 2018 assuming the macro environment does not change.", "Now let me turn to the details. Starting with the balance sheet, where we saw very healthy growth, average loans increased by $1.1 billion or 5.2% to $21.6 billion, driven primarily by private equity capital call lines with strength in mortgage loans and technology lending. The pace of new lending remains solid across our businesses and we saw improved period end growth in our technology portfolio in the third quarter.", "New loan commitments are strong and our pipeline remains healthy. That said, the abundance of liquidity in the ecosystem continues to weigh on technology and life sciences loan growth for now. For the full year 2017, we expect to come in near the middle of our mid-teens outlook, assuming that clients' M&A activities remain near Q3 levels.", "Turning to client funds, average total client funds grew by $6.1 billion, or 6.7% to $97.3 billion. This increase reflected strong average deposit growth of $1.9 billion or 4.5% to $44 billion, driven by the continued trends of robust new client acquisition and healthy equity funding for our clients. These trends and the significant amounts of dry powder available for investment suggest deposit growth will remain on its strong trajectory.", "For the full year 2017 we expect deposit growth to come in at the high end of our outlook range of the high single digits, assuming current deposit growth trends continue. Average off-balance sheet client investment funds also grew an exceptional $4.2 billion, or 8.5%, also driven by strong equity funding for investor-backed clients helped by active secondary public offerings among our larger clients. Average assets increased $2.2 billion or 4.7% to $49.7 billion. Period end assets ended the quarter at $50.8 billion and we expect to reach the four-quarter average of $50 billion by the second or third quarter of 2018. Meaning we'd be subject to the Enhanced Prudential Standards compliance for $50 billion bank holding companies by mid-2019, and CCAR reporting in early 2020.", "Now I'd like to turn to the income statement. Net interest income grew strongly by $31.3 million or 9.1% to $374 million, due to higher loan balances, higher investment balances which grew $1.6 billion or 7.5% due to deposit growth, the impact of the June Fed Fund's increase, and one extra day in the quarter. This increase in net interest income was consistent with our expectations.", "Loan interest income increased $18.2 million or 7.3% and income from investments increased by $14.2 million or 14.7%. Average gross loan yields, excluding interest recoveries and loan fees, increased by 10 basis points, primarily due to the June rate increase. Approximately 55% to 65% of each rate increase translated to improvements in loan yields with the remainder absorbed by spread compression primarily on our private equity business.", "Overall loan yields increased 4 basis points due to lower fees in the third quarter and as a result of the impact of interest recoveries on nonperforming loans in the second quarter. Deposit betas remain low with less than a 10% change in deposit costs on a year-over-year basis. Our net interest margin increased by 10 basis points to 3.1% due to higher loan yields and higher investment yields as we purchased $2.8 billion of new investments in the third quarter at yields of 2.5%, replacing securities at 1.6%. Six maturities in the portfolio are roughly $700 million per quarter, not including prepayments.", "We are maintaining our full year 2017 outlook for net interest income growth. However, we are narrowing it to the top end of our percentage range. We expect full year net interest income growth at the low end of the low 20% range.", "Now I will move to credit quality, which remained stable in the third quarter. Our allowance for loan losses was $249 million at the end of the third quarter, an increase of $12.5 million over the prior quarter primarily due to increased reserves for loan growth but consistent at 112 basis points of total gross loans.", "Our provision for credit losses was $23.5 million, compared to $15.8 million in the second quarter. This consisted mostly of $13.8 million in net new specific reserves for nonaccrual loans, and $10.9 million for loan growth offset by $2.3 million related to overall improved credit quality in our performing loan portfolio.", "Net charge-offs decreased by $12 million to $10.5 million, or 19 basis points of total average loans. Non-accrual loans increased by $4.5 million to $124.7 million, or 56 basis points total loans. This increase reflects gross charge-offs of $11 million, repayments of $14.7 million, and new nonperforming loans of $30.2 million primarily from our technology portfolio. We are seeing good overall performance across the portfolio and solid trends in underlying credit metrics, although high valuation and soft exit markets still pose a risk for early stage credits.", "As all of you know, the natural disasters of the last few months have created some significant challenges for communities in coastal Texas, Florida and Northern California. As Greg mentioned, we are working to support our employees, clients and the communities that were affected. In terms of business exposure, the recent wild fires in Northern California are of most importance to us. We have been in touch with all of our clients in the affected areas and the initial news is positive. Only a handful of wineries sustained material property damage and we are not aware of any client whose availability to make and sell wine has been materially affected. We have minimal private bank exposure in the affected areas and at this point we anticipate no material impact on credit quality the near term. But a more prevalent issue is the anticipated drop in tourism during what is normally a busy season for the region which could affect their businesses in the coming months. We will continue to monitor the situation and provide updates as necessary.", "Taking all of this into consideration, we are maintaining our full year credit quality outlook for 2017. Our allowance outlook remains unchanged and we expect to come in near the low end of our net loan charge off range of 30 to 50 basis points.", "Now I'd like to turn to non-interest income, which is primarily composed of core fee income and gains from warrants and private equity and venture capital related investments. GAAP non-interest income was $158.8 million, an increase of $30.3 million or 23.5% over the prior quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interest was $153.2 million, an increase of $34.2 million or 28.7% over the prior quarter. The increase was primarily driven by warrant gains and increases across most core fee income categories.", "Equity warrant gains were $24.9 million compared to $10.8 million in the second quarter. These included $18.2 million from valuation gains related to IPO activity -- the majority of that from Roku -- and $7.4 million from warrant exercises due to M&A activity.", "I would like to point out that there is typically a 180-day lockup period associated with our IPO related securities, so the value of those holdings may fluctuate depending upon the price of the stock. Net gains on investment securities net of non-controlling interest were $9.7 million compared to $8.2 million in the prior quarter. These gains were spread relatively evenly across our strategic investments, funds of funds, and debt funds. Approximately 2/3 were unrealized valuation improvements.", "Core fee income increased by $15.5 million or 17.7% to $102.7 million driven by growth in foreign exchange, credit cards, client investment fees, and lending related fees. Fees from foreign exchange transactions rose by $3.6 million or 13.8% to $29.7 million due to higher volumes. Credit card fee revenue increased by $2.2 million or 12% to $20.3 million due to higher interchange fee income, again, from higher volumes. Client investment fees increased by $2.6 million or 19.9% to $15.6 million as a result of higher client investment fund balances and the impact of higher spreads.", "Finally, lending related fees increased by $6.9 million or 81% to $15.4 million. $4.5 million of that was the result of an adjustment for unfunded commitment fees and $1.3 million was driven by higher syndication fees. We are raising our core fee income growth outlook for the full year 2017 from the mid-teens to the high teens and we expect to come in at the low end of that high teens range.", "Turning to expenses, non-interest expense was $257.8 million, an increase of $6.6 million or 2.6%. This increase was partly related to our continued strong performance in the third quarter and included $4.3 million of higher compensation, primarily performance related. Also included in the overall increase was $3.8 million related to the write-off of an internally developed software system. Minus these expenses, we would be within the range of our current expense outlook. Nevertheless, as a result of the higher than expected expense in the third quarter, we are revising our expense outlook for 2017 from the low teens to the mid-teens. We expect our efficiency ratio will trend down over time and we are committed to making that happen. We are focused on driving better scalability and efficiency in our back office and are looking at certain investments that could help improve our operating leverage in the coming years.", "Turning to taxes, our effective tax rate increased to 39.6% in the third quarter compared to 36.8% in the second quarter. The dollar increases of $25.7 million was primarily due to higher income before taxes, while the change in effective tax rate was due to a $5.7 million decrease in tax benefits related to share based compensation which lowered our effective tax rate notably in the first and second quarters.", "Looking to 2018 and 2019, we are looking at opportunities to optimize our tax rate as we continue to monitor the debate on tax reform in Washington. We expect this strategy to include, among other things, purchases of municipal bonds and other tax advantaged investments.", "Moving to capital, capital and liquidity remain very healthy although growth in risk-weighted assets due to positive loan and investment growth trends pressured risk based capital ratios slightly. The Tier 1 leverage ratio at the bank declined 7 basis points to 7.59% and was also affected by the dividend from the bank to the holding company, but remains well within our target range.", "To wrap up, we are very pleased with our outstanding performance this quarter. We delivered another quarter of record earnings, strong balance sheet growth, and solid credit quality. Our capital and liquidity remain strong to support our continued growth. Despite persistent competition and continued M&A activity among our clients, we see a healthy stream of new clients and continued momentum in our pipeline. We are benefiting from the recent rate increases and, should there be any future increases, we would expect to see upside to our current outlook. Loan growth, client fund growth and fee income are all strong and reflect the general good health of our clients as well as their access to funding and liquidity.", "Our positive revisions to our full year outlook more than offset the expense increase and we are well positioned for strong growth in 2018. We remain focused on expanding our business and our product offerings while improving our penetration among clients, delivering high quality growth and maintaining strong credit quality. And we continue to make the necessary investments in infrastructure, people, that will enable us to maintain our momentum while meeting the increasing regulatory requirements of being a $50 billion bank.", "Thank you, and now I'll ask the Operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Zerbe from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "I wanted to just ask the first question about expenses. I want to put you on the spot a little bit here. So, if we go back a year ago, your expense guidance for the year was high single digits. You came in, you're on track at least for call it mid-teens expense growth, while at the same time, your loan growth is a little bit lower than what you expected. Now fast forward to today, you're still calling for mid or high single digit expense growth in 2018. But what does that depend on? Because how do we get comfortable that you're going to stay in the high single digits versus see that creep up to the mid-teens again this year or next year?", "Daniel Beck", "This is Dan. I'll answer and others might want to jump on. So again, as we look at 2018 in particular, and historically around our overall expenses, there are really two key drivers. One is paying for performance and the second is investing to support our growth. We've continued to see quite strong growth across all categories including loans as well as fee income. And at the same time, have continued to see a strong improvement in ROE, especially relative to our peers. So, the performance aspects are there, and as we talked about, as we start to think about 2018, the expectation is there for again strong performance in the year. At the same time, we know that we need to make some investments to support our growth on a long-term basis and that expense that we have incurred this year will helps in next year as well to support the overall expense levels.", "Gregory Becker", "Ken, this is Greg. The only thing I would add to what Dan said is, when you look at the performance that we've had, and again, admittedly part of this is being helped by interest rates, we look at that performance and I would say there's probably some opportunistic things that we've done as we think about 2018 to say, look, given the performance, given the loan growth, given the deposit growth, total client funds and where we believe it's going to go, it's a good time to be putting some more money back into infrastructure to help, again, not just fuel the growth in 2018, but look at 2019 and 2020 and beyond. So, part of that does go into the fact that we're looking longer term for investments as well.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "I guess first, I just want to touch upon, just to follow-up on Ken's question on expenses, I believe, Greg, you mentioned last quarter that based off of the ROE component of the incentive comp, that number should be about $30 million in 2017. Is it safe to assume that that $30 million is going to remain unchanged next year? Or is there some upside to that based on additional ROE improvement that you might see in 2018?", "Gregory Becker", "Ebrahim, it's Greg. I'll start and Dan may want to add. So, there's two components as you comment. One is, there is 1/3 of our incentive compensation tied to ROE and it is relative, and the other 2/3 relates to our forecast, our internal budgeting purposes. And as you said, this year we kind of maxed out at as high as it can go. And again, assuming our outlook plays out, we would envision that would be at the high end of that range next year. So, the number, the percentage won't change very much. The only delta will be that as we add more people, you're going to see that $30 million grow a little bit more. But that's not going to be a meaningful delta. The other 2/3 will be based on performance and so there is a slight recalibration, but not as much, it's not like setting it back to a 1x the way we had in prior years because we're performing so well on a relative ROE basis.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Understood. And I assume that's baked into your high single digit expense growth guidance given sort of you have a pretty positive growth outlook for next year, so that $30 million is already in the base and baked into how you're thinking about 2018 expenses right now?", "Gregory Becker", "Correct. And so therefore, the areas that you could see, again, performance improvements, is on the 2/3 depending upon how we perform against our budget and our outlook.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Understood. Switching to fees for a second, a very strong quarter. I think your guidance is very, very strong. It still feels like we had a relatively soft first half and you've seen some strength in 3Q. Is this all driven by stronger activity or has there been any changes you made at your end that has driven the sort of momentum you've see in 3Q?", "Gregory Becker", "This is Greg again. There's a few things. The first half was a little bit softer. But we also had not just the volumes were a little bit softer, but we also had some compression in margins. We talked about it with credit card fees, we talked about it with FX in Q2 and actually even a little bit in, yeah Q2. So that created softness. So, what we had is increased volumes in the third quarter and we expect obviously that those will hold into the fourth quarter. So that's one part on volumes. The second part is that we saw stability in the margins on both FX and the credit cards. So that was the major lift was the stability in the margins combined with the volumes and that's kind of what we expect to happen for the balance of the year and into 2018.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Alexopoulos from J.P. Morgan. Your line is open. ", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Greg, I appreciated the adjusted net interest income outlook you gave for 2018 if we get the forward curve right which is different than the guidance. If the forward curve played out, how would that impact your expense outlook for 2018?", "Gregory Becker", "That's a good question. One thing about the expenses, specifically on comp, it would have very little impact on that or no impact because we don't build rate increases into our incentive comp program. We neutralize that. We did that this year and we'll do that again next year. So actually, I don't think it's really going to have any impact at all.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Wouldn't it impact the ROE component of the incentive dollars?", "Gregory Becker", "We're already at the high end of that range, and so we're maxed out. So that actually wouldn't be able to go any higher.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "At some point should we expect a more meaningful ramp in expenses though as you guys get ready to cross the SIFI threshold which Dan said would be mid-2019?", "Gregory Becker", "Yeah, I'll start and my answer is no. Here's the one thing that you could see, and Dan and I have talked a lot about this, which is we believe, and I said in my comments, that there are opportunities to make improvements in our manual processes and procedures and I would say make some investments there, and what would be some meaningful investments, to help with the long-term trajectory of expense growth and improve the efficiency ratio. We may come back and say here's what it looks like, here's the program and this is why we would put that into place. We don't have that outlined right now. But right now, everything we've talked about is baked into the high single digits forecast.", "Daniel Beck", "And specific to CCAR, we've talked about this in the past, we have in the number something close to $13 million to $15 million. Expect a small increase as we get into 2018. We've been investing in this over time so the cumulative investment I think puts us in a good place to be ready to cross over that threshold. So, I don't think you're going to see a major spike in those costs. We continue to monitor it and to the extent that it's necessary we'll come back, but at this point don't think it's necessary.", "Gregory Becker", "The risk I would say gets less and less over time because we're getting more information, we're getting our arms around it more. And so, I think it's a more confident comment that we don't expect to see a spike.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "I want to shift to the average client funds. You guys had a record quarter last quarter, it's even better this quarter. Greg, from a high level, I know you talked about the IPO market not being great, what is driving this? And is it sustainable here?", "Gregory Becker", "There's two aspects of the growth in client funds. One is just the overall market liquidity and although there hasn't been as much, as we talked about, in the IPO market, but the private funding market is incredibly robust. And it's impacted by the Sovereign Wealth Funds coming in, it's impacted by the Vision Fund from SoftBank, it's impacted by a lot of money that's being invested by the Venture Capital community. And even through it was only, it was down slightly from Q2, it was still $21 billion, so it was still a very significant number. So, one is just the overall volumes that are coming in. The second component of it is our teams and how well they're doing. One is just bringing in new clients on a day to day basis, so new client acquisition. Again, I said that was strong. The other part that we started in a few quarters back is actually calling on larger companies and with our asset manager group going after some bigger pools of money from larger companies. So, it's not just one thing. It's the robust market, it's the opening the funnel at the beginning and adding a lot of new clients, and it's going after later stage clients. It's combination of those things. Now is it sustainable? Clearly as we said in our outlook for at least deposits, we expect still nice growth to occur next year which we assume the market is going to continue to hold. Obviously if we see a big decline in the client and venture capital, that could change. But we feel we have a really good handle on where we are and where we're going with the team we have, the client acquisition approach and the market being stable where it's at.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jared Shaw from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. ", "Jared Shaw", "Looking at the strong growth this quarter I was surprised to see you pushed out the 4Q average to cross the $50 billion a quarter, or pushing out to the third quarter. Should we expect to see some incremental loan growth funded with securities or asset substitution on the balance sheet just given from the tone it sounds like still a robust loan pipeline?", "Daniel Beck", "Not at this point. Though we continue to see strong growth in overall deposits, we're just taking a look at where we are from an overall ending balance perspective. Still expect to see strong growth and just by the calculation of the averages, don't think that it's possible for us to cross over that threshold in the first quarter. It would have taken much more or higher growth in the fourth quarter based on where we ended the third to get us there. So, we're starting to see again continued strong growth, but the expectation just based on the way the averages play out, is that will be in the second or the third quarter.", "Jared Shaw", "How should we be thinking about growth in the noninterest bearing deposits as rates continue to grow? It's amazing that your overall costs of deposits were really unchanged. I mean could there really be a scenario where that could continue to be driven higher? Does it really matter at this point what other banks are paying given your relationship nature?", "Gregory Becker", "This is Greg. There's a couple of different things to remember. First of all, I think when people look at our balance sheet and you look at the high level of noninterest bearing deposits, it feels like it is a very low cost to funds. But you really have to bring in the off-balance sheet to look at it holistically because you're looking at more than $50 billion of client funds that are over there and that's getting a market rate of return. So, you look at that combined with some money markets accounts on the balance sheet, and then you look at the total noninterest bearing deposits, and that total mix, it may shift a little bit, in fact it probably will shift a little bit as rates pick up. But we're still able to provide market rates for our clients in our off-balance sheet options. Do we expect it to change as rates pick up? Yeah, it's going to change a little bit. But we still expect the deposit beta to be pretty low. Right now, we're basically not seeing a whole lot of change and maybe it goes up to 20 or 30, but we don't expect it to be more than that. And that's under I'd say a scenario that is rates continue to pick up from where they are right now.", "Daniel Beck", "Just to add to that, as we look ahead with additional rate increases, every 25 basis points giving us $53 million, we are modelling a slightly higher deposit beta in let's call it the 20% to 30% range versus where we are today in 10%. So, we are taking a little bit of that into consideration, we continue to monitor it, but at this point we're still less than 10% on the overall deposit beta.", "Jared Shaw", "That $53 million per 25 basis points, that's increased costs of interest expense?", "A - Daniel Beck 0", "No, that's the overall impact, improvement to net income of 25 basis points increase in short term rates.", "Jared Shaw", "Great, thanks. And then just finally for me, looking at the FX going rate, I hear what you said how it's ramped up through the year. Was there any sort of a venture impact this quarter or was it really just good blocking and tackling in you said better margins and overall volumes?", "Gregory Becker", "Yeah, I would say consistent margins. It wasn't better margins. And it was I would say blocking and tackling. We continue to invest in that area and will continue to invest in it on a go forward basis. We have both domestically and internationally the client base that utilizes foreign currency exchange spot and forwards and options. And we expect the volumes to be solid although obviously you could see variations on a quarter to quarter basis, but we still think it's going to be up and to the right based on our market and our team.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Brett Rabatin from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Brett Rabatin", "Wanted to ask, you had substantial growth in the capital call lines of credit business, but you did have better growth in software this quarter. So, I'm just curious, thinking about the pipeline for the next year, do you anticipate the capital call line of business continuing to increase in terms of the overall percentage of the loan book? And I know the debt and equity markets are very competitive, but as you look out, is there anything that might change that dynamic where you can be more fruitful in your growth in your other core business lines?", "Gregory Becker", "Let me start, I'll just briefly talk about the private equity part of our business, the capital call lines. Then I'm going to ask Mike Ducheneaux to add commentary on the tech and life sciences. So, we continue to see growth in the private equity capital call lines and just the one point to remember is that that is such a larger market than the venture capital market. We still have market share upside there that we believe has the opportunities to grow for years to come. We have an incredibly strong team, differentiated service and feel really good about that. The other part is, it's very diversified when you think about the target clients that we have in that. These are firms going after -- they're fund to funds, they're buyout firms doing small to midmarket stuff, they are oil and gas, they are other natural resources. So, it's very diversified in a very healthy and growing market. And with our low market share we again still feel we have upside, but I'll let Mike talk about where we saw kind of the Q3 software technology growth and the outlook.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Sure, thanks, Greg. So, Brett, when we think about where we've come, if you remember 2016 was somewhat of a challenging year with the recalibration going on. Growth as you've seen amongst our technology portfolio has been challenged. It's essentially been flat year-over-year. So, as we go into 2018, we feel really good about our pipeline and what's happening. And coupled with the fact that we've been hit quite a bit lately with M&A transactions as well which has held back some of our growth in the tech portfolio. As we go into 2018, I think you can definitely see some of these pipelines coming into turning into some loans there as well. The other thing to think and keep in mind is we also have the plans for Germany and Canada start to potentially come online next year as well. The rest of the global operations in the UK continue to do really strong as well, so when you're coming back to your first question which was essentially as a percentage of the total loan portfolio in the PES, will that continue to be the same or grow? It looks like it won't necessarily grow as percentage so much in terms of proportion to the entire loan portfolio because this year, or going into 2018, we expect robust growth from the other areas such as the tech. And then you add in private bank as well which is doing quite well and will continue to grow. So, I think certainly the pace of PES as an annual year-over-year growth will continue to be strong. But again, I think the other areas will continue to pick up as we move into 2018.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay, that's great colour on that. Then I guess I want to make sure I understood the guidance around the fourth quarter fee income. It sounded like, if I heard correctly, you are going to come in on the lower end of the high teens growth for the year and so in 4Q that would sort of mean kind of flattish to maybe slightly lower fee income. I want to make sure that wasn't the case, and would there be any pressure on lending fees that were really strong in 3Q or maybe even a little more colour on the overall number.", "Daniel Beck", "On an overall basis, it is slightly up Q3 to Q4. At least based on where we see things right now. And you were correct in terms of the overall guidance and where we expect things to be for the quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jennifer Demba from SunTrust Robinson. Your line is open.", "Jennifer Demba", "Question on the private banking efforts. Sounds like you're still in the early innings there. What percentage of your customers are banking with you in this area?", "Gregory Becker", "So, this is Greg. I'll start and Mike may want to add something. It is a small percentage still. The one area we do have I would say higher market share is in the venture capital partners. I don't have the percentage right off the top of my head, but that's probably I would guess probably 25%, 30% market share there. But in the rest of the area, whether it's private equity or if you see it in our commercial client base, the technology companies and life science companies, that actually is on the smaller side. As I go back and think about my comments, that's why I made a point to say that I believe we're only scratching the surface. We're getting really positive feedback from our clients when we do approach them with the private bank, so we need to build out our team, we need to build out our capabilities, we need to build our digital platform. And with all those things kind of on the docket to happen, that's why we believe there's just a lot of growth potential in that part of the business.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Jennifer, I'd just add, we have about 2,000 clients in our private bank, somewhere around there. And as Greg alluded to, we've done exceptionally well as far as connecting with the venture capital community in terms of the private bank. Where we see the opportunity is to connect even more with I would say the C-level suites of our technology companies. Which as you know, we have a lot more technology companies as well so much that we can grow that portfolio. So those are some of the areas that we'll continue to focus on as we go onto 2018.", "Jennifer Demba", "How long do too think it will be before you can get these capabilities built out to where you'd like them to be?", "Michael Descheneaux", "Just from a private banking side, so for example the core of what we do currently is with mortgages, right? So, it really is about just enhancing the relationships between our private bank and our commercial bankers in order to get that referral pipeline coming into the private bank as well too. So, we believe we have the basic product set that we need to do, it's more just on executing on the sales side of the equation.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris McGratty from KBW. Your line is open. ", "Chris McGratty", "Greg, maybe a question -- it seems like a couple of quarters ago we were asking you about needing capital or coming to the market for capital. But with obviously the good underlying earnings momentum and obviously the potential for tax reform, how are you thinking about potentially returning capital to shareholders over time?", "Gregory Becker", "I'll start, Chris, at a high level. It is interesting how fast things change where it was not that long ago when people were asking us questions about capital raise. So, I think we look at it and say we are in a position now that we are obviously in a better position than we maybe ever have been. Or at least starting that trend. As far as how we think about that, we're just starting the discussion and starting to think through that and what that would look like. You wouldn't from my standpoint see anything that is going to happen in the next few quarters. But when you get towards, again, some of these things continue to perform, you'll probably hear us talking about it more in I would say probably Q3 or Q4. Not that something is going to happen then, but that we're starting to describe what it will look like. So, I would say just hold tight for a few quarters and we'll be able to share kind of our outlook when we get there.", "Chris McGratty", "That's helpful, thanks. Maybe on taxes, you talked about the potential for a muni strategy in the investment portfolio. I would imagine you're going to wait until you get some clarity on taxes. And also, if you could, what should we be expecting for the tax rate notwithstanding any changes out of Washington?", "Daniel Beck", "This is Dan. So obviously paying attention to what's happening in Washington and not going to execute on a large strategy until we have a view there. We have been investing already in municipal bonds as well as low income housing tax credits, so those things are there. And obviously that will be a thing that we would focus on should we get clarity of what's happening in Washington. In terms of overall effective tax rate on a go forward basis, the level that we're at, at least in the third quarter, is somewhat representative of what our run rate tax rate looks like. As we of course had in the first and second quarter, the overall equity compensation, impacts of the accounting change drove down that rate. So, you'll probably see a little bit more of that in the first and second quarter of next year, but the run rate effective tax rate is right now, absent that tax strategy, pretty similar to what we have in Q3.", "Chris McGratty", "Great. And just to make sure I heard you, Dan, on the question about each 25-basis point, that $53 million, was that a net interest income or a net income pre-tax...", "Daniel Beck", "That is pre-tax net income number.", "Chris McGratty", "That doesn't factor into any kind of momentum that you're seeing in the CIF growth rate, right? That's in addition to that, is that right?", "Daniel Beck", "That is a static view of the balance sheet.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. ", "Geoffrey Elliott", "There's been a few articles talking about capital call lending and private equity and specifically some concern that some funds have used capital call lines to enhance the IRR. Can you give us some thoughts around how long those lines are typically drawn for by you clients and whether you think there is any regulatory risk there or risk of changes in borrower behaviour?", "Marc Cadieux", "This is Marc Cadieux, I'll take that. So, there's a couple of questions wrapped up there. First is that we are aware of that commentary from representatives of the LP community about private equity funds using capital call lines to improve the return of their funds. This isn't new phenomena. It's something that's been talked about before. As far as we can tell, it's not a concern or a commentary that's getting any traction in terms of a change in behaviour. That's the first thing. Second, on average, borrowings from private equity funds still remain relatively short. Advances tend to be out on average between 180 and 270 days. And while longer than what venture capitalists borrow, it's still relatively short-term borrowing. The last question, I think this is reflected in our guidance and some of the earlier comments, is we do not anticipate any meaningful noticeable behaviour change among private equity funds and how they utilize capital call lines of credit.", "Geoffrey Elliott", "Thanks. Then just to clarify on one of the questions earlier, within loan growth, are you still expecting private equity and venture capital overall to grow faster than the rest of the portfolio but still expect it to gain share within total loans?", "Gregory Becker", "This is Greg. As Mike described, we do believe that the other parts of the business, private banking, the core tech and life science part of the business in global, will pick up from where it's been a little bit slower, especially the tech side, so that it could be in balance with the percentage of the portfolio, it may stay in line. That being said, we have as you know, for the last several years seen stronger growth in private equity services, in the private equity part of the business. And that could continue and we're comfortable with that. So, we're comfortable if the 42% goes up to a higher number. In our plans we don't have it playing out that way, but if it does, because it could be very robust as it has been, if it goes higher, we'd be comfortable with that.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Tyler Stafford from Stephens Incorporate. Your line is open. ", "Tyler Stafford", "Just sticking with the capital call lines, do you have the percentage breakdown between PE and VC of the capital call book? And what the average new production yields out of which of those are?", "Marc Cadieux", "Sure, it's Marc again. So, in terms of the funded balances, it's an 80/20, 80% private equity funds, 20% venture capital. And we think just relative to where the growth is coming from, that we'll continue to see it tilt towards private equity more so than venture capital. With regard to your question on the interest rate on those, for the portfolio overall, it's in the low to mid 3% range with roughly about a 40 to 50 basis point speared between private equity and venture capital, i.e., the private equity tends to be about 40 or 5 basis points lower on average than the venture capital funds.", "Tyler Stafford", "Thanks for that, Marc. With the growth that you've seen out of that book, it's now I guess what 42% or so of the total, and given just the fact that you've had no losses virtually out of that portfolio the last decade, and then with the credit profile of the private bank loans, should your reserve methodology begin to loosen on the overall portfolio to where you could actually see a lower overall allowance for loan losses to growth performing loans?", "Marc Cadieux", "So, in some respects you've already seen, not from a methodology standpoint, but in terms of the continued improvement in composition, from the growth coming from primarily our lower risk segments of the portfolio. You've seen that reflected in the loan loss reserve in terms of where it is now at that 112 basis points. Certainly, can't rule out the possibility that it could go lower if composition were to continue to improve, but having said that, there are, I think as recognized, we have pretty strong credit quality at present. So, while possible, it's certainly not an expectation that we would see it drift meaningfully lower.", "Michael Descheneaux", "The only one thing I would just caution, obviously it depends on the economic environment as well. Whether it's with respect to credit quality and similar to our comments on the growth side as well too. But all things being equal, you should start to see some improvement if we continue to grow the private equity portfolio as Marc described.", "Tyler Stafford", "Okay, thanks for that, Mike. And then just last one for me, if I'm doing the math correctly, the mid-teens expense guide for 2017 implies 4Q expenses are down sequentially from 3Q levels using that $860 million base for 2016. Am I thinking about that correctly?", "Daniel Beck", "As we look at the overall expense guidance, as we said back in the second quarter, we thought that run rate levels, excluding some of the one-time items, would be in that $245 million to $250 million range. If you back out some of the nonrecurring items in the third quarter, we'd be in a similar spot. So, we'd expect the business as usual run rate to be a little bit lower assuming that market conditions remain the same in the fourth quarter.", "Tyler Stafford", "And just to be clear, you are using the $860 million base for 2016, correct?", "Daniel Beck", "That is the base roughly.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from John Pancari from Evercore. Your line is open.", "John Pancari", "On the yields, the yield that you just gave for the PE and VC capital call portfolio, is that the average yield or the new money yield, that low to mid 3s?", "Marc Cadieux", "That was the average yield and I should point out it's an interest only yield, not inclusive of fees.", "John Pancari", "Okay. And the new money yield, is it near that rate?", "Marc Cadieux", "Yeah, it's pretty close, yeah.", "John Pancari", "Okay, then the same question for the other large portfolios if you could, particularly around the maybe early stage and later stage and then buyout portfolios for example?", "Gregory Becker", "Sure. So early stage, and here I'll just broaden that a bit to be investor dependent, early stage and later but companies that are still burning cash, still dependent on raising capital. The interest only yields there tend to be higher. They can range from 5% to as high as 7% or 8% and then in some segments of our portfolio can get into low double-digit territory on occasion. Moving to sort of the I'll say larger end, larger corporate, there you see rates that are more reflective of prime. And on average a little bit under that. And then finally you asked about sponsor buy-out, and their yields then to be the interest yields tend to be LIBOR plus 400 give or take depending on the deal profile.", "John Pancari", "Great, thanks. Then secondly, on the bond portfolio, just want to again get your plans for the bond book. You're looking to put more liquidity to work and at 40 -- what are you looking at, 47%, 48% of assets now, what's your longer-term target for the overall size of that book?", "Daniel Beck", "It's obviously dependent upon the overall liquidity position, but we don't expect any major changes to the overall composition and size of the investment securities portfolio. The only thing could be, as we look at the tax strategy, potentially reallocating a portion of that investment portfolio to more tax advantaged investments. But generally speaking, we've talked about it in the past, the primary purpose of that portfolio is for liquidity purposes and we generally think it's going to look the same in the future.", "John Pancari", "Okay. Then on that topic, what's the updated duration for that book and what's the updated monthly cash flow coming off it?", "Daniel Beck", "The overall duration is 2.7 and the overall cash flow coming off of that is about $1.2 billion a quarter.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Chris York from JMP Securities. Your line is open.", "Chris York", "LCD reported that you let a $102 million credit facility to Donuts to acquire Rightside Group in the third quarter. So, my question is twofold. First, what does the pipeline look like for those type of large transactions? And then two, maybe can you give us some colour on how to think about the trajectory for lending fees given the big increase in the quarter?", "Gregory Becker", "I'll start and others may want to weigh in. First, as you would appreciate, not intending to comment on specific clients and specific transactions. Generally speaking though and thinking of the several-year journey we've been on to improve our syndications capabilities, you do see that reflected in terms of our ability to hang onto and serve clients longer. And of course, one of the ways that you do that is by being credible in the syndications market, able to agent deals and bring other lenders into it. And I feel that we've come quite a long way over the last several years in that regard.", "Daniel Beck", "And I'll piggyback on that in terms of the overall lending fees. We mentioned in the earnings release as well as comments that we had an adjustment in the lending fee line item which was for the unfunded commitments. That, at least on a go-forward basis won't be there, at least in the size it was in the third quarter. So that was for about $4 million.", "Chris York", "Got it, that colour is very helpful. That's it for me. Thank you.", "Operator", "And our last question comes from David Chiaverini from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open. ", "David Chiaverini", "You mentioned the VC investment environment in the third quarter was mixed with the dollar in deals declining in the quarter. What type of VC investment and fundraising environment are you assuming that underpins your 2018 guidance?", "Gregory Becker", "This is Greg. Just to clarify, it is true that the number of companies were down slightly. The dollars were down modestly. I think it was $22 billion down to $21 billion, so I would say very healthy markets in Q2 and Q3. I think if you look at that as a run rate basis, we would expect that things remain consistent with that as an outlook. So, it remains at that level, maybe a slight improvement. That's what our outlook is based on.", "David Chiaverini", "Thanks. Then shifting gears, curious about the roughly $6 billion of money market deposits that you have on the balance sheet. How much of that is from your private bank and wealth management clients?", "Gregory Becker", "This is Greg. Very little. When you think about it, the total deposits that we have from private bank clients is in the overall scheme of things, when you look at the full $100 billion of total client funds roughly, it's small overall. And obviously the money market would be a small subset of that.", "David Chiaverini", "That makes sense. That's probably why the beta is staying so low. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "That concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to CEO Greg Becker for some brief closing comments.", "Gregory Becker", "Great. Thanks. I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. I'm incredibly proud of the record results we were able to describe to you and share with all of you today. It's easy for us to sit in this room and to share our numbers with you, but at the end of the days, it's not us. It's the 2,500 employees that we have around the country and around the world who do such an amazing job every day for our clients. You just think about the results over the last few years, they truly have done an incredible job, so I just want to thank all of them for their efforts. I also, as I have in prior calls, want to thank our clients. As I get to spend more time out in the market, with Mike taking on the President role, it is truly thrilling and I've said this all the time, I do believe I've got the best Bank CEO job in the world because we've got great employees and we have the best clients. We don't take that lightly. We truly appreciate the trust they have in us and that's really what has fuelled not only our success over the last several years, but it's why we're optimistic about our outlook. So again, I just want to thank everyone for joining us, great to deliver the results, and have a great, great day. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

My name is Brandon, and I'll be your operator for today's call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note this conference is being recorded.", "And I would now turn it over to Meghan O'Leary. Meghan, you may begin.", "Meghan O'Leary", "Thank you, Brandon, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. Our President and CEO, Greg Becker, and our CFO, Dan Beck, are here to talk about our fourth quarter and full-year 2017 financial results and will be joined by other members of management for the Q&A.", "Our current earnings release is available on the Investor Relations section of our website at svb.com. We'll be making some forward-looking statements during this call, and actual results may differ materially. We encourage you to review the disclaimer in our earnings release dealing with forward-looking information, which applies equally to statements made in this call.", "In addition, some of our discussion may include references to non-GAAP financial measures. Information about those measures, including reconciliation to GAAP measures, may be found in our SEC filings and in our earnings release. We expect the call, including Q&A, to last approximately an hour.", "And with that, I will turn the call over to Greg Becker.", "Gregory Becker", "Thank you, Meghan, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. Our fourth quarter was an excellent finish to an outstanding year. We delivered earnings per share of $2.19, net income of $117 million, driven by healthy balance sheet growth, higher net interest income, and net margin, solid core fee income and stable credit.", "Our results also reflect the impact of $38 million in tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Job Act and a $9 million loss related to the sale of securities as part of our treasury and tax management objectives. Together these items equate to $0.80 per share. For the full-year 2017 we had earnings per share of $9.20 versus $7.31 in the prior year and we net income by 28% to $491 million.", "2017 was marked by strong growth across most aspects of our business. Net interest income increased by 24% to $1.4 billion, average loans grew by 16% to $21.2 billion, average total client funds grew by 15% to $94 billion and for the first time period end total client funds exceeded $100 billion. Core fee income grew by 20% to $379 million and we delivered a healthy return on equity of 12.4%.", "Our strong performance indicates that the environment for our business remains positive. We are enjoying one of the largest market expansions in history with the best performance across the Dow, the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ in four years. Venture capital just finished one of its best years ever with $84 billion invested the highest level since 2,000 and more than $30 billion raised for the fourth year.", "This positive activity translated into growth capital and liquidity for innovation companies, which contributed to strong new client activity and growth in our business. We added nearly 5,000 new core commercial clients in 2017 growing our net early stage client count and our total net client count by 15%. This included 25% net new client growth in private bank and 21% growth in private bank loan balances and 17% net new client growth in private equity with 29% growth in loan balances.", "It also included a win rate of middle market corporate finance clients that was nearly double the rate of any prior year. We had an outstanding year in core fee business as well due to strong market conditions and a focused plan to improve our outreach and client engagement.", "We exceeded $30 billion in FX volume and more than 30% increase year-over-year and ended the year with a record breaking quarterly revenue of $34 million. We surpassed $4.5 billion in annual card transactions for 2017, a 31% increase over 2016 and we now rank as the 15th largest commercial card issuer in the United States.", "All together we processed nearly $1.3 trillion in payments volume in 2017, a 25% increase over 2016. We are proud of these results and our momentum is reflected in our outlook for 2018 which Dan will go into detail in a few minutes. For the first time in years, we are enjoying a number of meaningful tailwinds.", "The first tailwind is interest rates. After several dovish rate hikes in 2017, the more confident tone of the Fed's commentary around December's rate hike was a welcome change. While SVB's outlook for the Street assumes no rate increases given our high asset sensitivity, we are likely to benefit from each successive rate increase.", "The second tailwind is the new corporate tax rate which took effect January 1. We expect our normalized tax rate to go from 40% to between 27% and 30% in 2018. The majority of these tax savings, 75% to 80% will go to our bottom line. The remaining 20% to 25% we plan to invest in our growth, infrastructure, and employee enablement, and neutralizing some of the negative impacts of tax reform on our employees.", "The final tailwind is regulatory reform, specifically the potential of lifting the threshold for CCAR compliance. While we will continue to be subject to many other regulatory requirements of being a global bank, we believe this change will enable us to focus more management time and attention on some of our growth and client engagement activities. While we believe the year ahead holds positive opportunities, we continue to monitor the more challenging aspects of the environment. A challenge for all banks is fierce competition from banks from non-banks and from equity.", "The availability of equity in particular has been a headwind for loan growth and believes this state of things is here to stay. We continue to win our share of deals and the majority of deals we want, but we remain focused on smart growth and making the most of our unique advantages in the market. Another challenge is the exit markets, which have not returned with the strength many, including us had predicted in 2017.", "Later stage companies took advantage of large private equity infusions rather than go public. While the availability of capital for these companies is a positive story overall, the lack of public exits could become an issue for venture capital investors if it continues. In addition, the lackluster pace of exits, combined with these large private equity infusions is driving valuations for some private companies to levels that are hard to justify.", "If we were to see a significant decline in VC funding, or a growing trend of exits below the last private round, it would likely affect the broader universe of venture-backed companies, which could mean higher credit costs for us. Despite these factors, we remain positive about our prospects for 2018. We have five top priorities for the year, areas where we will be focusing and investing.", "First, raising the bar on client engagement by investing in systems, process and improvements, people analytics that will enable us to connect with clients in a more meaningful way.", "Second, improving our process, procedures, and technology to help our employees to do their jobs more efficiently and effectively.", "Third, continuing to invest to support long-term growth across the platform, including private bank, global, life sciences, private equity, and early stage client acquisition.", "Fourth, growing our fee income by improving product penetration enhancing the ability of our teams to meet the needs of specific client segments and partnering with and leveraging the capabilities of our innovative FinTech clients.", "And fifth, enhancing risk management across the organization.", "We are pleased and proud of the results for the quarter and the year and are very optimistic in our outlook for 2018. We are fortunate to have an amazing group of dedicated employees, who live SVB's mission every day. We work with the most innovative, creative clients anywhere. And we are at the center of a robust and resilient ecosystem that continues to grow and expand.", "Thank you, and now I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Dan Beck.", "Daniel Beck", "Good afternoon, everyone. Our excellent quarterly results were a continuation of the trend we've seen throughout the year, the healthy venture capital and private equity environment and a strong overall economy are driving robust client liquidity and we are executing effectively on our strategy.", "The quarter included the following highlights. One, strong growth in net interest income due to healthy balance sheet growth and higher yields from our investment securities portfolio. Two, strong client funds balance growth. Three, higher core fee income driven primarily by foreign exchange transaction volumes and higher total client fund balances. Four, stable credit with solid underlying trends. Five, somewhat higher expenses related to incentives tied to our strong performance, and six, continued strong levels of capital and liquidity with some slower growth and on balance sheet deposits.", "As Greg indicated, these results were partially offset by certain items related to tax reform, including a $37.6 million tax expense from a one-time valuation adjustment of deferred tax assets to reflect the recently enacted change in the corporate federal tax rate.", "In addition, we had pre-tax losses of $8.8 million on the sale of $573 million, investment securities for treasury and tax management objectives. I'll refer you to the 8-K that we filed in December and our earnings release for further information on these impacts.", "Now let's turn to our operating results. Starting with the balance sheet, average loans increased by $859 million or 4% to $22.4 billion driven primarily by private equity capital call lines and technology lending, despite continued competition in abundant liquidity in the market.", "Average total client funds grew by $5 billion or 5.2%, so $102 billion, $0.4 billion due to the continued strong new client acquisition, a robust equity funding environment along with a better IPO activity and secondary public offering activity for our clients, the rising rate environment and the wide availability of equity funding for private companies, meaning that we are seeing a heightened awareness among our early stage client of options for their excess liquidity.", "In the fourth quarter that translated into more early stage client proactively moving excess funds into higher yielding off balance sheet options than what we experience and in no rate increase environment. These are clients who we would fully expect to see move off the balance sheet. Those with excess cash balances, but they are now doing so with less lag time than earlier this year, in the early stages of the rate increase cycle.", "We expect this trend to continue as rates increase. This trend was reflected in average deposit growth of $731 million or 1.7% an average off balance sheet client funds growth of $4.3 billion or 8.1%. We expect this shift towards off balance sheet growth to continue and believe with the loan to deposit ratio 50% and extremely strong client liquidity overall that we have substantial liquidity to support our growth.", "Average assets grew by $1 billion or 2% to $50.8 billion and period end assets were $51.2 billion. We expect to cross the trailing four quarter $50 billion SIFI threshold in Q1 2018 and to be subject to the enhanced potential standard starting in Q2 2018. This means we expect to file a public CCAR in 2020.", "While we are positively inclined to believe that there will be some regulatory relief on the SIFI threshold, as a growing regulated entity were subject to multiple regulation and anticipate the continued expansion of our regulatory requirement. To that end, we remain focused on the SIFI threshold and monitoring our level of foreign exposure, specifically, the $10 billion threshold for internationally active banks. As we continue to see strong growth in our foreign operations.", "We have strategies to optimize our exposure without curtailing growth and we are also engaged in discussions with regulators and legislators on this topic. As of December 31, 2017, we have approximately $6 billion in foreign exposure as defined by the rule, leaving a healthy amount of headroom for continued growth.", "Now I'd like to turn to the income statement. Net interest income increased by $20.7 million or 5.5% to $395 million due to strong balance sheet growth and higher rates particularly from reinvestment in our fixed income portfolio.", "Higher loan balances and higher interest rates driven increase in interest income from a loan of $11.4 million to $280 million in the fourth quarter. In the investment portfolio, higher balances and higher yield drove an increase in interest income of $10.8 million to $122 million.", "Average gross loan yield excluding interest recoveries and loan fees increased by 2 basis points to 4.32% primarily due to previous rate increases. Our net interest margin increased by 10 basis points to 3.2% due primarily to higher loan and investment yields.", "Now I'll move to credit quality, which remains stable with good underlying trends. Our provision for credit losses was $22.2 million compared to $23.5 million in the third quarter. This consisted of $10.8 million in net new specific reserves for non-accrual loans, $8.2 million for loan growth and $3.5 million for unfunded credit commitments.", "Net charge-offs were $12.9 million or 23 basis points of total average loans, compared to $10.5 million and 19 basis points in Q3. Charge-offs came primarily from early stage software loans. We continue to see good overall performance across the portfolio, although high valuations and soft exit markets still pose a risk for early stage credit.", "Now I'11 turn to non-interest income, which is composed of core fee income, gains from private equity and venture capital related investments and gains from warrants. GAAP non-interest income was $152.3 million, compared to $158.8 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP non-interest income net of non-controlling interest was $144.5 million, a decrease of $8.7 million from the prior quarter. This decrease was primarily due to lower warrant gains in the fourth quarter relative to the strong gains in the third quarter and was partially offset by increases across most core fee income categories.", "Core fee income increased by $3.7 million or 3.6% to $106.4 million. This growth was driven primarily by foreign exchange fees which increased by $4.1 million due to robust levels of activity particularly from client actively managing currency exposure and client investment fees which increased $3 million due to higher client investment fund balances from our client strong liquidity.", "These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $5 million in lending related fees primarily due to a non-recurring $4.5 million adjustment in the third quarter from prior period fees and unused lines of credit. Net gains on investment securities net of non-controlling interest were $8 million compared to $9.7 million in the prior quarter. This was primarily due to valuation gains from IPO and M&A activity. These gains were partially offset by net losses of $5.6 million from our available for sale portfolio sales which included the $8.8 million loss on sales related to our treasury and tax management objectives that I noted earlier.", "As a result of our 2018 adoption of the new accounting standards related to financial instruments that eliminates cost method accounting for equity investments. We will record approximately $100 million on a pre-tax basis as positive fair value adjustment to equity reflective of previously unrecognized gains for the impacted investments. In the past, the gains on these investments were recognized as income only when there was a monetization event.", "As a result of this change going forward we anticipate a reduction in gains on investment securities in the range of $2 to $3 million per quarter at the aggregate value of the gains have now been captured in equity. Effective January 1, 2018 we will mark these investments previously held the cost to fair value with all changes in value being recognized in the income statement.", "Moving to equity warrant gains, they were $12.1 million compared to $24.9 million in the third quarter. The notable item for equity warrant gains is our positions in Roku which contributed $4.8 million in gains for the fourth quarter and $16 million in gains for the third quarter. Given the size of our holdings in Roku I'd like to provide some additional color. We hold directly through the exercise of warrants previously held by us and indirectly through interest and certain fund investment approximately 1.7 million shares of Roku's common stock.", "As noted in our earnings release for the full-year 2017 we recognized approximately $70 million of total value appreciation related to Roku of which approximately $30 million was recognized for the income statement with the remaining $40 million recorded in equity on our balance sheet based on its closing price of $51.78 on December 31, 2017. However, the value of these holdings remains subject to market fluctuations that will continue to flow through earnings until the sale of the position.", "Turning to expenses non-interest expense was $264 million compared to $257.8 million in the third quarter. This increase is primary related to higher incentive compensation costs due to our strong performance and higher professional services costs associated with their global digital banking initiative. As we said previously we expect our efficiency ratio to trend down over time and we are committed to drive scalability in efficiency in our back office to make that happen.", "Now turning to taxes. Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter was 53.5%, compared to 39.6% in the third quarter due to the revaluation of tax assets as I mentioned earlier. Normalized for the write-down of these taxes, our effective tax rate was 38% for the fourth quarter.", "Now moving on to capital. Capital and liquidity remained very healthy. Although growth in risk weighted assets due to loan and investments and higher unused loan commitments lowered risk based capital ratio somewhat. The Tier-1 leverage ratio at the bank was 7.56% and remains well within our target for range.", "Now I'd like to move to discuss or 2018 outlook and update the preliminary outlook we provided in October. This outlook is for the full-year 2018 versus the full-year 2017. Balance sheet growth rates are based on full-year averages. Our outlook reflects the impact of the Fed funds rate increases to date, but assumes no further rate increases in 2018. Finally, this outlook is based on our current forecast and assumptions about market condition and it's subject to change.", "Starting with loans, consistent with our preliminary outlook, we expect average loan balances to grow at a percentage rate in the mid-teens. For average deposits, we are lowering our outlook to the mid single-digits from the low double-digits. Liquidity among our clients remains robust. However, we expect clients will continue to proactively seek higher yields for their excess deposits and our off balance sheet offerings as I described earlier.", "We expect net interest income to grow at a percentage rate in the high-teens. That is at the low end of our preliminary outlook range based on expected deposit growth. If rates were to rise according to the forward curve, we'd expect net interest income growth in the low 20s. We expect our net interest margin for the full-year could be between 3.35% and 3.45%. If rates were to rise consistent with the forward curve, we'd expect net interest margin to be between 3.45% and 3.55%.", "We expect credit quality to remain stable and comparable to 2017 levels. Specifically, we expect net loan charge-offs between 30 basis points and 50 basis points of average total gross loans. We expect the non-performing loans between 50 basis points and 70 basis points of total gross loans, and we expect our allowance for loan losses for performing loans to be comparable to 2017 levels.", "We have narrowed our outlook for core fee income to the high end of our preliminary range of growth at a percentage rate in the high-teens consistent with 2017. As Greg indicated in his comments, we plan to use some of our tax savings for investments and growth, infrastructure and employees. As a result, we are raising our outlook for non-interest expense from the high single-digits to the low double-digits. That said, we still expect 75% to 80% of the tax reform benefit to translate to earnings. As Greg also indicated, we've added an effective tax rate outlook for 2018 between 27% and 30%.", "To wrap up, we are pleased with the performance for the quarter and for the year. Our core business remains robust, reflecting the general good health of our clients as well as their access to funding in liquidity in a strong economy. We continue to deliver healthy revenue growth, solid ROE and efficiency ratios, all underscored by high asset quality. We expect these positive trends that continue through 2018 assuming the macro environment does not change materially. Should future rate increases materialize, we would expect to see upside to our current outlook. In the meantime, we remain focused on delivering high quality growth, and we have ample capital and liquidity to support that growth.", "Thank you. And now I'll ask the operator to open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Morgan Stanley, we have Ken Zerbe. Please go ahead.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Great. Thanks. Good evening.", "Gregory Becker", "Hey, Ken.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "I guess just to start off, and in terms of the client investment funds, obviously congrats on getting over $100 billion which is impressive, but is there any way - maybe I'm trying to ask like, are you happy with the revenues that you're generating from the entirety of your client investment funds? Obviously, the off-balance sheet stuff is what I'm referring to. Like is there any way the U.K. as clients continue to pull money out of sort of on-balance sheet to off, can you monetize that in a better way to generate higher fee income from that piece? Thanks.", "Gregory Becker", "So Ken, this is Greg. I'll start, Daniel would add. I think, first you've to understand what that cash is, it truly is set up for investments in cash like instruments over time that are very safe and secure. And so when you're doing that, obviously, the margins that are there are tend to begin with. So we set out and we've been pretty clear about this and we think we're on the right track, which is we're running about 13 basis points right now, and maybe able to get an additional 1 basis point per 25 for a few more rate increases, and then we'll probably cap out maybe at 15 basis points, maybe a little bit at 16 basis points.", "So if there were 3 more basis point increases during the course of the year, our three rate increases this year maybe you could get up to 16% or 16 basis points on average, right. I don't see a lot of ability to go much further than that because of what the investments are being made in. There's a second question though, which actually is, is there a way to direct more of what's going to the off-balance sheet on to the balance sheet. But what's appropriate for clients.", "I'm going to start there, because it is very important, meaning there may be some opportunities to move some of those higher balances that are off-balance sheet, on to their on-balance sheet and actually pay a reasonable return for that on the balance sheet. But still be able to drive a very strong ROE from those deposits. We're looking at that. We think there's an opportunity there, but that isn't factored into our forecast.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Got it, okay. That definitely helps. And then just the other question as you do so qualify for becoming a SIFI, over the next quarter or so. Is there any obvious expenses that you need to incur in first quarter or second quarter were your expense guidance might be shifted a little more towards the first half of the year?", "Daniel Beck", "This is Dan. So the expenses that were expected or baked into our outlook and there's no periodic expenses that we're going to incur in the first couple quarters related to that compliance. So I think you'll see a pretty even burn rate of that expense throughout the year.", "Kenneth Zerbe", "Great, all right. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Bank of America Merrill Lynch, we have Ebrahim Poonawala. Please go ahead.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Good afternoon, guys. Just Dan, if you can go to the expense guidance and the increase relative to October, is it all entirely driven off of - because of the tax reform, you feel like you can make more investments and so why not do it or what the other sort of drivers of why the guide - it has moved higher?", "Daniel Beck", "That's a great question. And it's all related to tax reform. We definitely see those in opportunity to invest in employees and the overall infrastructure for employee enablement. So we think it's a great time. It's a great opportunity and that's where that's coming from.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "And as we sort of think about it means clearly if the forward curve plays out and I should be more in the low to mid 20% growth rate. Can you talk about drivers of what would push the expense going to guide higher because that tends to be sort of point of I guess uncertainty even revenue growth picks up for you guys. I just want to handicap the risk of that expense growth, moving higher as we move through 2018?", "Daniel Beck", "So yes, I'll take that and Greg might want to add to it. So as we look at the expense baseline for 2017, we already have embedded in that higher incentive compensation costs related to our good ROE performance, investments and infrastructure for regulatory compliance and for continued business growth.", "So that that's a very good baseline for us, then on top of that we're building a low-teens expense growth to be able to continue to support the growth in the franchise. So we feel pretty strongly that the guidance in the outlook supports what we plan to do in 2018 with the growth of the franchise, with a very high ROE and strong performance. So we feel really good about the expense guide.", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, the only thing I would add on to it is that we have built-in not only just dollars or projects in across the board client experience and employee enablement. We also have some headcount growth built in there as well that we feel very comfortable with both domestically and globally.", "And so I think we feel good about the broad base expenses that are already factored into the number. And so I feel very good saying there should be surprises and if there are surprises to the number everybody should be happy because it means that we are dramatically outperforming the forecast that we're giving.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Very clear, and just moving separately Dan, now that we've got clarity on tax reform, maybe we've seen some steeping in the yield curve. Could you sort of give us an update on the strategy on the bond portfolio, what we're investing into and are you actively looking to extended duration as we moved through the year?", "Daniel Beck", "Yes, that's a great question. So as we're looking at over our duration, you saw a bit of extension in the portfolio in the last quarter. So move from 2.7 years up to 3 years. As we continue to purchase the bond portfolio, runs off let's say roughly about $1 billion a quarter. We're buying out in the let's call it four to six year range.", "So you'll see a general creep up in duration as we move into 2018. On top of that as a part of those purchases we're buying, let's call it in a range of $200 million to $300 million of municipal bonds based on the availability in the marketplace. That also has a tendency to extend bit duration as well to improve yields and obviously provide the tax benefit. So that's what you should expect to see from the investment portfolio in 2018.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "And can you sort of frame for us in terms what's the new yields versus what's rolling off just so that we get in a sense of how much we are adding incrementally every quarter as the $1 billion gets - some of the get reinvestment?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, I think the best way to think about it is about 100 basis points roughly let's call it 90 to 100 basis points improvement on that billion every quarter.", "Ebrahim Poonawala", "Understood. That's all my questions.", "Operator", "From JPMorgan we have Steven Alexopoulos. Please go ahead.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Hi, everybody.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Steven.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "And I wanted to start regarding the accounting changes cited the 100 million valuation adjustment, I want to make sure I understand that, is that in the funds business and the portion that the bank receives? That didn't sound like in impacted warrants at all?", "Daniel Beck", "No it doesn't impact warrants and it impacts the fund investment.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. And you said you expect that to go down to did you say $2 to $3 million per quarter?", "Daniel Beck", "Yes, we're recognizing these were previously held that cost. So recognizing $100 million worth of value as of the beginning of January based on those investments. You would have seen that with the point of distribution flow through the income statement at a general pace of let's call it $2 to $3 million a quarter. So we're likely to see because of that value that we are going to book in January. You're likely to see a little bit of degradation in non-interest income from that.", "Gregory Becker", "So Steve, this is Greg, just to clarify because I want to make sure that what you asked was the right which is it's a decline from where it is of $2 to $3 million per quarter it's not $2 to $3 million per quarter and we expect okay big difference.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay, yes, that is a big difference. Okay. Greg, look at it the $5.5 billion in client fund inflows which I think I've asked should last two quarters, because you've been over almost $5 billion for three quarters in a row? What's driving it at that such an elevated pace and do you think it's sustainable?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, so there a couple things obviously when you look at the overall venture capital fund flow for last year again it was $84 billion. So again second highest on record going back to 2000 so you had a start there. So that the pool of money is available is just from venture is a big number that's just part of the story right. Because get a part of the story is you still have corporate that are coming in bigger you have more angels coming in bigger and you have the sovereign wealth funds. The amount and breath of availability of capital is very substantial that's one piece.", "Second piece relates to you know I think we used our teams are doing an excellent job of just calling on the right companies with the higher balances and so you can look at both right to get a big population of money coming in and very good execution on our team side that's really been the driver of the incredible client fund's growth.", "The second question is what is the outlook look like? We certainly believe that the outlook for 2018 is still going to be healthy it's obviously hard for us to predict is it going to be higher than $84 billion or lower than $84 billion I would just say we feel pretty comfortable it's going to be a another really good year. So it's kind of the context that I'd give you.", "Michael Descheneaux", "Maybe one other thing Steve, this is Mike Descheneaux here -- to think about as well is with the recent tax reforms as well and the talk about repatriation of those significant amounts of money that are overseas that are going to come back, whether it's to the corporates and the corporates deploy it out into our ecosystem as well. So that's something to keep an eye on as well that could potentially help support the flow of funds as well.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Nice to hear from you Mike. Just one on taxes, regarding the tax rate going down to 27% to 30%. Dan I know you've been working on different tax strategies is that fully baked that in the cake or could this range move even lower? Thanks.", "Daniel Beck", "That bakes into the cake for 2018 what we expect in terms of implementation of the strategies for the next year. Obviously with the purchases of municipal bonds throughout of the year that impact will grow and the full-year impact in the next year could be a little bit better. But that, that bakes in what the plan is in terms of our municipal bonds and other strategies.", "Steven Alexopoulos", "Okay. Terrific. Thanks for all the color.", "Gregory Becker", "Thank you, Steven.", "Operator", "From Wells Fargo Securities we have Jared Shaw. Please go ahead.", "Jared Shaw", "Hi, good evening.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Jared.", "Jared Shaw", "Maybe be just sticking with the security side, when you look at the securities loss this quarter was that - that was just a tax opportunity restructuring, is that the way to think about that, are we taking some of the losses now? And then, was that basically restructured or reinvested in similar securities?", "Daniel Beck", "Yes. This is Dan. That's exactly what it was. We had an opportunity. We had some lower rate securities purchased before improvements in the rate, while at the same time having to the tax opportunities. So the combination of the two things, we thought it was a unique time to execute sales in the portfolio.", "Jared Shaw", "Okay. And then on the muni side, given the change in tax rates make that incrementally less attractive from a pure tax planning strategy. How big could we expect to see muni's as a percentage of the securities book grow?", "Daniel Beck", "It will remain a small portion of the investment securities portfolio. As we're moving forward with time, we're obviously paying attention to what rates we can get there and what the tax opportunities are. We're growing that as I mentioned before in the - let's call it $200 million to $300 million range, but obviously, the volume and the supply dictate how far we are going there with that.", "Jared Shaw", "Great. And then just finally for me, when you look at the professional services at year-over-year growth, how much of the - that there's a large component that is based on the global growth opportunities? So how much of that is due to the SIFI preparing for the SIFI threshold?", "Daniel Beck", "I'll give you the total amount at least that we're spending on the CCAR implementation which is one of the largest components of the enhanced prudential standards SIFI implementation. And that amount in fourth quarter 2017 and let's call it $10 million to $11 million range. So as we look ahead, anticipation as that we are going to be in the - let's call it $11 million to $13 million range of which we would say 60% to 70% is really professional service spend.", "Jared Shaw", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "From Evercore ISI, we have John Pancari. Please go ahead.", "Rahul Patil", "Yes. This is Rahul Patil on behalf of John. Quick question on NII growth outlook. You recently provided growth outlook of high-teens to low-20s, it did not assume a December rate hike, and today you lowered the NII growth outlook to high-teens with December rate hike in the numbers. I'm just wondering like what changed in your assumptions over the past couple of months to bring about this differential cost? It you look like you're adding high yielding securities going forward, so where is the downside coming from?", "Daniel Beck", "Yes. The downside is coming from the deposit forecast, so the movement in the deposit range to the mid-single digits is really the driver there that offsets the benefit of the December move.", "Rahul Patil", "Okay. And then on the deposit side, I mean your deposit costs have been - have held up relatively well. Could you talk about any pricing changes already put in place or planned following the December rate hike, and then maybe talk about your beta expectation over the next couple of rate hikes?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes. This is Greg. We haven't seen a very - well really any change with the deposit costs from kind of Q2 to Q3 to Q4. Our modeling we're kind of looking at about a 35% deposit beta and obviously that impacts what you'd have on your interest bearing account, but even that with a 25 basis point rate increase you're still talking about a very low cost of funds going from interest bearing 12 basis points, but maybe it's up another maybe it's an additional 6 basis points, or 7 basis points, or 8 basis points on top of that, but it's still relatively low.", "As I mentioned, in one of the earlier questions, we are looking at - how can we direct some of the off-balance sheet on and what would it take to pay appropriately to incentivize those clients to move it on, and how do we make sure that it's both the right thing for a client and the right thing for us in ROE perspective. That's where we're going through right now. That's not factored into our outlook, but obviously more to come in future quarters as that plan starts to materialize.", "Rahul Patil", "All right. Thank you.", "Operator", "From KBW, we have Chris McGratty. Please go ahead.", "Christopher McGratty", "Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Chris.", "Christopher McGratty", "Hey, Greg. Last quarter, I asked you about capital return, you've got this capital benefit, you've got taxes coming down and rates going up. How are you thinking about capital return given the balance sheet shifting and the capital accumulation is occurring? Thanks.", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, it's a great question. And if you think about from a prioritization perspective, here's how I would look at it, right. So the first part, it has to be, how do you optimize the balance sheet? And is there a better ways to as I said go back to my last comment, if we were to move more deposit on to the balance sheet from off, obviously you've got to reserve capital against that.", "We did factor that into making sure we get an appropriate return on it. But from a shareholder perspective, we certainly believe that that would be the highest and best use of capital. Now once you go beyond that and we look at all the growth opportunities are already taking care of then you do of that some point look at other capital alternatives.", "Those discussions will probably happen later this year, we're talking about it. Nothing has been decided for sure. You'll hear more about it and my guess is we start to get closer to Q3, Q4. It's probably the next time or the time we'll price it down and start to articulate what our game plan is. And that's only if I would say we're really not driving forward ahead on the deposit side with pulling more of that onto the balance sheet.", "Christopher McGratty", "Thanks for that. In terms of when you do have those conversations there's obviously two - there's dividends and there's buybacks. Do you have - I know that neither are in a place today, but do you have preference or how you're thinking about potentially buying back stock, obviously multiple on book is pretty high, but also could be accretive to earnings?", "Daniel Beck", "This is Dan. I mean at this point, we're really considering all options and we don't have a preference as we're going into it.", "Christopher McGratty", "Thanks a lot.", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, you're welcome Chris.", "Operator", "From Sandler O'Neill, we have Aaron Deer. Please go ahead. Aaron, your line is open.", "Aaron Deer", "Hi, good afternoon everyone.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Aaron.", "Aaron Deer", "If I could follow-up on the accounting change, I guess I'm a little surprised actually if you're recapturing all of the unrealized gains that kind of the balance sheet. It sounds like you're still - if you're only suggesting 2 million to $3 million drop in the type of quarterly gains that you continue to realize, then it sounds like you're still anticipating some pretty good gains on those investments going forward, is that right?", "Daniel Beck", "Those investments have been held at cost, so those -- are the value was really sitting in those investments anyway. So now what we've done is through the change in accounting brought them to a fair value with the adjustment in equity. So that value because these funds were only distributing that value at the point that it was time to return capital, which is a long cycle.", "So these funds, we're nearing the end of their cycle and starting to contribute to our non-interest. So we marked it. It's sitting in equity and the expectation is that we're just not going to see that $2 million to $3 million of non-interest income on a quarterly basis, because it's already sitting in equity.", "Gregory Becker", "The only thing I would add on to it is, these are investments that were made a while back and because of the type of investments they were, they were held in our balance sheet at cost and so that's what we're talking about. But the core, what I'll call it SVB capital business and that's been the more significant driver of securities gains. That still is intact. That's not impacted by what we're talking about. So we're trying to make sure we dissect those two or separate those two - and want to give as much clarity as possible on what's happening with that those investments that were held at cost.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. And then how about the corresponding impact on the non-controlling adjustment, is it will there then be a similar magnitude impact there?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, there isn't one because again these are investments that we would hold [indiscernible] 100%. It's kind of ours. Therefore there is no non-controlling interest.", "Aaron Deer", "Okay. I just want to make sure. I understood that. And then just one last one, Greg, you'd mentioned the foreign exposure and looking to keep that below $10 billion for the time being, it sounds like you're at about $6 billion now. How much is that increased over the past year?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, so we've gone up, it's a roughly a couple billion dollars. So again if we have opportunities to optimize and we believe we do. You can effectively take roughly I would say $2 billion to $3 billion that we could optimize in the next 12 months. We continue on that growth path that kind of somewhat negates that. So you're really looking at a two to three year time horizon, based on kind of the current trajectory, right.", "And it Dan said in his remarks, if you really dig into it and you look at the - what the intent it was of the $10 billion dollars based on all the other regulatory changes that they're being discussed. This one again my opinion makes more sense than others even to move it changes or to give exceptions around it. So that's we're going to be talking about we're certainly hopeful about it and we'll keep everyone informed as we have more information.", "Aaron Deer", "Understood. Appreciate the clarification.", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] And from Piper Jaffrey we have Brett Rabatin. Please go ahead.", "Brett Rabatin", "Hi, Good afternoon.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Brett.", "Brett Rabatin", "I wanted to ask Greg early in your commentary, you talk about how there was obviously elevated valuations and private companies and that that could actually how somewhat of an impact on your credit quality? Are you expecting some sort of self-correction this year and some of those markets or what do you see happening as we move through the year to some of these private companies that are valued really high numbers?", "Gregory Becker", "Yes, I'll start and then let Mark comment some as well. So my only comment is that you - when you see all this liquidity coming in there clearly are companies that are raising healthy amounts of money and the valuations are what I'll call we said this and I could - this dialogue in about 2015 using the same words which were there price for perfection and anytime you see things that are priced for perfection obviously there is more area to the downside then to the upside typically speaking in those companies.", "And we're seeing that to some extent. What my commentary really is on credit quality, is that if you saw a significant amount around that were down around in a few minutes it would become more difficult to raise money that would in turn more than likely impact - some impact on our credit quality to an extent, right. We're not seeing it. We don't predict it. It's really just saying what are the things we're paying attention to and if we were to see it, we would certainly comment on it in future calls. Marc over to you.", "Marc Cadieux", "I think you captured it in your opening remarks as well in terms of what would potentially cause investor sentiment this hour. It really is not seeing exits at those valuations in the venture like returns. But as Greg stated, there's no imminent signs that that is likely to happen and so. For the moment, the outlook is what it is.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay. Appreciate the color there. And then I've seen on Twitter, Greg you make some comments about biopharma and some other industries. Is there a group in 2018 that you expect might lead to growth outside of TCP on the balance sheet in terms of loan portfolio?", "Gregory Becker", "Well, I don't know what tweets you saw, but I don't tweet, so it wouldn't have\u2026", "Brett Rabatin", "Through an email, I'm sorry.", "Gregory Becker", "Okay. You look and you say, my comments about higher valuations is pretty broad-based, almost any industry that you look outwards biopharma or certain software i.e. et cetera. There is going to be some of the higher profile companies in those industries that are at higher valuations, again priced for perfection. So my comments are, I would say pretty broad-based. We don't expect any anything to happen that's not what our outlook is predicting, but certainly the higher profile companies are getting healthy valuations.", "Brett Rabatin", "No, I'm sorry I didn't mean in terms of credit as it relate to that. I just meant in terms of the growth in the portfolio outside of the TCP.", "Gregory Becker", "I heard your comment. So we do expect actually in life sciences, technology, we expect more broad base growth this year than we've had in the last few years, although as we've certainly said if there is upside, it certainly is more than likely to come from private equity services.", "Now the only, again the only caution I would have is, if you saw a massive amount of M&A happen, if you did see equity grow at even faster pace, that could be create some headwinds. But it was nice to see in the fourth quarter, some tech banking growth. We think that is partially the market, but clearly part of it. How we're approaching the market and our teams, which is why we are pretty optimistic about 2018.", "Marc Cadieux", "Correct - the only other thing I would put on or add that considers the private bank, again we've been experiencing quite healthy growth over the last couple of years. So you'll definitely see some growth like that in 2018.", "Brett Rabatin", "Okay, great. Appreciate the color.", "Operator", "From Stephens, we have Tyler Stafford. Please go ahead.", "Tyler Stafford", "Hey, good afternoon guys.", "Gregory Becker", "Hi, Tyler.", "Tyler Stafford", "Hey, just one last one for me, I'm just trying to I guess better triangulate to the NII guide, with the loan and the deposit outlook and then the [3.35 to 3.45] margin. Can you help me with the size of the securities portfolio that's I guess more or less embedded in that guide? Does that assume securities balances down throughout the year?", "Daniel Beck", "So generally speaking, it assumes more of a flat level of the investment securities, but that's to some degree tied to the overall amount of deposit and liquidity that we have.", "Tyler Stafford", "Okay, so roughly security balance that should be flat?", "Daniel Beck", "That's roughly.", "Tyler Stafford", "Okay.", "Michael Descheneaux", "I mean you can kind of through it when you see the outlets and other words if you took that deposit growth outlook of mid single-digits right apply that to the deposit balance then compare that to the outlook for a loans that mid-teens to the balance we had, you can kind of see there within the vicinity there ballpark each other. So that would imply that investment security is not going to move that significantly right one way or the other.", "Tyler Stafford", "Yes, guess that's where I was going at a kind of first pass as I walked through it to hit that lower NII guide, it was kind of implying and security balances declining throughout the year, but I'll go back to that. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "At this point, we have no further questions. We'll now turn it back to CEO, Greg Becker for closing remarks.", "Gregory Becker", "Great, I just want to thank everyone for joining us today. We're closing at a great year and looking forward to continued growth and expansion in 2018. It's great, it's been a very long time to have some nice tailwinds, always feels like when these calls we're talking about headwinds and having three nice tailwinds with taxes and rates and hopefully more regulatory reforms going on. That's great and you couple that with the performance that our outlook clearly that's what gives us confidence in 2018.", "So I just want to thank all our amazing clients for their support in us as they do each call every - just we do have the best clients without question. I want to thank all our employees for doing such a great job of taking care of our clients, bring their best every day and thank everyone for joining us in the call.
